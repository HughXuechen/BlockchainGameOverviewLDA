Abstract Nowadays, Big Data is the most salient paradigm. It has become a game-
changer in the current technology and has aroused various industries and research
communities worldwide. Big Data-based applications have shown much potential in
data-driven decisions that have changed all business operations, including cost opti-
mization, online reputation, and customer loyalty. Nevertheless, Big Data also brings
many security and privacy issues. For this reason, BigData applications require accu-
rate methods to ensure reliable data storage, sharing, and decision-making. Among
these methods, the Blockchain is known as the clever combination of distributed
exchange, consensus, and cryptography mechanisms. It has been brought to the
forefront to resolve security challenges in various fields such as Healthcare, banking,
smart cities, etc. This paper first presents the considerable difficulties faced when
adoptingBigData that can be resolved usingBlockchain.Afterward,we overview the
Blockchain technology by projecting its components, workflows, classification, and
related characteristics. Finally, we present the importance of combining BigData and
Blockchain through reviewing the novel implementations proposed by researchers
in great domains.

1 Introduction
With the increase of people using the Internet, the amount of produced data is practi-
cally exploding by the day. This explosion opens up incredible processing opportuni-
ties for organizations, such as data sharing and data-driven decisions (Faroukhi et al.
2020) and proposing customizable services. However, this noteworthy and extensive
usage also comes with the necessity of ensuring the security and protection of data
storage and transmissions (Gahi et al. 2016).
It is worth noting that this vast data, also known as Big data, is, most of the
time, very sensitive (Gahi et al. 2016) as it represents a direct projection of our day-
to-day activities. Big data is closely related to our personal life as it mainly relies
on our transactions, interactions, and pattern mining. As Big data becomes a grand
reality, it has to be clearly defined. Since the 2000s, many characteristics have been
associated with Big data (El Alaoui et al. 2019), such as Volume, Variety, Velocity,
Value, Veracity, Variability, and Visualization. Also known as 7Vs (El Alaoui and
Gahi 2019), see Fig. 1.
Because of these varied characteristics, ensuring security using traditional
methods becomes a complex task (Hu et al. 2014). For example, many conventional
security techniques cannot handle the scale and velocity required by Big Data-based
applications.
To overcome the scalability and velocity aspects, distributed approaches should
be used. These approaches are designed to run over large clusters, which are a set
of interconnected machines. Big Data systems’ common distribution aspect makes
Blockchain technology an ultimate solution for Big Data security challenges. It
allows copingwith security issues related to sharing and storingBigData by applying
cryptography, decentralization, consensus principles, and ensuring transaction trust.

Moreover, today, Blockchain technology has become an ideal fit for Big Data prob-
lems through its high capacity to prevent the significant malicious activities caused
by cybercriminals. The Blockchain not only restricts the intruders but also ensures
access to multiple nodes in the network. This safeguarding feature of Blockchain
strengthens and boosts the security level compared to many unique technologies
used in various enterprises such as the cloud or virtual private network, or any other
technology.
For this reason,many researchers have taken a keen interest in proposing attractive
and diverse Blockchain models and frameworks to share and securely store Big Data
in various sectors, namely Healthcare, Banking, IoT, gaming, and smart applications.
In this contribution, we focus on reviewing the recent studies that have tackled
Big Data and Blockchain and their alliance. Furthermore, we discuss the advantage
and the limits of the proposed models.
The following research questions will guide this contribution:
• What are the application domains of blockchain technology in the context of Big
data?
• How does Blockchain technology address the challenge of Big data security?
• What are the significant challenges remaining in the usage of Blockchain as a
secure solution for Big data intelligent applications?
This paper is organized as follows: in the second snd third sections, we present
the research methodology, and we overview the concept of Blockchain technology
by showing its components, workflows, and related characteristics. Afterward, in the
fourth section, we highlight exciting studies based on Blockchain brought to various
domains such as the healthcare field, smart cities, IoT, Vanets, 5G networks, Banking,
and Game theory. Then in Sect. 5, we discuss the importance of using Blockchain in
the context of Big Data. Finally, we conclude the paper and show some future works.
2 Research Methodology
To carry out this paper, we have used a systematic review methodology to iden-
tify and summarize the relevant research contributions that answer the above ques-
tions. According to (Tranfield et al. 2003) standards, we have conducted our review
to develop a review plan regarding the methods to be used and the main research
questions to be outlined and reports to be extracted.
This literature review highlighted the critical role of the outstanding Blockchain
technology in coping with Big data challenges in numerous domains.
We took three stages to perform this study:
1. First of all, we researched and identified multiple primary papers related to our
topic.
2. Secondly, we filtered the primary chosen papers.
3. Finally, we validated the filtered articles for data synthesis and analysis.
244 R. Benaich et al.
The primary studies were chosen based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria
applied to the reviewed publications, the study’s scope, and verifications done by
subject and title and reading the abstract and findings.
This research method enables the investigation to be focused on papers published
in renowned academic journals such as IEEE Xplore, Springer, Google Scholar,
Wiley online library, ACM digital library, web of science, and so forth.
In our research approach, we covered various papers and magazines that were
published in recent years. This allowed us to illustrate the progression of the thoughts.
Therefore, we selected particular keywords such as “BigData,” “Blockchain,” “Secu-
rity,” and “Blockchain applications” to assure a superior approach in literature
research.
A considerable number of articles on the order of 300 were found through the
selection of source research. A relevant and rigorous study of cross-referenced and
redundant keyword combinations was used to refine this first bundle. A total of 180
articles were chosen, which were then subjected to a more in-depth study.
The filtered papers were carefully studied and assessed to ensure that they were
relevant to the subject of our research. The last group consisted of 100 articles.
3 An Overview of Blockchain Technology
Blockchain is undoubtedly a brilliant invention, which has been introduced in 2008
by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto (Nakamoto). It is a register where data is
stored and kept by a decentralized system of computers. The Oxford dictionary
is described as “A system in which a record of transactions made in Bitcoin or
another cryptocurrency is maintained across several computers that are linked in a
peer-to-peer network.” This technology, based on trust, redefines our relationship to
information and value transfers.
Blockchain architecture is composed of a set of functional components. Themajor
ones are:
• Nodes: nodes are an essential component of Blockchain that allows access to data.
They act as a communication point and perform multiple tasks such as ensuring
the reliability of stored data (2021) in the Blockchain network.
• Block: it contains the block header and many transactions. The block header is
hashed repeatedly to generate proof of work for mining rewards. Also, the block
header serves to locate a specific block on an entire Blockchain.
• Transactions: defined as an exchange of assets, processed and managed under
some specific rules of the entity service.
• Smart contract: is an autonomous agent unfalsifiable and permanent. Smart
contracts are logical rules in coded text embedded in a file Blockchain to manage
transactions.

Fig. 2 Blockchain workflow
• Merkle tree: also known as a binary hash tree, it is a tree in which each leaf node
is marked by the hash value of the block transaction data. Merkle trees are used
to effectively and securely encode Blockchain data.
An overview of the Blockchain workflow is shown in Fig. 2.
The procedure shown in Fig. 2 works as follows:
• The first step consists of initiating and broadcasting a transaction to the distributed
network via a node.
• After that, all Blockchain network nodes verify the transaction (the node that
performs the broadcast).
• More than one node can bundle different subgroups of the newly verified transac-
tions in their candidate constituencies and broadcast them over the entire network
in the third step.
• In the fourth step, some nodes or the entire network nodes validate blocks by
executing functions defined by consensus protocol.
• The last step consists of the attachment of the verified block to Blockchain, and
finally, all nodes update their local replica.
The Blockchain can be classified into the following categories depending on its
usage (Viriyasitavat and Hoonsopon 2019):
• Public: public Blockchains are decentralized and visible by anyone, and they
don’t have a specific owner, for example (Bitcoin, Ethereum).
• Private or Permissioned: they require some rules and privileges to manage and
control who can read and write to the Blockchain.
• Hybrid or Consortium: these Blockchains are public only to a specific group.
The consensus process is controlled by known, privileged servers using all parties’
rules.
It is also important to mention that Blockchain technology is acknowledged with
these main characteristics (Yaga et al. 2018):
• Decentralized: a key Blockchain feature. It means that Blockchain does not have
to depend on location nodes anymore. Data can be recorded, stored, and updated
for distribution.
• Immutable: every time a record of transactions is added, it’s permanent and
cannot be changed.
246 R. Benaich et al.
• Consensus: Trust verification, Blockchain provides some protocols such as Proof
of Work, Proof of stake, and Byzantine Fault Tolerance to verify each block
separately.
• Transparent: all transactions are visible to all the existing nodes in the network.
• Anonymity and identity: it is one of the major features of public Blockchain.
It means that there’s no need for a central organization to ensure privacy.
Furthermore, a user can avoid exposure by obtaining different identities.
• Tamper-proof ledger: the usage of cryptography ensures the security of all trans-
actions done in the network. They cannot be modified or altered until all nodes
are compromised.
Combining these inherent attributes has made Blockchain a viable solution for
Big data issues such as security. As a result, researchers have proposed attractive
models based on big data and Blockchain to ensure the security of Big Data-based
applications.
The following section presents this noteworthy healthcare, banking, smart cities,
IoT, VANETs, and 5G.
4 Blockchain in the Service of Big Data
Researchers use Blockchain for different security aims in the context of Big Data.
In this section, we first emphasize the security aims by reviewing recent researches
in various domains. Then, we compare these studies by showing their benefits and
limits.
4.1 Healthcare Field
Healthcare is a critical and essential domain that has attracted massive attention from
researchers. As a result, several studies have proposed and enhanced Blockchain
models to cope with several healthcare challenges in the context of Big Data.
Blockchain technology redefines the data modeling and management embedded
in many health care systems (Liang et al. 2017b). This is mainly due to its adapt-
ability and differentiation capabilities, security, and sharing of information and
medical services unprecedentedly. One of the most crucial usages of Big Data and
Blockchain is securing and sharing personal health data obtained from wearable
devices such as smartwatches and activity trackers via the creation of a user-centric
health data sharing based on decentralized and permissioned Blockchain. This solu-
tion offers data security via the deployment of a channel formation scheme. Further-
more, it ensures the enhancement of identitymanagement via themembership service
provided byBlockchain (Liang et al. 2017b). It also allows the prevention of any alter-
ation of the patients’ health data through applying a proof of integrity and validation
Securing Big Data-Based Smart Applications … 247
that is continuously reachable from a cloud database then linked to the Blockchain
network. Another potential of Blockchain that should not be overlooked is its capa-
bility to surmount vulnerabilities in the old sharingmethods, such as the inappropriate
access of data and the integration of malicious programs.
Also, Blockchain is used in pharmacy (Clauson et al. 2018) and helps to control
and secure themedication return process. In this regard, the Blockchain has shown its
potential toward the product (medicines) tracing by allowing manufacturers, distrib-
utors, and pharmacists to submit tracing information in a shared ledger, with auto-
mated verification of critical data. Besides, Blockchain has demonstrated a potential
toward detection and response and enables public and private actors to report and
identify medicines suspected of imitation, illegal, or dangerous. Therefore, the safety
of medications increases without disclosing sensitive information.
It is also important to mention that the interest in the Blockchain has drastically
increased during the pandemic of COVID-19 (Abd-alrazaq et al. 2021). According to
theEuropeanParliamentaryResearchService, theBlockchainwas considered among
the ten powerful technologies which have reduced COVID-19 challenges (Mihalis
Kritikos 2020). It is used to track public health information, particularly outbreaks of
infectious diseases. Combining both Blockchain and Big Data enables real-time data
processing, further preventing the spread of the disease to epidemic levels. It also
allows obtaining more accurate reporting and effective responses. However, these
effective responses are insufficient without safeguarding the patient’s information,
which requires a high level of security. Hence, by health information exchange based
on the Blockchain, the privacy of the patient is ensured. The aspect of securing
each patient’s medical data is obtained by deploying an electronic medical record
Blockchain that uses on and off-chain storage verification records (Ahir et al. 2020).
4.2 Banking Field
Blockchain is widely used in the banking sector and has many advantages in the Big
Data context. This innovation reduces the risk of fraud and prevents some potential
scams in all banking environments, such as financial and online markets (Hassani
et al. 2018) via monitoring and recording every change of the data within the blocks
for every transaction in real-time. Furthermore, blockchain technology is considered
a trusted network for the digital banking sector due to its encryption capabilities and
public key infrastructure. Additionally, the distributed ledger “Blockchain” offers
another aspect that should not be neglected, relying on the difficulty of operating the
newly added data by various units in real-time. This difficulty results in enhanced
privacy of the massive data transiting.
Blockchain also addresses various issues such as operational risk and admin-
istrative costs. Furthermore, integrating Blockchain and Big Data into the finan-
cial sector optimizes multiple processes, such as creating new financial services
and ensuring the integration of the performance and profitability of actors (micro-
credit, micro-payment transactions almost free of charge, and so forth. These benefits
248 R. Benaich et al.
could be obtained through using a cost-cutting technique, “transaction commitment,”
that drastically decreases transaction time and storage for small amounts of money
(Rezaeibagha and Mu 2019).
Furthermore, Blockchain and Big Data allow enhancing the security of banking
transactions highly. They would generate new revenue models, capacity gains,
cost reduction of millions, and significant losses across the industry. It is also
worth noting that many analysts predict positive growth of the level of trust of
customers due to the combination of Blockchain andBigData. This combinationwill
change customers and banks, insurers, and other financial institutions by identifying
suspicious transactions by tracking customer transactions and activities in real-time.
4.3 Smart Applications
In recent years, the notion of “smart city” has emerged as a new paradigm to enhance
citizen’s daily life, by providing personalized and adapted services. This paradigm
is based on personal data that are closely related to our daily basis. However, they
are several challenges related to security and storage in smart city systems. For this
reason, the idea of securing the data aroused the interest of many researchers.
Many studies have tackled the smart city field by proposing new methods and
practices. Themajor one is the combination of Blockchain and BigData. This combi-
nation provides secure communication between physical devices in a heterogeneous
environment through real-time datamonitoring. It also provides the quality of service
(QoS) byminimizing traffic rate fluctuations and the diversity of new devices (Alam).
Furthermore, Blockchains can be used to create a smart city system that enables
devices to securely and reliably transfer currency and data between all smart city
devices.
Also, the combination of Big Data and Blockchain is widely used in smart trans-
portation, especially in the automotive industry. This combination has revolution-
ized intelligent transportation systems (ITS) by building safe, dependant and self-
sufficient ITS ecosystems to provide services such as remote software-based vehicle
operation (Deepa et al. 2021).In the same context of smart transportation security,
it is noteworthy that (Wang and Qu 2019) have created a secure critical manage-
ment architecture based on Blockchain technology to provide network security. This
solution is based on using security managers to record vehicle departure data, encap-
sulate the blocks to transfer keys, and then deploy rekeying to the cars within the
secured domain. This framework provides a key management system for critical
transfers among security administrators in a heterogeneous vehicle network. Other
researchers have proposed an interesting system that ensure the security of vehicles
using Blockchain (Hîrţan et al. 2020). This system is based on an offline Blockchain
storage system. All confidential data gathered from users is kept and then shared
with the help of unique encryption keys applicable to a specific vehicle cluster. The
Securing Big Data-Based Smart Applications … 249
solution comprises two applications, the first one is installed on the client’s smart-
phone, and the second is installed on the server. It has shown the capacity to ensure
privacy policies sent to the client’s application to offer the precise transit routes.
Furthermore, the combination of Big Data and Blockchain allows managing the
security issues such as protocol vulnerabilities, privacy, eavesdropping, and attacks
on internet-connected devices and vehicle communication networks (Ismagilova
et al. 2020).
4.4 Game Theory
Today, most gaming platforms are hosted on centralized servers, and transactions
are frequently conducted on mobile phones or desktop computers that lack adequate
security (Jacob 2020). In fact, because of this centralization aspect, servers could
be easily hacked. Furthermore, this lack of server security could lead to enormous
damages such as data loss or interruption of services. Therefore, many studies have
tackled the combination of Blockchain and Big Data in gaming to cover these risks.
This combination has brought the potential to change the vulnerability of centralized
servers. Hackers will be unable to damage a decentralized Blockchain network since
(i) there is no server to destroy, (ii) nodes share the maintenance of distributed
databases, (iii) each node has complete information in the database. As a result,
players can safely store digital collectibles purchased in Blockchain-based games in
their crypto wallets (Aran Davies 2020).
Furthermore, due to the decentralization aspect of Blockchain, trust is established
between all nodes; players are unable to modify the data. This means that trust is
built between all players in the industry, from developers to actors (Gainsbury and
Blaszczynski 2017). Also, the Blockchain permit gamers to make their payments in
a secure way using digital crypto coins.
Besides the security aspect, the Blockchain also offers new features to the gaming
world, such as digital trade assets between players (Casino et al. 2019). The use
of intermediary sites obtains this ability of digital trading. In addition, to provide
user-friendly functions and interfaces for running shared data (Robin8 2019).
Another aspect of Blockchain technology resides in solving data instability in
peer-to-peer games by providing data authentication and permanent storage via a new
proof-of-play consensus methodology underpins this serverless turn-based strategy
game (Wu et al. 2020). This solution is based on three key steps: matchmaking,
gaming session, and gameplay.
4.5 Internet of Things
The Internet of things (IoT) refers to the billions of physical devices deployed
worldwide connected to the Internet (Atzori et al. 2010). These devices collect and
250 R. Benaich et al.
share massive data. Thus, they allow conducting data analysis for better and faster
decision-making. However, there are many security issues, such as data leaks and
vulnerabilities concerning physical equipment; hackers can easily alter that.
For this reason, Blockchain was introduced to ensure privacy and to face chal-
lenges related to IoT security. Using Blockchain as the basis of devices reduces
the possibility of hacking by decreasing malicious programs and spyware (Banerjee
et al. 2018). In this context, the Blockchain was introduced to trace the history of the
firmware. If a corrupted firmware is identified, it will be driven to revert to its prior
version. Also, the Blockchain was brought to the front line to maintain the Refence
Integrity Metric (RIM) of the datasets by storing membership informations such as
the address, owner, and sharing policies.
Furthermore, Blockchain technology allows protecting IoT networks against
potential entry points of intruders without the need of a central authority. Therefore,
Blockchain is considered a leading solution for organizations involved in auditing,
tracing a supply chain, or securing connected streetlights in intelligent cities due to
the encryption capability of Blockchain, its dispersed storage, and its irrefutable,
tamper-proof record (Plummer and Writer 2018).
Besides the security aspect, Blockchain creates a marketplace that allows data
providers (IoT sensors) and data consumers (IoT application owners) to trade in
real-time via smart contracts and makes value from collected data (Jain 2021).
Another breakthrough of blockchain use in IoT is embodied in a reliable and
flexible solution designed for IoT services, specifically the adoption of drones in
various IoT scenarios, namely agriculture, delivery, and so forth. In fact, (Liang
et al. 2017b) have proposed a solution that consists of using a public Blockchain and
the standard cloud server in which the hashed data records collected from drones
are anchored to the Blockchain network. After that, a Blockchain receipt for each
data record stored in the cloud is generated to reduce the burden of moving drones
with limited battery and processing capability while gaining improved data security
assurance. In addition, this usage provides trust, data capability integrity audit, data
convenience, and scalability.
4.6 Big Data and Blockchain in the Service of VANETs
VANETs are one of the most brilliant inventions of the century. However, they
still include many challenges that could be resolved with Blockchain. Such as
data management and security in a vehicular environment. For example, the usage
of Blockchain inVANETs enables essential functionalities such as ensuring traffic
safety and parking space management through promoting decentralized system
management (Peng et al. 2020).
Furthermore, Blockchain played a pivotal role in resolving critical message
dissemination issues in VANETs via storing the history of vehicle trust level in
Blockchain and event messages (Shrestha et al. 2020). Thus, when a car experi-
ences an event, such as an accident, the event message with various parameters is
Securing Big Data-Based Smart Applications … 251
broadcasted to nearby vehicles in the Blockchain network. Also, Blockchain allows
the preservation of the circulation of untrustworthy information sent by malicious
vehicles. In addition to these advantages, using Blockchain and Big Data’s combi-
nation as a security feature of the VANET network allows strengthening network
security and facilitating data transmission. Lu et al. (2018) have implemented a
Blockchain-based anonymous reputation system that builds a trust paradigm for
VANETs. This paradigm enables the transparency of certificates and revocations
to be efficiently accomplished through proofs of presence and absence based on
enhanced Blockchain technology and conditional anonymity via public keys. This
level of protection is guaranteed via a trust-based Blockchain design that effectively
mitigates multiple network attacks such as (DoS attack and Sybil attack) (Khan
et al. 2019). These attacks become almost non-existent since the potential of altering
centralized data storage has become remarkably decreased through the application of
consortium Blockchain-based data sharing for VANETS (Zhang and Chen 2019).In
other words, given the tamper resistance property of Blockchain, the operation of
data sharing become more controlled. The deployment of consortium Blockchain
resides in sending each vehicle data to the nearest roadside units (RSU). Then, the
RSUs function as pre-selected nodes that construct blocks based on data from the
connected vehicles. At this stage, the Blockchain that contains the vehicle data is
created by obtaining consensus among RSUs. Consequently, the RSUs control the
data sharing process via intelligent contract technology provided by the distributed
ledger technology.
However, despite the critical role of Blockchain in VANETs, research is still
lacking, mainly concerning real-time and scalability. Moreover, the mobility of
VANETs creates difficulty in proof of work in the Blockchain because of the
continuous dynamicity of Blockchain nodes (Kim 2019).
4.7 The Fifth Generation Based Applications (5G)
The novel features of 5G allow supporting new business models and services,
including mobile operators, businesses, call providers, government executives, and
infrastructure providers. However, they also face many challenges, such as data
mobility and network privacy (Nguyen et al. 2019).
For this reason, several studies have proposed various Blockchain models to
address 5G challenges in the context of Big Data. Moreover, blockchain char-
acteristics offer promising solutions to 5G’s challenges. One of these essen-
tial Blockchain features is decentralization, which allows for banishing external
authorities’ requirements in the 5G ecosystem.
In other words, decentralization of 5G networks enables avoiding single-point
failures and ensuring data availability (Nguyen et al. 2019). It is also important to
note that Blockchain offers high security for 5G networks due to smart contracts that
support the services of 5G, such as preservation of 5G resources against alteration
and data authentification (Nguyen et al. 2019).
252 R. Benaich et al.
Furthermore, Blockchain provides immutability to the 5G network performs
multiple tasks such as (usage information for billing, resource utilization, and trend
analysis).
Besides the security and immutability aspects, the Blockchain allows to ensures
transparency of the 5G services, enabling service providers and users to fully access,
verify, and monitor transaction activities over the network with equal rights (Nguyen
et al. 2019). Furthermore, as mentioned above, Blockchain reveals a sequence of
security features that remove the need for centralized network infrastructure or third-
party authorities and decrease the single point failure. Furthermore, the security of
device-to-device (D2D) communication may be achieved by constructing a peer-to-
peer network using Blockchain. This converts eachD2D device as a Blockchain node
to maintain a ledge replica of validating and monitoring transactions to improve the
system’s transparency and dependability (Nguyen et al. 2019).
All the above studies have designed exciting solutions based on Blockchain
and Big data to face many fields. The table below summarizes these solutions by
presenting the significant covered challenges and showing their limits and advantages
(Table 1).
5 Discussion
Through this paper, we highlighted how security challenges related to Big Data
could be resolved with Blockchain. Researchers have proposed Blockchain models
and frameworks to face many security challenges in diverse Healthcare, banking,
IoT, and so forth.
By reviewing these studies, we have noticed that Blockchain played a pivotal role
in securing and preserving data privacy through its decentralization, tamper-proof,
and immutability attributes. Moreover, far beyond, the combination of Big Data and
Blockchain has assured the security of the data by creating partitioning models based
on smart contracts. Accordingly, the data sharing models are generated without the
need for a reliable third party.
Besides the security aspect provided byBlockchain,many outstanding advantages
are emerging in the implementation of Blockchain claimed by several studies. For
instance, transparency and a remarkable reduction of the costs of data storage. This
significant minimization of the cost is achieved via the Blockchain storage capacity,
which allows storing a large amount of data for long periods instead of using shared
data holding platforms, which require many resources. In this process, Blockchain
relies on the automatic performance of transactions that are supervised by smart
contracts.
Moreover, due to the transparency and decentralization aspects of Blockchain
technology, users can look through the record of all transactions.
Despite the advances brought by the usage of both Blockchain and Big Data. A lot
of issues still unreliable and require more research. Scalability is an example of these
problems; it is knownas a critical requirement ofBigData.Companies and businesses

Securing Big Data-Based Smart Applications … 261
cannot efficiently handle and process the exploding volume of data without using
data scaling techniques. Moreover, the lack of standardization is another drawback
of combining Blockchain and Big Data. In other words, standardization denotes
a minimal degree of interoperability, such as (different Blockchain networks and
different consensus models).
The interoperability problem leads to increased resources used in transactions
generated by users in various blockchain networks. Also, without standardiza-
tion, sharing data and value between participants in divergent Blockchain networks
becomes complex or almost impossible. Furthermore, another limit of the adop-
tion of Blockchain in the service of Big Data is redundancy. This limit highlights
the fundamental issue of decentralization attributes brought by Blockchain. In other
words, redundancy means that every node in the Blockchain network must traverse
and process each intermediate node independently (Mudrakola 2018) to target the
objective node in the network. As a result, the redundancy inherent in Blockchain
technology has an impact on its efficiency.
Additionally, Blockchain faces another limit related to signature verification. The
employment of this signature verification in Blockchain technology means that each
transaction made in the Blockchain network should be verified and signed digitally
using private or public keys. Consequently, the computation of this signature verifi-
cation process becomes highly complex and takes a long time. This limit hampers
the alliance of Blockchain with Big Data.
6 Conclusion
The technology of Blockchain is considered a hot topic given its robust features
and good advantages. Today, Blockchain’s importance has extended far beyond the
financial sector and has shown notable improvements, especially toward security
concerns. On the other side, Big Data must be handled securely and accurately to
avoid any interruption or loss of the data. Therefore, Blockchain has been brought
to the front line in Big Data contexts. In this paper, we have presented the alliance
of Blockchain with Big Data to cope with Big Data storing and sharing security
issues. For this, we have overviewed the multiple advantages and limits of different
Blockchain researches that have tackled Big data issues inmany sectors ranging from
health and technology (IoT, 5G, VANETs, Smart field) to entertainment concerns.
Despite the advancement brought by Blockchain technology, there are still plenty
of challenging issues concerning the use of Blockchain in the context of big data,
such as interoperability and scalability. However, distributed ledger technology is
still maturing. Moreover, it can be linked to new-age technologies, such as artificial
intelligence and IoT, to build platforms and infrastructures that ensure advanced data
privacy and security.
As future work, we propose a Blockchain model that copes with unsolved Big
data security issues such as scalability and standardization.
