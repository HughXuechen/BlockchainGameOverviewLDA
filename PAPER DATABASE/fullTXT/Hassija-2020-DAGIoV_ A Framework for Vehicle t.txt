Abstract—Data sharing and content offloading among vehicles is
an imperative part of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). A peer-to-peer
connection among vehicles in a distributed manner is a highly
promising solution for fast communication among vehicles. To
ensure security and data tracking, existing studies use blockchain
as a solution. The Blockchain-enabled Internet of Vehicles (BIoV)
requires high computation power for the miners to mine the blocks
and let the chain grow. Over and above, the blockchain consensus
is probabilistic and the block generated today can be eventually
declared as a fork and can be pruned from the chain. This reduces
the overall efficiency of the protocol because the correct work done
initially is eventually not used if it becomes a fork. To address these
challenges, in this paper, we propose a Directed Acyclic Graph
enabled IoV (DAGIoV) framework. We make use of a tangle data
structure where each node acts as a miner and eventually the
network achieves consensus among the nodes. A game-theoretic
approach is used to model the interactions between the vehicles
providing and consuming offloading services. The proposed model
is proven to be highly scalable and well suited for microtransac-
tions or frequent data transfer among the nodes in the vehicular
network.

I. INTRODUCTION
W ITH the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) applications
and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), a large
amount of data is getting generated in vehicular networks [1].
The vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communication is an important
enabling factor in enhancing the driving safety and comfort of
the users [2]. Various applications have been developed in recent
years to avoid accidents, pileup crashes, vehicle platooning
or traffic jams using V2V and Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I)
communication models [3]. Various big companies such as Audi
(Germany), General Motors (U.S.), BMW (Germany), Volvo
Cars (Sweden), Daimler AG (Germany), Toyota Motor Corpora-
tion (Japan), Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (U.S.), Volkswagen
(Germany) and AutoTalks Ltd. (Israel) are actively participat-
ing in funding and developing applications that support V2V
communication [2]. The expected revenue of global Vehicle to
Vehicle (V2V) communication Market by 2023 is predicted to
be USD 24 Billion [1].
Additionally, a lot of research and implementation is going on
in direction of automated driving [4], [5]. Various self driving
vehicles are being developed in countries like Japan, U.S.A, Ger-
many and so on. The inter vehicular communication becomes
even more important in case of self driving vehicles [6], [7].
A lot of data needs to be shared and collected among vehicles
to actually experience driving safety and improved Quality of
Experience (QoE) [8], [9].
There have been various attempts in the recent years to-
ward developing a robust framework for vehicular communi-
cation [10], [11]. However, most of these attempts are based
on centralized network architectures [12]. There are various
security and privacy issues involved in sharing data over these
centralized servers and therefore the users are not highly mo-
tivated to share their data [13]. In addition, these centralized
applications act as a single point of failure and some issues in
the central server can paralyze the entire vehicular network [14].
Data theft and data manipulation are another area of concern in
centralized applications. A Peer-to-Peer (P2P) communication
model among vehicles can be a highly promising solution to
avoid such issues related to centralized applications [15], [16].
However, a robust and reliable trust management system is
required in a P2P network to be able to actually leverage its
advantages [17], [18].

Few attempts have been made toward integrating blockchain
technology with vehicular communication to realize a se-
cure peer-to-peer communication model [15], [19]. Although,
blockchain can help in securely authorizing the peers to commu-
nicate in a vehicular network, there are some fundamental con-
straints in blockchain architecture that obstructs the scalability
and efficiency of such frameworks [20], [21]. Blockchain basi-
cally depends on the Proof-of-Work (POW) consensus mecha-
nism to reach to a consensus among the peers in the network [22],
[23]. Various miners are involved in solving a mathematical
puzzle and whoever is able to solve the puzzle first is allowed
to attach the latest set of transactions to the main chain. The
miners are incentivized in order to get motivated to participate
in the mining process. The mining process involves a lot of
computation power and the overall efficiency of the process
is low because ultimately the work of only one miner for a
particular transaction is kept in the main chain. Many miners
parallely work on a single set of transactions and the blocks cre-
ated by all the miners except one (miner whose block got added
in longest chain) are eventually pruned from the main chain and
are considered as the forks. Such pruning and forking greatly
affects the efficiency of the process. Various alternative consen-
sus algorithms have been proposed in recent years to avoid the
issues related to POW mechanism such as proof-of-stake (POS),
proof-of-burn (POB) and proof-of-reputation (POR) [24], [25].
However, the fundamental constraints of forking and lack of
efficiency more or less continue to exist in these algorithms as
well [26], [27]. Additionally, these algorithms do not support
micro-transactions among the participating nodes [28], [29].
However, such small value transactions are an imperative part
of a fast V2V communication model [30], [31].
In this paper, a fast, secure, and light-weight peer-to-peer
communication model is presented for vehicular networks. The
proposed model leverages the features of a tangle data structure
used in IOTA to support frequent and small value transactions in
a P2P network. The proposed model maintains all the benefits
provided by blockchain and resolves the fundamental constraints
introduced by blockchain. A game theoretic approach is used
to map the service providers and consumers for performing
offloading services in a cost-optimal way in vehicular network.
Fig. 4 shows the pictorial representation of the V2V network.
The vehicles communicate with each other as well as with the
Road Side Units (RSUs) to get the required data or information.
More specifically, the major contributions of this work are
summarized as follows:
� A peer-to-peer vehicular network is proposed where ve-
hicles can securely communicate and can perform data
offloading.
� The directed acyclic graph (DAG) data structure is used to
store and validate the transactions in the network and IOTA
based consensus mechanism is used to bring the nodes to
a final agreement about the order of transactions.
� A game theoretic model is presented to negotiate and
choose the best service provider in a cost-optimal way.
� Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed model
achieves the lowest communication cost and can support
frequent micro transactions.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The recent
works related to V2V communication models are presented in
Section II. Some background information about the DAG chain
and decentralized V2V communication model is presented in
Section III. Section IV presents the optimal price formulation
strategy for cost-optimal data offloading. In Section V the sim-
ulation results are presented and are compared with the existing
models for data offloading in V2V communication. Section VI
finally concludes the paper.

RELATED WORK ON VEHICLE TO VEHICLE COMMUNICATION
II. RELATED WORK
Various attempts are being made both in industry and
academia to enhance the capabilities of V2V communica-
tion model, and to allow seamless and secure communica-
tion among vehicles. The authors in [33] have used deep
reinforcement learning to schedule the operations of a con-
nected vehicular network. A Q-network is used, which learns a
scheduling policy from high-dimensional inputs and schedules
the upcoming transactions accordingly. Authors of [8], [32]
have proposed to use 3-D massive multiple input multi-
ple output (MIMO) based model to support vehicular com-
munication. A spherical wavefront is assumed in contrast
to the regular plane wavefront in the traditional MIMO
models.
The authors in [35] have proposed a pricing model for content
sharing and media streaming among vehicles. An unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV) is placed between V2V users to assist inter
cell communication. Authors of [2] have proposed a model for
short-range vehicle to vehicle communication based on infrared-
signal direction. Short-range communication is effective to avoid
collisions in V2V communication.
The authors in [3] have proposed a model to predict the
behavior of the vehicles that are beyond line of sight of the
receiving vehicle to avoid future accidents. A causality detector
is created to ensure the relevancy of the received information.
Authors of [14] have discussed a Platooning technique to re-
duce the distance among the vehicles to avoid the probability
of congestion. A power control mechanism and sub channel
allocation schemes are discussed for V2V communications in a
multi-platooning scenario. THe authors in [34] have discussed
a model for cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) to
monitor and control the movement of connected vehicles in
mixed traffic.
All these works are more or less based on centralized network
architectures. Few other recent attempts have been made toward
creating a distributed architecture of V2V network based on
blockchain [36]. A privacy preserving and trust management
system based on blockchain for secure internet of vehicles is
discussed in [37]. The proposed model removes the funda-
mental constraints in blockchain based network architectures.
The model also allows iterative auctioning by the vehicles to
gain the required amount of bandwidth for data offloading
scenarios.
III. NETWORK MODEL AND PRELIMS
To minimize the computation and create a distributed net-
work, IOTA based distributed ledger technology proves to be a
highly promising solution. In IOTA, a directed acyclic graph
(DAG) also referred as tangle is used as a data structure to
store the transactions among the nodes in the network. Both
vehicles and RSUs act as the nodes in the proposed model. It is
assumed that each vehicle can directly communicate with other
vehicles and RSUs in a range of 200 meters. The RSUs can also
communicate with each other. The transactions that occur in the
IOTA network contain vehicular data such as current global po-
sitioning system (GPS) coordinates, vehicle speed, acceleration
and heading direction. Some other detailed information such
as vehicle’s brake status, data transmission state, path history,
steering wheel angle, and path predictions can also be included
if required. All this information is shared among vehicles and
RSUs as per requirement. In this section the system model and
the prelims for network model creation for V2V communication
are discussed.
A. System Model
Fig. 2 shows the detailed steps involved in the proposed model
to achieve cost-optimal data offloading in vehicle to RSU and
vehicle to vehicle scenarios. Following are the steps that are
being followed in the Figure to illustrate the system model of
the proposed framework.
1) The first box shows the process of adding all the transac-
tions in the IOTA tangle data structure. Here transaction
refers to any communication or exchange between the
vehicles or RSUs. The tangle data structure records all
the events and all the new events are verified by the older
events. The different colours in the tangle signify the status
of verification of these transactions. The red colour events
are not yet verified and the blue coloured transactions are
been verified by other previous transactions. The transac-
tion colour changes to green only when it reaches a state
of consensus finality.
2) The second box shows the scenario of bandwidth auction
between vehicles and RSUs as discussed in more detail
in section IV-A. Here, the RSU gets the required data
from the cellular network. The RSU has a fixed limited
bandwidth and multiple vehicles demand for the data from

the RSU. An auction is done among the vehicles and RSU
to provide best possible bandwidth to all vehicles as an
optimal price.
3) The third box shows the scenario of bandwidth auction
among vehicles. In this case the vehicle demanding the
data is outside the range of the RSU that is carrying the
data. Therefore, the RSU chooses to transfer the data in
form of packets through other vehicles that are in the range
of RSU. This scenario is also explained in good detail in
section IV-B.
B. Digital Identity
Vehicles and RSUs act as nodes in the proposed network. Each
node has a unique digital identity that is used to communicate
with the other nodes in the network. Digital identity is the
combination of the private key and the public address of the
node [38]. To discuss about the key generation process, it is first
important to discuss some basic terms such as seed, security
level, and index. The seed, denoted by S is a type of secret
identity of each node that is used to generate multiple unique
addresses and signatures for all the transactions being issued
in the network. Security level, denoted by C decides the length
of the private key, higher the security level longer is the private
key. The private key of vehicle is generated using Cryptographic
Sponge Function (CSF) that takes input as seed, index, and
security level as shown in Eqn. (1).
Privatekey = CSF (S + I + C) (1)
Here index is an important parameter that helps in maintaining
a unique identity for each vehicle along with the private seed.
It is assumed that when any new node enters into the network it
is assigned to a new index I = 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .., N to maintain the
uniqueness of identity. The private key generated from Eqn. (1)
is further divided into key fragments. To create an address, the
private key is split into 81 tryte segments. Then, each segment is
hashed 26 times. A group of 27 hashed segments is called a key
fragment. Key digest denoted by K = k1, k2, k3, k4, . . .., kn is
generated by passing the key fragments through a hash function.
Further, the unique addresses for all transactions are generated
by passing the different key digests through a CSF as shown in
Eqn. (2).
Address = CSF

C. Tangle Creation
Once the nodes get their digital identity they can start issuing
transactions such as data request on the network. The nodes in the
network are responsible for validating and issuing the transac-
tions. If a new vehicle enters the network and issues a transaction
then it must be directly or indirectly approved by the previous
two transactions. After verification, the transaction can be added
in the network and repeated addition of transactions results into
a DAG like structure called the tangle. There is a start transaction
or the first transaction in the network that is directly or indirectly
approved by all the other transactions. The first transaction
is responsible for creating the tangle graph that contains all
the IOTA tokens. IOTA tokens are the specific cryptocurrency
used in IOTA to perform seamless and immediate transactions
between the nodes. Every time a transaction is added in the

NOTATION SUMMARY
network it has to be validated by the previous two transactions
and therefore there is no need to do any complicated puzzle
solving to choose the miner. This is how the IOTA decreases the
computational dependency as compared to blockchain.
D. Consensus Finality
Consensus is a sort of agreement for the validity of a trans-
action among the nodes in a distributed ledger [39], [40]. Con-
sensus finality is referred to as a final agreement among all the
network nodes. Blockchain never reaches to consensus finality
due to the issues of forking and pruning. In generic blockchain
network, where proof-of-work consensus is followed, different
miners parallely work to mine a block. Whichever miner is able
to present a successfully mined block in less time wins the
competition and his block is accepted in the main chain. There
are various instances when two or more miners simultaneously
present a new block. In such cases, both the successfully mined
blocks are accepted as two forks of the main chain. Gradually as
the chain increases, one of the block becomes the part of longest
chain and the other fork has to be pruned. The transaction that
has reached consensus at one point of time, might be pruned
in due course. Therefore, a stage of consensus finality is never
reached, as the risk of pruning is always there [41].
The concept of weight associated with each node is used
in IOTA network to eventually reach consensus finality. The
weight of the node in the tangle is proportional to the amount
of work that the issuing node invested into it. The value of the
weight of the transaction is a multiple of three. The importance
of the transaction is decided on the basis of weight associated
with the transaction. The transactions with a higher weight are
more important to be present in the network and vice-versa. To
avoid any type of attacks and spam in the network it is assumed
that in a short period of time any new node cannot create large
number of transactions having a high weight value. The weight
of the transactions gradually increases as and when the new
transactions are verified by other existing transactions. Increased
weight directly states that the transaction is more authentic. The
IOTA tangle follows this process for reaching consensus without
a transaction or mining fees as compared to the bitcoin consensus
where the miners charge a fees to mine a block or validate a
transaction. The cumulative weight of a transaction is the sum
of the weights of the particular transaction and the weight of the
transactions that validated it directly or indirectly as shown in
Eqn. (3).

IV. PROPOSED OPTIMAL PRICE FORMULATION
A game theoretic approach is used to find the computation
cost between vehicle to vehicle and vehicle to RSU. The price
is assumed to be the computation power used by the vehicle to
get the requested data such as the GPS location of other vehicle.
Location is transferred from the vehicle to the RSU and further
to the requesting vehicle from the RSU. The game theory is used
to calculate the solution that involves minimum computation by
the requesting vehicle. The requesting vehicle can get the data
either from the RSU or directly from the nearby vehicle.
The game theoretic model is divided into two parts. The first
part includes the division of bandwidth from the RSU to multiple
vehicles in the range of RSU. The RSU will provide different
bandwidth to different vehicles in its range based on the price
offered by vehicles requesting the data. Auction based game
theoretic approach is used here to allocate the bandwidth to
multiple vehicles. Here RSU and the requesting vehicles act
as auctioneer and bidders respectively.
The second part of the model comes into play when the RSU
carrying the required data is out of the range of requesting vehi-
cle. In such a case, the RSU transmits the requested data in form
of packets to the vehicles in its range, which in turn transmits the
packets to the requesting vehicle. This part of the game theoretic
model includes the Nash bargaining process among multiple
vehicles. The requesting vehicle checks for the vehicle having
maximum information or the packets with highest weight and
gets associated with that vehicle. The Nash bargaining approach
helps the requesting vehicle to get the maximum requested data
in least computation cost. The following two sub sections explain
these two parts of the model in detail.
A. Game Theory Model for Bandwidth Auction
Between Vehicles and RSU
In this model, we assume that at some location there are
multiple vehicles and a single RSU. RSU is connected to the

internet to collect the useful information requested by the vehi-
cles. Vehicles can request the RSU for any information such as
traffic data, whether information data, GPS data of other vehicles
or some multimedia data. The maximum bandwidth that the
RSU can provide to the vehicles is limited. Therefore, get the
data from RSU with maximum bandwidth or in minimum time
there is a conflict among the vehicles as shown in Fig. 3. To
solve this conflict between the vehicle to RSU communication,
a game theoretic auction based mechanism is proposed. In
this mechanism, auctioneers are the RSU and bidders are the
vehicles.
Let us consider one RSU that is connected with the internet.
When vehicles comes in the coverage area of RSU and request
for data, then the bandwidth of RSU has to be divided among
N number of vehicle. Total Bandwidth at RSU is denoted as B.
First of all, the bidders submit their bids i.e., βi as shown in Eqn.
(4). The bid includes the requested bandwidth and the offered
price. Here ωi denotes the bandwidth requested by the vehicle
i and �i denotes the price offered by that vehicle to download
the requested data. Please note that the requested bandwidth
should always be less than the total bandwidth with the RSU
(i.e., ωi < B). After collecting the bids from all N vehicles, the
amount of bandwidth allocated to each vehicle is Ωi as shown
in Eqn. (6). Here Γ is the summation of the prices offered by all
the vehicles as shown in Eqn. (5) and B is the total bandwidth of
the RSU. So the allocation of bandwidth is calculated based on
the values of requested bandwidth and offered price as shown in
Eqn. (6).
βi = (ωi, �i) (4)
Γ =
N∑
i=1
�i (5)
Ωi = min
(

)
, ∀ ωi < B (6)
The bandwidth allocated to the vehicles by the RSU is not
only dependent on the individual bid of the requesting vehicles
but also depends on the bid from other vehicles. Each vehicle
wants to optimize its bid to minimize the price and maximize
its QoE in terms of allocated bandwidth. Based on the above
information, non cooperative game (Auction based) is proposed
to provide maximum possible bandwidth to the participating
vehicles in minimum possible price. To minimize the price and
maximize the bandwidth, we defile a QoE function Ei for the
ith vehicle as follows [42].
Ei(�i, �−i) = φi (Ωi(β))− Λi (Ωi(β), �i) (7)
Here �−i denotes the vector of bidding prices of all vehicles
other than vehicle i. The QoE is calculated as the difference
between valuation and cost, where cost Λi is the product of the
allocated bandwidth and price and the valuation is defined as the
time interval during which the vehicle is in or out of the range of
RSU. The valuation of a vehicle is calculated as the summation
of time-in i.e., τi in which the vehicle is within the range of RSU
and τo during which the vehicle is out of the range of RSU. The
following equations are used to calculate the cost and valuation.
Λi (Ωi(β), �i) = Ωi�i (8)
φi (Ωi(β)) = τiκ log (1 + ξΩi) + η(τo) (9)
where κ and ξ are logarithmic constants. The user satisfaction
or η is defined as a function of time interval in which vehicle is
not able to fetch the data from RSU. The following equation is
used to calculate the value of user satisfaction.
η (τo) = 1 − 1
1 + exp (−μ (τo − ε))
(10)
where μ and ε are constants. The best response of vehicle i is
calculated as shown in the following equation.
ρi(�i) = argmax
�i
Ei(�i) (11)
where ρi is the best response of vehicle i. The Nash equilibrium
is given as follows.
�∗i = ρi
(
�∗−i
)
(12)
The Nash Equilibrium gives the appropriate values of price
that deliver the maximum QoE to each vehicle.
In Algorithm 1, first the bid price of all vehicles in the RSU
network is taken as the input. The bid price is taken in terms of
required bandwidth and offered price per unit to download the
data. Output of the algorithm is the price at which vehicles can
get the maximum QoE. To get this, the values of bandwidth
ω, cost Λ, valuation φ, user satisfaction η, and QoE E are
calculated for all the vehicles and finally the price � is declared
at which the vehicles can get the maximum QoE E.
B. Game Theory Model for Bandwidth Auction
Between Vehicles
In this model the requesting vehicle is assumed to be out of the
range of serving RSU. The RSU divides the requested data into
multiple packets. These packets are send to number of vehicle
in the network of RSU. The requesting vehicle is allowed to
access the data from multiple vehicles as they come in the range
of requesting vehicle. It can improve both speed and reliability
and thereby the cost of offloading.
We take a situation as shown in Fig. 4 where RSU in lane A
wants to send the data to the vehicle in lane B. Let us assume
that the size of data file is too large and the vehicle in lane B

is not in the range of the RSU in lane A. Therefore, the RSU
cannot send the data to the vehicle directly as the case discussed
in Section IV-A. Therefore, the RSU sends the data in form
of packets to the vehicle in the lane B via other vehicles. The
RSU in lane A transmits the data to vehicles in same lane and
these vehicles in both lanes exchange the data among themselves
when they cross each other. In this manner the data is exchanged
between vehicles. The data is divided into L packets having
same size, and the requesting vehicle needs all the data packets.
Each packet is denoted with some weight Υ(L). The number of
packets n that can be transmitted between vehicles within time
χ0 is defined as follows.

Δi =

Υi(L) (14)
where Δi is the utility, κi is the packet being shared between
two vehicles and Υi is the weight of that particular packet. The
utility function can also be considered as the vehicle satisfaction
parameter.
The objective function is to maximize the utility between the
requesting vehicle i.e., i and the vehicle carrying requested data
i.e., j. We define an objective function ϕ which is defined as the
mutual benefit which vehicle i and j gain from the bargaining,
and it is expressed as follows.

where L1 and L2 are packets of vehicle i and j respectively and
Ψi,j is the number of packets that can be transmitted within time
period χ0. ϕ is function that define that how both vehicle can
get benefits from bargaining. The constraint specified in Eqn. 16
specifies that the data packets with the servicing vehicle imust be
different from the requesting vehicle j. If the requesting vehicle
already has all the packets carried by the servicing vehicle then
there would be no benefit in data transmission between these
two vehicles.
For bargaining we adopt Nash bargaining solution. In Nash
bargaining algorithmϑ is feasible region,Δ is the utility after the
bargaining and Δo is utility before the data transfer between ve-
hicles. ϕ(ϑ,Δo) is the Nash bargaining solution that maximizes
the utility of both vehicles.

The algorithm for information transfer between vehicles is

Among all vehicles in the range, the data is exchanged with the

number of packets that are can be transmitted between vehicle i
and j in time χ0 as Ψi,j . When the vehicles are connected, each
vehicle transfers information of weight of data and summary of
data packet to other vehicles. The bargaining algorithm 3 is run
between the vehicles to search for the best possible association.
The data transfer is done based on the results of the bargaining
algorithm until both the vehicles have same data packets. The
steps for the data transfer are also explained in Algorithm 2.
V. NUMERICAL ANALYSIS
A. Simulation Settings
Consider a distributed network of V2V and vehicle to RSU.
For the evaluation of vehicle to RSU model, we have consid-
ered four vehicles having different time-in and time-out in the
network. Time-out of vehicle is calculated as difference of total
time and time-in of vehicle. The time-in of vehicles is assumed
to be in the range of [10, 50] minutes in the frame window of 60
minutes. The required bandwidth of four vehicles while entering
in the network is assumed to be ωi = {6, 12, 18, 24} bits per
second and the corresponding price of each vehicle is taken
as �i = {30, 40, 50, 60} cents. For every iteration, we increase
the number of vehicles in the network and consider the change
in QoE of the four vehicles under consideration. Finally, each
vehicle is allocated its required bandwidth at minimum price
having maximum QoE. It is assumed that the RSU can provide
bandwidth to more then one vehicle simultaneously, hence if
multiple vehicles are assigned to one RSU then all can get the
required bandwidth. In the model of V2V communication we
have considered three vehicles. Number of packets transferred
between two vehicles are L = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and on the basis of
proposed model, the utility between the vehicles is calculated.
One vehicle calculates the utility with two other vehicles and
decides to get the information from one having a higher utility.
B. Performance Evaluation
Fig. 5 shows that the allocation of bandwidth by RSU to
vehicle 1 is varying as the bid price by vehicle increases or the
Fig. 5. Variation in allocated bandwidth based on bid price and network size.

Fig. 7. Variation in QoE with increase in network size.
number of vehicles in the network increase. It can be observed
that with the increasing of the number of vehicle in the network,
the allocation of bandwidth to vehicle 1 is decreasing and when
bid price of vehicle 1 is increasing the allocation of bandwidth is
also increasing. The values on the colour map indicate the change
in the values of the allocated bandwidth. The dark blue colour
indicates the minimum value of allocated bandwidth and the
dark orange colour indicates the maximum value of the allocated
bandwidth.
Fig. 6 shows that with the with the increase in the number
of vehicles in the network, allocation of bandwidth to different
vehicles by the RSU decreases. This is so because the bandwidth
at RSU is fixed and is divided among the vehicles that are in the
network of RSU.
Similarly, Fig. 7 shows the effect on the QoE of vehicles as
the network size is changing. The QoE not only depends on the

time in which the vehicle was in the range of RSU, valuation and
cost but it also depends on the size of the network i.e., number
of vehicles in the range of RSU. As the number of vehicles
increases the QoE of vehicle decreases. It can be observed that
theQoE is sometimes increasing in between in Fig. 7. This is so,
because theQoE parameter is dependent on multiple parameters
as discussed above and the decisions taken by other vehicles
effects the QoE of one vehicle.
Fig. 8 shows the variation of the vehicle QoE with the change
in the bid values by the vehicles. As the vehicles go on increasing
the bid amount, the allocated bandwidth foes on increasing and
hence the QoE. We assume that the requested bandwidth by
each vehicle is fixed. The QoE will increase with increasing
the bid price only till the allocated bandwidth is less than or
equal to the requested bandwidth. As soon as the requested
bandwidth becomes equal to the allocated bandwidth, the QoE
decreases with increase on bid price. This is so, because the user
is already getting the maximum requested bandwidth and there is
no benefit of further increasing the price. It can be observed that
for vehicle 2 and 4 in Fig. 8 the allocated bandwidth becomes
equal to the requested bandwidth at iteration 4 and thereafter the
QoE value is declining if the bid price is increased.
Fig. 9 shows the comparison of the proposed model in terms
of vehicleQoE with the first bid mechanism. In proposed model
vehicles increase the bid value over iterations to get the required
Fig. 10. variation in QoE with change in bid price and fixed bandwidth
requirement.

and 3.
amount of bandwidth and high QoE. It can be observed that the
QoE of all the vehicles is comparatively higher in the proposed
model as compared to the first bid auction model.
Fig. 10 shows variation in QoE due to variation in amount
of bandwidth required and bid price. As the bid price increases,
QoE of vehicles increases or decreases depending on the bids of
other vehicles. This is so, because the QoE of vehicles depends
on the bid decision taken by all the vehicles in the network.
At some point, vehicles get the highest QoE depending on
the required bandwidth. After this point even if the vehicle
chooses to increase the bid price, the allocated bandwidth does
not increase and therefore the value of QoE decreases.
Fig. 11 shows the utility comparison of exchange of packets
between vehicle 1 and 2 or between vehicle 1 and 3. The utility
of exchange between vehicle 1 and 3 is high as compared to
vehicle 1 and 2. Therefore, vehicle 1 decides to communicate
and exchange packets with vehicle 3 instead of vehicle 2. Here,
utility refers to gathering maximum amount of data in minimum
number of communications.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed two models 1) vehicle to
RSU auction based model 2) vehicle to vehicle nash bargaining
model. IOTA consensus algorithm is used to reach to a consensus
in the vehicular network. The auction based model is used
to allocate the required amount of bandwidth with maximum

quality of experience (QoE). The Nash bargaining algorithm is
used to get associated with the vehicle with maximum utility.
The simulations results prove that the proposed algorithms to
maximize QoE and utility of every vehicle in network are better
than its counterparts.
