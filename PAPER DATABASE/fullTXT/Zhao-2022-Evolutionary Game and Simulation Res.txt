Recently, with the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, emergency supply allocation system is drawing more and more social at-
tention. Emergency supply allocation system is an important part of emergency governance system. It reflects social organizations’
credibility, public safety, and the modernization level of social governance. However, emergency supply allocation system still has
some problems, such as information asymmetry, different desires of participants, unreasonable allocation, and so on. At present, it
is widely accepted that the advantage of blockchain in co-governance could be of great help in solving above problems. And in
order to distinguish the effect of blockchain to the emergency supply allocation, the paper builds a tripartite evolutionary game
model among the government, social organizations, and the public to analyse the impact of blockchain platform on emergency
supply allocation.-e simulation analysis shows the following: (1)-e strategy choices of the government have a crucial impact on
the evolution and stability of social organizations’ strategies. It needs a long-term process to guide social organizations practicing
active allocation, and the government should accelerate to build the blockchain platform to promote this process. (2) With the
help of blockchain platform, the increment of penalty intensity of the government is conductive to increasing the probabilities that
social organizations practice active allocation and the government practices strict supervision. (3) Blockchain platform has a
significant impact on social organizations’ choice for active allocation in many aspects, such as the positive and negative effects of
social organizations, effect’s increasing multiple, and the cost of the public informing. In the end, some suggestions are presented
to improve the co-governance of emergency supply allocation.
1. Introduction
Emergency supply allocation is a significant part of emer-
gency management system [1]. However, the emergency
supply allocation still has problems at present; for example,
in the early control of COVID-19, the improper allocation of
supplies due to poor data collection and sharing led to
serious crisis of confidence; patients were unable to obtain
essential emergency supplies due to poor coordination
among different departments [2]. -e assessment of the
status of emergency management collaboration by the
United Nations and Economic and Social Commission for
Asia and the Pacific indicated that it is necessary to improve
the level of collaboration at all levels [3]. It can be seen that,
in the emergency supply allocation, scientific allocation is
the key, and the collaborative participation among the
government, social organizations, and the public is the
trend. -erefore, to improve emergency supply allocation, it
is necessary to research the promotion effect of information
technology and decision strategies of participants co-gov-
ernance on emergency allocation.
With the rapid evolution of the new round technology
revolution, technological innovation plays an important role
in promoting the optimization of social governance
mechanisms and upgrading of social governance model, and
at the same time, technological innovation is becoming an
important driving force for the innovation of emergency
management. In this background, with the development of

blockchain, many studies showed that blockchain had the
features of collaborative consensus, traceability, and im-
mutability of information [4–8], and it played an important
role in the innovation of emergency management. Recently,
researchers begun to study the improvement of emergency
management with the help of blockchain. Yao and Xue [9]
summarized the applications of blockchain in emergency
management and found that the blockchain had great ap-
plication values in the realms of emergency information
transmission, emergency prevention and control early
warning, and emergency charitable donation. Hu et al. [10]
used blockchain to construct emergency information system
and realized the storage integrity, distributed sharing, and
information’s traceability. Wang [1] designed a blockchain
platform architecture, organizational structure, and opera-
tion mode for social donations of emergency supplies,
aiming to solve the problem of information asymmetry.
Deng et al. [11] made use of blockchain to build an
emergency logistics system and realized traceability and
anticounterfeiting of emergency supplies, automatic
matching of supply and demand, and whole-process
monitoring of distribution. Wu et al. [12] also demonstrated
the application prospect of blockchain in promoting
emergency logistics to achieve efficient guarantee, trust
governance, and intelligent operation from the perspective
of epidemic material security’s prevention and control by
combining theory analysis with application cases. In addi-
tion, some institutes and companies constructed informa-
tion exchange platforms for emergency supplies and
emergency donation based on blockchain. For example,
BitGive, BitNation, Start Network, and other international
organizations established relevant blockchain platforms to
manage funds and supplies from social donations after
emergencies [13]. -ese platforms have played a key role in
the information collection on supply and demand of
emergency supplies and reliable traceability of supplies [9].
From above, it can be seen that people have gradually no-
ticed the importance of blockchain to emergency
management.
In emergency management, different requirements of
participants will influence the choice of their strategies, and
the dynamic adjustment of strategies is suitable to be studied
by evolutionary game theory [14]. -erefore, many re-
searchers used evolutionary game method to study emer-
gency management recently. As a whole, the game study of
emergency management mainly includes cross-regional
governance, emergency reserve mechanism, information
exchange, and dissemination mechanism. Xiao et al. [15]
used the analysis framework of regional evolutionary game
to study the cross-regional governance of emergencies and
found that when the regional spill-over effect and gover-
nance cost are small or the economic and social losses caused
by emergencies are large, all regions will choose co-gover-
nance. Pi [16] discussed the mechanism construction of the
national medical emergency supply reserve system with the
combination of government and enterprise based on evo-
lutionary game and proposed to give full play to the role of
financial incentives in guiding enterprises to participate. Xu
et al. [17] took SARS as a background and analysed the
mechanisms of information communication by using evo-
lutionary game theory. -ey found that the measures taken
by the government to disclose information are conducive to
restraining the spreading trend of emergencies. Deng et al.
[18] further constructed a tripartite evolutionary game
model among producers, transmitters, and decomposers of
information and analysed the stability strategy. -ey found
that information quality and punishment intensity of in-
formation producers are key factors affecting the dissemi-
nation of online public opinion information under
emergencies. Xu et al. [19] constructed and analysed the
tripartite evolutionary game model among the government,
enterprises, and the public to deal with emergencies.
-rough model construction and simulation analysis, they
found that the government can promote tripartite cooper-
ation to fight the emergency by strengthening supervision,
formulating reasonable reward and punishment mecha-
nisms, and encouraging public participation.
From the above literature review, it can be seen that
blockchain can promote the innovation of emergency
management, and evolutionary game theory is an important
grasp to analyse the strategies of participants in co-gover-
nance of emergence, and more and more researchers pro-
posed solutions from the above aspects, respectively.
However, there is little research developed by using evo-
lutionary game theory to analyse emergency management
based on blockchain, especially in the scenario of emergency
supply allocation.
-erefore, based on the assumption of bounded ratio-
nality, this paper develops evolutionary game research on
the co-governance of emergency supply allocation based on
blockchain. -e main contributions of this paper are as
follows: (1) -is paper introduces tripartite participants,
namely, the government, social organizations, and the public
into evolutionary game, which is different from the relevant
literates [14, 20]. (2) Analysing the advantage and mecha-
nism of blockchain promoting emergency supply allocation.
(3) Analysing the stability of tripartite evolutionary game
and researching the impact of blockchain on emergency
supply allocation. (4) Using simulation to verify the validity
of evolutionary game analysis and giving the suggestions to
promote the co-governance of emergency supply allocation.
2. Mechanism of Blockchain to Emergency
Supply Allocation
Emergency supply allocation has the following require-
ments: First, the complexity of the emergency events brings
about the requirement of decentralize governance. Second,
multipart participation of emergency supply allocation
brings about the requirement of information sharing and
multiparticipant collaboration. And finally, the motivating
multiparticipant taking part in emergency supply allocation
brings about the requirement of traceability.
Fortunately, with the development of blockchain tech-
nology, many studies showed that the openness, distributed
storage, traceability, and other features of blockchain could
meet the above requirements, promoting the modernization
of emergency supply allocation system and capability. First,
2 Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society
the blockchain platform is open to all authorized partici-
pants and they can store and read all kinds of information
about emergency supply allocation, which can meet the
requirement of decentralize governance and improve the
public’s trust in social organizations. Second, blockchain
adopts distributed accounting method to realize real-time
sharing data between multiple subjects, which meets the
need of emergency supply allocation information sharing
and multiparticipant collaboration. -ird, the timestamp
technology of blockchain achieves data tamper-proofing and
traceability. It provides support for the government and the
public to monitor the source and destination of emergency
supplies and to hold those who are involved responsible,
which meets the requirement of information traceability
[21]. -e mechanism of blockchain to emergency supply
allocation is shown in Figure 1.
3. Game Analysis of Emergency Supply
Allocation Based on Blockchain
3.1. Basic Assumptions of Game Model. -is paper focuses
on the strategic interaction among the government, social
organizations, and the public during the emergency supply
allocation, by modelling a tripartite evolutionary game. -e
three subjects follow the basic assumptions of bounded
rationality and information asymmetry.-eir choices will be
influenced by other participants, and they will purse max-
imum profits by adjusting their strategies. -erefore, the
following hypothesis are proposed.
Hypothesis 1. Strategic Space of Participants. As the su-
pervisor, the government tends to invest a lot of human and
material resources to construct information platform based
on blockchain and implement strict supervision on social
organizations. However, the construction of information
platform and strict supervision will greatly increase the
government’s expenditure, and based on the consideration
of short-term interests and responsibility avoidance, the
government maybe practice relaxing supervision on social
organizations. -erefore, the strategy space of the govern-
ment is (strict supervision, relaxing supervision).
As the bridge connecting the supply and requisitioning
parts of emergency supply allocation, social organizations
tend to actively allocate emergency supplies to establish a
good social image. However, for the reasons of poor pro-
fessional ability, the higher cost of allocation or the lighter
penalties, social organizations maybe passively allocate
emergency supplies or practice jobbery to pursue the higher
profits. -erefore, the strategy space of the social organi-
zations is (active allocation, passive allocation).
Facing the passive allocation of social organizations, on
one hand, the public may choose to inform against social
organizations to protect their own benefits; on the other
hand, the public may choose tolerance for the reasons of
high cost of informing. -erefore, the strategy space of the
public is (informing, tolerance).
Hypothesis 2. /e Probability Parameters of the Participants’
Strategies. -e probability of social organizations’ active
allocation is x(0≤ x≤ 1), and the passive allocation is 1 − x;
the probability of the public’s informing is y(0≤y≤ 1), and
the tolerance is 1 − y; the probability of the government’s
strict supervision is z(0≤ z≤ 1), and the relaxing supervi-
sion is 1 − z. In addition, x, y, z are all functions of time t.
Hypothesis 3. /e Parameters of the Government. For the
government, the cost of strict supervision is defined by Cy,
which includes the expenses of constructing and main-
taining blockchain platform and the expenses of daily
supervision. Once the government receives information
against passive allocation of social organizations and ver-
ifies it, the government will fine social organizations with
Fa and award the informant with Fe. And in the situation of
strict supervision, the government will achieve positive
effect Rg.
To the government, the cost of relaxing supervision is
defined by 0. And the negative effect caused by relaxing
supervision is defined by Ng, which includes poor emer-
gency management, damage of the public safety, and loss of
credibility. In addition, the government will cost Cn to
coordinate the emergency supplies and maintain social
stability, in the condition that the social organizations
practice passive allocation.
Hypothesis 4. /e Parameters of Social Organizations. -e
profit of social organizations’ normal operation is Ya. -e
cost of social organizations’ active allocation is Ca; the
positive effect caused by active allocation is Rn. -e cost of
social organizations’ passive allocation is Cp, and
Ca >Cp > 0. If social organizations passively allocate
emergency supplies or practice jobbery, they will achieve
extra profits Yp, which will cause negative effect Nn. In
addition, when the government uses blockchain platform
to strengthen supervision, Nn and Rn will both increase for
the reason of the great enhancement of information
transparency, and the coefficient of increment is defined by
λ (λ≥ 1).
Hypothesis 5. /e Parameters of the Public. If social orga-
nizations actively allocate emergency supplies, the public
will receive emergency supplies timely, and the positive
effect is defined by Rp. If the public informs against social
organizations maliciously, the government will fine the
public with Rn under the strict supervision.
On the contrary, if the social organizations passively
allocate emergency supplies, the public will not receive
emergency supplies in time, and the negative effect is defined
by Np. -e cost of the public informing against social or-
ganizations is defined by Cr. And if social organizations
correct the behaviour of passive allocation, the public will
achieve additional effect Up. In addition, in the situation of
strict supervision, the government will award the informants
with Fe.
3.2. /e Payoff Matrix. Based on above assumptions, the
payoff matrix including various strategies of the

government, social organizations, and the public is con-
structed, as shown in Table 1.

According to the stability theorem of differential
equations, if the probability that social organizations choose
active allocation is in a stable state, it must meet the con-
ditions that F(x) � 0 and F′(x)< 0. And letting F(x) � 0,
we can get x � 0, x � 1, z � Ca − Cp−
Rn − Nn + Yp/(λ − 1)(Rn + Nn) + Fa � z∗. When z � z∗,
we can get F(x) ≡ 0, any value of x is the evolutionary stable
strategy of social organizations, and the strategy of social
organizations does not change over time. When z≠ z∗, there
will be two situations:

(1) When z> z∗, we can get F’(0)> 0, F’(1)< 0. -us,
x � 1 is the steady state.
(2) When z< z∗, we can get F’(0)< 0, F’(1)> 0. -us,
x � 0 is the steady state. Figure 2 shows the phase
diagram of social organizations’ strategy evolution.
Proposition 1. /e probability that social organizations
choose the strategy of “active allocation” is positively related to
positive and negative effects, the effect’s increasing multiple
and the government penalty intensity, and is negatively re-
lated to the cost saved by negative allocation and extra profits.
Proof. It can be seen from Figure 2 that the probabilities of
social organizations adopting the strategies of “active allo-
cation” and “negative allocation” are the volumes of A1 and
A2, respectively, calculated as
VA1

(λ − 1) Rn + Nn( 􏼁 + Fa

. (3)
According to the expression of VA1
when social orga-
nizations choose “active allocation,” the first-order partial
derivative of each element can be obtained:
zVA1
/z(Rn + Nn)> 0, zVA1
/zλ> 0, zVA1
/zFa > 0,
zVA1
/(Ca − Cp)< 0, zVA1
/Yp < 0. -erefore, increasing
positive and negative effects, the effect’s increasing multiple
and the government penalty intensity, or decreasing the cost
saved by negative allocation and extra profits can all increase
the probability of social organizations choosing “active
allocation.” □
Proposition 2. In the process of evolution, the probability
that social organizations choose the strategy of “active allo-
cation” is positively related to the probability that the gov-
ernment chooses “strict supervision.”
Proof. According to the stability analysis of social organi-
zations, when z< z∗, we can get F′(0)< 0; thus, x � 0 is the
steady state; otherwise, x � 1 is the steady state.
-erefore, with the increase of z, the probability that
social organizations choose the strategy of “active allocation”
will be increased from x � 0 to x � 1. It can be seen that
through constructing the blockchain platform by the gov-
ernment to strengthen supervision, social organizations can
effectively allocate emergency supplies. □

profits of the public in “informing” and “tolerance” are U21

According to the stability theorem of differential
equations, if the probability that the public chooses to in-
form is stable, it must meet the conditions that F(y) � 0 and
F′(y)< 0. Let F(y) � 0, we can get y � 0, y � 1,
x � zFe − Cr/2zFe + Rp � x∗. When x � x∗, we can get
F(y) ≡ 0; any value of y is the evolutionary stable strategy of
the public, and the strategy of the public does not change
over time. When x≠ x∗, there will be two situations:
(1) When x>x∗, we can get F’(0)< 0, F’(1)> 0. -us,
y � 0 is the steady state.
(2) When x<x∗, we can get F’(0)> 0, F’(1)< 0. -us,
y � 1 is the steady state. Figure 3 shows the phase
diagram of the public’s strategy evolution.
Proposition 3. /e probability that the public chooses the
“informing” strategy is positively related to the informants’
award, and it is negatively related to the cost of the public
informing and the positive effect brought to the public by
social organizations’ active allocation supplies.
Proof. Figure 3 shows that the probabilities that the public
adopts the strategies of “informing” and “tolerance” are the
volumes of B1 and B2, respectively, calculated as

According to the expression of VB1
, when the public
adopts the strategy of “informing,” the first-order partial
derivative of each element can be obtained: zVB1
/zFe > 0,
zVB1
/zCr < 0, zVB1
/zRp < 0. -erefore, increasing the in-
formants’ award or decreasing the cost of the public
informing can all increase the probability of the public
choosing “informing.” In addition, when the positive effect
brought to the public by social organizations’ active allo-
cation supplies exceeds a certain limit, the public’s psy-
chological endurance will be greatly improved. -us, when
the negative effect brought by social organizations’ passive
allocation supplies is far below the acceptance boundary
[22], the probability of public informing will be reduced
accordingly. □
Proposition 4. In the process of evolution, the probability
that the public chooses the strategy of “informing” is positively
related to the probability that the government chooses “strict
supervision.” However, it is negatively related to the proba-
bility that social organizations choose “active allocation.”
Proof. According to the stability analysis of the public,
when x> x∗ and z<xRp + Cr/(1 − 2x)Fe, we can get
F′(0)< 0; thus, y � 0 is the steady state; otherwise, y � 1 is
the steady state. -us, as x decreases or z increases, the
probability of public informing will be increased from y � 0
to y � 1.
-erefore, in order to improve the enthusiasm of the
public to participate in emergency supply allocation man-
agement, the government should strengthen supervision and
create an open and transparent environment for the public
to safeguard their rights with the help of emergency supply
allocation information exchanging platform based on
blockchain. In addition, as social organizations become
more conscious of active allocation under strict supervision,
the public can gain the highest benefits by choosing
tolerance. □

pose the expected profits of the government choosing “strict

According to the stability theorem of differential
equations, if the probability that the government chooses
strict supervision is in a stable state, it must meet the
conditions that F(z) � 0 and F′(z)< 0. Letting F(z) � 0, we
can get z � 0, z � 1, y � (1 − x)(Rg + Ng + Fa)−
Cy/(1 − 2x)Fe � y∗. When y � y∗, F(z) ≡ 0, any value of z
is the evolutionary stable strategy of the government, and the
strategy of the government does not change over time.When
y≠y∗, there will be two situations:
(1) When y>y∗, we can get F’(0)< 0, F’(1)> 0. -us,

(2) When y<y∗, we can get F’(0)> 0, F’(1)< 0. -us,
z � 1 is the steady state. Figure 4 shows the phase
diagram of the government’s strategy evolution.
Proposition 5. /e probability that the government chooses
the “strict supervision” strategy is positively related to the fines
imposed on social organizations and the positive and negative
effects of the government and it is negatively related to the
award for informants.

fore, increasing the fines imposed on social organizations
and the positive and negative effects of the government or
decreasing the rewards for informants can all prompt the
government to practice strict supervision. □
Proposition 6. In the evolution process, the probability that
the government chooses the strategy of “strict supervision” is
negatively related to the probability that the social organi-
zations choose “active allocation” and the probability that the
public chooses “informing.”
Proof. -e proving process is the same as Proposition 4.
-erefore, when the probability that the social organi-
zations choose “active allocation” and the probability that
the public chooses “informing” is high, the government will
reduce the probability of strict supervision, which is easy to
lead to the lack of supervision. □

4.2. StabilityAnalysis of Tripartite EvolutionaryGame System.
In order to carry out the analysis of the evolutionary stable
strategies under the mutual interaction among social or-
ganizations, the public, and the government, we first build a
tripartite dynamic replication system for emergency supply
allocation according to equations (2), (6), and (10).

Letting F(x) � F(y) � F(z) � 0, we can get 8 equilib-
rium points of the dynamic system: E1(0, 0, 0), E2(1, 0, 0),
E3(0, 0, 1), E4(0, 1, 1), E5(0, 1, 0), E6(1, 1, 0), E7(1, 0, 1), and
E8(1, 1, 1). According to the replication dynamic equation in
the tripartite game, a Jacobian matrix can be obtained:

8 Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society
Inputting E1 ∼ E8 into Jacobian matrix J, we can get the
eigenvalues corresponding to each equilibrium point, as
shown in Table 2.
According to the point of Friedman [23], when the ei-
genvalues of Jacobian matrix J are all negative, the equi-
librium point is the asymptotic stable point of the system. It
can be seen from Table 2 that the equilibrium points E5, E6,
E7, and E8 all have positive eigenvalues, so they cannot be
evolutionary stability strategies. Equilibrium points E1 ∼ E4
are evolutionary stability strategies if the stability conditions
in Table 3 are satisfied.
Scenario 1. When Ca − Cp + Yp > Rn + Nn and Cy − Fa >
Rg + Ng, that is, when the extra profits obtained from social
organizations’ passive allocation are higher than the sum of
positive and negative effects under relaxing supervision, as
well as when the extra cost of the government’ supervision
(i.e., the cost of the government’s strict supervision minus
the fines the government carries on to social organizations)
is higher than the sum of positive and negative effects, as
shown in Table 3, there is only one stable point E1(0, 0, 0) in
the dynamic replication system.
-is means that it is expensive for the government to
construct the blockchain platform for strict supervision, and
for the sake of maximizing the benefits, the government will
choose relaxing supervision. In this case, the lack of the
government supervision will make it difficult for the
blockchain to play a role, which will cause the problems of
information asymmetry and information isolated island [22]
and further cause social organizations to allocate passively in
order to achieve extra profits. In addition, without the
blockchain platform, the cost for the public to collect
information and inform against the passive allocation of
social organizations will greatly increase, and it will be more
difficult to protect their rights. -erefore, the public tends to
be tolerant.
Scenario 2. When Ca − Cp + Yp <Rn + Nn, that is, when the
extra profits of social organizations’ passive allocation of
supplies are less than the sum of positive and negative effects
under relaxing supervision, as shown in Table 3, there is only
one stable point E2(1, 0, 0) in the dynamic replication
system. -is equilibrium means that when social organi-
zations obtain little benefit in passive allocation, they do not
want to take risks to practice passive allocation. And at the
same time, the government do not want to construct
blockchain platform to optimize emergency supply alloca-
tion for the sake of the cost. In this case, the government’s
strategy is relaxing supervision, and the public’s strategy is
tolerance.
Scenario 3. When Ca − Cp + Yp > λ(Rn + Nn) + Fa, that is,
when the extra profits obtained from social organizations’
passive allocation are higher than the sum of positive and
negative effects under strict supervision, as shown in Table 3,
the stable point may be E3(0, 0, 1) or E4(0, 1, 1), which
means that no matter how the government and the public
make strategy choices, social organizations will still choose
passive allocation in order to seek high profits. On this basis,
only when Cr <Fe and Cy − Fa <Rg + Ng − Fe, that is, only
when the cost of the public’s informing is lower than the
reward for informing, and the extra cost of strict supervision
by the government is low, there will be only one stable point
E4(0, 1, 1) in the dynamic replication system, which means

the government and the public will stabilize their strategy
choices on strict supervision and informing against social
organizations respectively. In this case, even if government
practices strict supervision with the help of blockchain
platform and punishes social organizations for their passive
allocation, social organizations still choose passive allocation
in order to seek high profits.
In summary, the co-governance of emergency supply
allocation can be divided into three stages: the ineffective
stage, the intermediate stage, and the useless stage. -e
ineffective stage corresponds to Scenario 3, and in this case,
no matter whether the government practices strict super-
vision with the help of blockchain platform, social organi-
zations will choose passive allocation as the optimum
strategy, and the emergency supply allocation management
system is extremely deteriorating. -e useless stage corre-
sponds to Scenario 2, and in this case, social organizations
will practice active allocation, and the government’s
blockchain platform will be useless. -e emergency supply
allocation management system is in a complete stage. -e
intermediate stage is the transition from the ineffective stage
to the useless stage. At this stage, there are few evolutionary
stable points in the system, and the strategies of social or-
ganizations are constantly adjusted according to the strat-
egies of the public and the government. -erefore, it is
necessary to build the blockchain platform to promote the
optimization and adjustment of relevant parameters and
realize the co-governance of emergency supply allocation
from ineffective stage to useless stage [24].
5. Simulation Analysis
In order to observe the stable equilibrium strategies of
tripartite participants and their sensitivity to parameters in
evolutionary game, and verify the validity of the stability
analysis, we use MATLAB R2021a to simulate the game.
Define Rn � 4, Nn � 4, Cp � 3, Ca � 6, Yp � 4, Fe � 1,
Rp � 4, Cr � 2, Rg � 2, Ng � 4, Cy � 13, and λ � 1.5, which
satisfies the condition of Scenario 2. Suppose the proba-
bilities of initial game strategy choices of tripartite partici-
pants are all 0.5, and on this basis, in the following we discuss
the impact of initial strategy choice, the government penalty
intensity, social organizations’ positive and negative effects,
the effect’s increasing multiple, and the changes of public’
informing cost on evolutionary process and results.
5.1. /e Impact of Initial Strategy Choice on the Stability of
Game Strategy. According to replication dynamic equa-
tions, it can be seen that the evolutionary stable state of a
single game participant will be affected by the initial strategy
choices of other subjects. Based on this premise, this paper
verifies the results of strategies evolution by adjusting the
initial values. When examining the sensitivity of each game
participant to the initial strategy choice, the initial values of
other game subjects are set as 0.5. Respectively suppose the
initial state of the social organizations is x(0) � 0.2, 0.5, 0.7,
the initial state of the public is y(0) � 0.2, 0.5, 0.7, and the
initial state of the government is z(0) � 0.2, 0.5, 0.7, and the
other parameters keep unchanged. -en, the simulation
results can be shown by Figures 5 to 7.
As shown in these figures, no matter what the initial
strategy choice of tripartite participants is, with the probability
of social organizations choosing active allocation strategies
tends to 1, the public and the government will adopt the
strategies of tolerance and relaxing supervision, respectively,
which means that (1, 0, 0) is the evolutionary stability point.
As shown in Figure 5, with the increase of x, y and z will
quickly converge to 0, which further verifies Propositions 4
and 6. -is is because the increased awareness of social
organizations in allocating emergency supplies has
accelerated the process of emergencies prevention and
control, and both the government and the public can obtain
positive effects without paying extra costs for supervision.
-erefore, the government tends to relaxing supervision and
the public tends to tolerance.

10 Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society
As shown in Figure 7, with the increase of z, the speeds of
x converging to 1 are accelerated, which further verifies
Proposition 2. When the government practices strict su-
pervision with the help of blockchain platform, the infor-
mation of social organizations’ allocating emergency
supplies will be recorded in the blockchain and be open to all
of authorized participants; in this condition, the profits of
passive allocation gradually cannot compensate the loss of
fine by the government, the loss of social reputation, and so
on, which promotes social organizations’ active allocation.
From Figure 5 to Figure 7, it can be seen that no matter
what the initial strategy choice is, the speed of x converging
to 1 is less than the speed of y and z converging to 0. It
means that guiding social organizations to practice active
allocation needs a long-term process. -e process requires
the government actively to construct blockchain platform of
emergency supplies allocation and build the reward and
punishment mechanism to mobilize the participating en-
thusiasm of social organizations.
5.2. /e Impact of Government Penalty Intensity on the
Stability of Game Strategy. To analyse the impact of gov-
ernment penalties on the evolutionary game, we keep the
remaining parameters unchanged, and set the values of Fa as
follows: Fa � 0; Fa � 4; and Fa � 8. -e simulation result is
shown in Figure 8.
-e figure indicates that in the evolution process, with
the increment of the penalty imposed by the government on
the passive allocation of social organizations, the probability
of social organizations actively performing their duties in-
creases, and at the same time the speed that the government
evolves to strict supervision accelerates, which further
verifies Propositions 1 and 5. In the condition of strict
supervision, the government will supervise social organi-
zations at a lower cost with the help of blockchain platform.
And when the government’s profits from penalties exceed
the cost of strict supervision, the probability that the gov-
ernment enhances supervision by improving blockchain
platform will increase, which will promote social organi-
zations’ active allocation.
5.3./e Impact of Social Organizations’ Positive and Negative
Effects on the Stability of Game Strategy. To analyse the
impact of social organizations’ positive and negative effects
on the strategy stability, we keep the remaining parameters
unchanged, and set the values of Rn and Nn as follows:

Rn � 0, Nn � 0; Rn � 5, Nn � 5; and Rn � 10, Nn � 10. -e
simulation result is shown in Figure 9.
Figure 9 indicates that in the process of evolution, with
the increase of the positive effect of active allocation and the
negative effect of passive allocation, the probability of social
organizations choosing active allocation increases. When
the positive and negative effects gradually increase and
exceed the threshold, social organizations change from
passive allocation to active allocation, which further verifies
Proposition 1. It can be seen that the positive and negative
effects have a great impact on emergency supply allocation.
When the government uses blockchain platform to practice
supervision, the transparency of information will increase,
and the flowing speed of information will be accelerated
[22]; social organizations will evolve forward active allo-
cation to maintain the reputation and decrease the negative
effect.
5.4. /e Impact of Effect’s Increasing Multiple on the Stabil-
ity of Game Strategy. To analyse the impact of effect’s in-
creasing multiple on the strategy stability, we keep the
remaining parameters unchanged, and set the values of λ as
follows: λ � 1.1; λ � 1.5; and λ � 1.9 (corresponding the
application levels of blockchain platform from low to high).
-e simulation result is shown in Figure 10.
-e figure indicates that as the increasing multiple λ of
positive and negative effects increases, social organizations
will accelerate forward active allocation, which further
verifies Proposition 1. Social organizations’ strategy will vary
with the different application levels of blockchain platform.
-at is because when the application level of blockchain
platform is lower, the blockchain platform does not practice
effective supervision on social organizations, and with the
application level increasing, it can decrease the information
asymmetry and improve supervision efficiency.
5.5. /e Impact of the Public’ Informing Cost on the Sta-
bility of Game Strategy. To analyse the impact of the
public’ informing cost on the strategy stability, we keep the
remaining parameters unchanged, and set the values of Cr as
follows: Cr � 0; Cr � 2; and Cr � 5. -e simulation result is
shown by Figure 11.
-e figure indicates that in the evolutionary process, the
probability of the public choosing tolerance will accelerate
with the increase of the public’ informing cost Cr, which
further verifies Proposition 3. It can be seen that the public’
informing cost is an important factor affecting the allocation
management of emergency supplies. In the absence of
blockchain platform, due to the existence of information
islands, the public have higher cost of collecting information
to conduct supervision, which reduces their enthusiasm for
participating.
6. Results and Discussion
-e paper concentrates the problems of emergency supply
allocation and builds a tripartite evolutionary game model
among the government, social organizations, and the public
to analyse the impact of blockchain platform on emergency
supply allocation. -e results show that the initial strategy
choices, penalty intensity, positive and negative effects, ef-
fect’s increasing multiple, and public’ informing cost have
different influences on the governance of emergency supply
allocation.
(1) From the perspective of initial strategy choices, the
strategy choices of the government have a great
impact on the evolution and stability of social or-
ganizations. It needs a long term to guide social
organizations to actively take part in the emergency
supply allocation, and the government should speed
up the construction of blockchain platform to pro-
mote this process (different from [25, 26]).
(2) With the help of blockchain platform, increasing
penalty intensity for social organizations’ passive
allocation will increase the probabilities that social
organizations’ active allocation and the govern-
ment’s strict supervision.
(3) -e blockchain platform has a significant impact on
social organizations’ positive and negative effects,
effect’s increasing multiple, and public’ informing
cost, and improving the blockchain platform is of
great significance to improve the robustness of social
organizations’ active allocation.
Based on the above research conclusions, we construct
an emergency supply allocation governance system based on
blockchain, which includes coordination mechanism, trust
mechanism, supervision mechanism, and incentive mech-
anism, as shown in Figure 12.
(1) Coordination Mechanism. Based on the distributed
consensus technology of blockchain, all nodes can
participate in governance equally. After social or-
ganizations and the public join blockchain, the in-
formation of supply allocation will be shared among

and negative effects and effectively promote the
collaboration among subjects.
(2) Trust Mechanism. -e traceability mechanism and
tamper-proofing mechanism of blockchain tech-
nology can ensure the authenticity of information,
facilitate the public’s evidence collection and rights
protection, and realize penetrating supervision in the
whole process. In addition, asymmetric encryption
technology will ensure the security of information.
-ese all reduce the public’s informing cost and the
government’s supervision cost.
(3) Supervision Mechanism. -rough the smart contract
mechanism, the rights and responsibilities of par-
ticipants are clearly defined in the form of codes.
Once the trigger conditions are satisfied, the smart
contract will be enforced, which will improve the
self-discipline consciousness of each node. At the
same time, intelligent matching of supply and de-
mand information of supplies can be realized
through smart contract technology, which avoids
human interference and improves the accuracy and
efficiency of emergency supply allocation.
(4) Incentive Mechanism. -e foothold of promoting
sustainable emergency management lies in incentive

mechanism. By issuing tokens using blockchain and
using tokens as rewards, the system will arouse the
enthusiasm of multiple subjects [22].
Based on the above conclusions and mechanism design,
this paper puts forward the following suggestions to pro-
mote the process of emergency supply allocation
governance.
(1) In the emergency supply allocation, social organi-
zations hardly can practice active allocation con-
sciously. And in order to guide social organizations
allocating supplies actively, the government should
speed up the construction of information commu-
nication platform based on blockchain, practice real-
time supervision based on coordination mechanism,
trust mechanism, supervision mechanism and in-
centive mechanism, and provide according supports
in terms of policies, regulations, talents, and funds
[4].
(2) -e government should set reward and penalty
mechanism through smart contracts to increase the
punishment for illegal activities of social organiza-
tions seeking extra income and increase incentives
for the public who informs in compliance and social
organizations that practice active allocation, so as to
improve the efficiency of government supervision.
(3) In emergency supply allocation, even if there is a
blockchain platform, social organizations may still
allocate emergency supplies passively. -erefore, the
public should be guided to actively supervise the
allocation of emergency supplies and timely feedback
the problems of social organizations, which is con-
ductive to safeguard their own legitimate rights and
interests [22].
Emergency supply allocation has a great significant on
dealing with emergent events and ensuring the people’s
wellbeing, and the government should take full advantage of
blockchain technology to build a co-governance system to
guide all parts taking part in the emergency supply allocation
management actively. -is paper combines the evolutionary
game theory and simulation method to analyse the partic-
ipants strategies in emergency supply allocation; it is a new
try and will enrich the co-governance theory on the realm of
emergency management.
