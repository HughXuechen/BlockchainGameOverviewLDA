Abstract
Purpose – The paper aims to provide managerial recommendations for implementing circular economy (CE)
principles in both organizational and interorganizational contexts, including when using digital tools, such as
building information modeling (BIM) and blockchain. Drawn from the construction sector in the Netherlands,
the findings can be generalized to similar sectors where a company may receive multiple inputs as part of its
supply chain augmented by digital technologies.
Design/methodology/approach – Design addresses the research question: what are the strategic and
tactical approaches of organizations on the CE pathway? Sub-questions target initiatives pursued by
participants, and look toward information, roles and functions for supporting the CE process. Applying a
multiple-case study approach (21 semi-structured interviews with 29 participants) the paper explores strategic
initiatives of construction companies implementing CE pathways. The strength of the research design comes
from facilitation of rich and deep qualitative insights from Netherlands-based managers embedded within
global supply chains contributing to conceptual mapping. A limitation is data from one country (though
representing both national and multinational companies).
Findings – Interviewed managers share guidance for production-related construction companies anchored in
materials and product design. Recommendations include to (1) develop both internally and externally the
awareness of CE amongst leaders, (2) communicate with internal and external stakeholders for shared vision
across the supply chain, (3) start with pilot projects, and (4) ensure product data-integration for CE business
models through computer modeling and blockchain for decision-making processes, choices of materials,
business model coordination and product (re)design. Continuous learning about CE roles and responsibilities
amidst organizational process restructuring is required throughout linear to CE transitions. Extending the time
for the CE principles evaluation process would allow for reconsideration of decisionsmade for CE implemented
projects.
Originality/value – A novel CE gameplan with a hurdles and recommendations checklist provides an
operational interface with decision making points between internal factors for the host organization and
external supply chain partners.

Introduction: aiming for circular economy
This paper responds to the research question, what are the strategic and tactical approaches
of organizations on the circular economy (CE) pathway? Creating a CE and replacing the
current linear, take-make-waste economy would minimize human-induced climate change
(see for example EllenMacArthur Foundation, 2015). Implementation of CE requires complex
new business models. This involves collaborations across supply chains (Bocken et al., 2017;
Chen et al., 2022) to navigate barriers to adoption, such as the potential costs and uncertainties
of reverse logistics (Chileshe et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018; Ambekar et al., 2021; Jayasinghe et al.,
2019), or efficient recycling of material after usage (Lemille, 2019; Wijayasundara, 2021),

notwithstanding the genuine benefits of such approaches. Undoubtedly, governments will
facilitate this transition via political, economic and regulatory requirements, compelling
companies to adapt strategically and tactically to achieve the CE advantages. This paper
focuses attention on the construction sector in the Netherlands, which has complex, multi-
lateral supply chain connections and is a major driver of CE improvement. Managerial
recommendations will be developed for implementing and evaluating circular principles (see
for example, Khan et al., 2022; Kurniawan et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2022) including
when using digital tools such as building information modeling (BIM) and blockchain in both
organizational and interorganizational contexts.
CE is an alternative to a traditional take-make-waste linear economy (Bocken et al., 2017)
and requires ongoing research (Kirchherr et al., 2018). For this paper, we adopt the Kirchherr
et al. (2017, p. 224) definition of CE being:
. . . an economic system that replaces the ‘end-of-life’ concept with reducing, alternatively reusing,
recycling and recovering materials in production, distribution and consumption processes. It
operates at the micro level (products, companies, consumers), meso level (eco-industrial parks) and
macro level (city, region, nation and beyond), with the aim to accomplish sustainable development,
thus simultaneously creating environmental quality, economic prosperity and social equity, to the
benefit of current and future generations.
CE research is growing (Geissdoerfer et al., 2017; VanWeelden et al., 2016; Anastasiades et al.,
2022) in building and construction management. Many studies have detected key barriers
and enablers of CE for the construction industry (Caldera et al., 2020; Guerra and Leite, 2021;
Giorgi et al., 2022). There are some construction-specific frameworks developed out of
literature reviews and analyses (Bilal et al., 2020; Hossain et al., 2020; Mhatre et al., 2021),
however, empirical studies with a focus upon construction industry operational frameworks
are few. Wuni and Shen (2022, p. 575) identify CE design in construction projects having
essential elements for analysis including “longer economic life, deconstruction, zero-waste,
and possible valuable applications of by-products and wastes”, which are process and
operational scaffolds.
The technological application of BIM is a growing area of research capable of including
operational aspects of CE and sustainability in general (Wu et al., 2017a; Edirisinghe et al.,
2021; Sanchez et al., 2021; Mei et al., 2022). Some research exists on process models in
manufacturing, however, exemplars useful to operational transition to CE objectives are in
short supply (Widener, 2007). Furthermore, Wijewickrama et al. (2021) in a systematic
literature review found a structural hole in research between the construction and operations
stages in the CE literature, a gap addressed by this paper to make a pivotal contribution
building upon BIM and the broader sustainability literature.
The next section provides context for this research in the construction sector in the
Netherlands, a global leader in construction site recycling (van den Berg et al., 2020) and
government and industry engagement with CE. This is followed by the methodology used to
collect data, and discussion of the findings to discern a novel conceptual gameplan and
checklist. Practical implications with recommendations for business decision-makers and
areas for future research conclude the paper.
Literature: construction and CE in Netherlands and beyond
The Glasgow Climate Pact at COP26 intensified environmental approaches in all sectors,
including building and construction (Brodhag, 2021; UNEP, 2021). Furthermore, the
European Union (EU) remains committed to the Paris agreement (United Nations, 2015) by
implementing CE. The EU’s 2020 Circular Economy Action Plan promotes the European
Green Deal and involves integration of design, CE processes, sustainable consumption and
ECAM
resource maintenance within the EU economy (European Commission, 2020). The
Netherlands, among EU countries, has a smaller circularity gap with the percentage of
recycled materials being 24.5% in 2020 (Circle Economy, 2020). The Netherlands is
outperforming in CE regarding global circularity levels and the country’s goal is to reach
100%circularity by 2050. Up to 75%of that target could be gained through the four sectors of
construction, agriculture, renewable energies and repair and remanufacturing (Circle
Economy, 2019). The construction sector in the Netherlands is a major driver of CE
improvement ahead of the 2050 target. The sector currently generates 35% of the total waste
and 5–12% of national greenhouse gas emissions (Circle Economy, 2020).
In the Netherlands and globally, notwithstanding the war in Ukraine (Harper, 2022), and
the ongoing impact of Covid-19 pandemic on supply chains (Alicke et al., 2020; Deep et al.,
2022; Sarkar et al., 2022), there are numerous business-related CE hurdles, such as, products
being designed for long-term usage (transition frommake-to-break economy), the acceptance
of second-hand products by consumers, return-logistics of products, amended financial
balance sheet structure with reduced investment opportunities for the company and CE
friendly business models (Kirchherr et al., 2017). In an organizational context, adopting CE
values requires strategic commitment of the management board with a view to the next step
of implementing return logistics and CE values (Bernon et al., 2018). The transition to CE also
has major implications for establishing trust, transparency (for example, via mechanisms
such as blockchain) and collaboration within the supply chain both internal and external to
current organizational and industry sector boundaries (De Angelis et al., 2018). It should be
noted that, whilst blockchain itself is nascent in its uptake amongst the organizations, other
factors, such as, building mutual trust and partnerships can assist in implementation of both
CE and blockchain (see, for example, Kayikci et al., 2022; Luis et al., 2022; Rejeb et al., 2022;
Rotabi and Ali, 2022; Steenmans et al., 2021).
Moving from linear to CE, companies must create transition pathways together with their
supply chain partners (Joseph and Gaba, 2020), however, a roadmap of such pathways is not
available, thus heightening uncertainty and potential risks for decision makers. Market
transition theory prioritizes a series of interconnected actions to achieve objectives including
CE (McDowall, 2014). CE can act as a condition for sustainability (Geissdoerfer et al., 2017).
Sustainability is more open-ended, whereas the CE is more specific. The essential principle of
the CE concept is to disconnect economic growth from resource use (Kirchherr et al., 2017) so
materials can be reused continuously at different stages, reducing detrimental waste in the
ecological environment.
Supply chain collaborations and combined risk assessments are foundational tools to
initiate change from linear to CE (Miemczyk and Luzzini, 2019). Reducing waste by reusing
materials in production is a competitive competency that significantly reduces both energy
consumption and extraction of rawmaterials from nature (Rajala et al., 2019; Brockhaus et al.,
2019) contributing real cost savings for companies (Li et al., 2022; Noakes, 2021; Routray,
2022). For example, the CE approach in Europe is expected to contribute V1.8 trillion of
economic development by 2030, twice the current V0.9 trillion, and reduce CO2 emission by
48% by 2030, and up to 83% by 2050 (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2015; Lewandowski,
2016). Despite such advantages, the implementation of CE is slow. Circle Economy (2019)
views the world as 8.6% circular, with many further strategic actions required to close the
gap. Successful CE implementation needs policymakers to enable and encourage linear-to-
circular transformations by business entities (Lewandowski, 2016) and supply chain partners
(Van Weelden et al., 2016).
Transition from linear to circular business models involves all supply chain partners
(Batista et al., 2018). Ideally, a closed loop can be created with adjusted product design
enabling ease of repair, long-term usage, efficient disassembly and recyclability. Circular
incentives incorporated into the business strategies and operational tactics can encourage

long-term usage and increased collaboration within supply chains. Many organizations focus
on short-term profits through increased (and repeat) sales; this contrasts with long-term
usage and, therefore, lower sales in a CE. The organizational and supply chain perspective
needs changing.
Frameworks supportive of circular economy in a business context
The strategic development of CE in a business context involves expertise in sustainability,
supply chains and (new) business models (Geissdoerfer et al., 2017; MahmoumGonbadi et al.,
2021; Pieroni et al., 2021; Stumpf et al., 2021; Su�arez-Eiroa et al., 2019; VanWeelden et al., 2016).
The levers of control framework (Simons, 1995), with its four core aspects elucidates
operational control by focusing on interfaces between different stakeholders. The levers of
control framework balances the organization’s core values, perceived risks, strategic
uncertainties and the critical performance variables to facilitate control of organizational
processes. This framework has been used by academics and practitioners on the interface
between strategy and control (Martyn et al., 2016). Although the levers of control framework
is critiqued for potential ambiguity, it is argued this can be overcome when managerial
intentions for controls are separated from employee perceptions of controls (Tessier, 2012:
Arjali�es andMundy, 2013).Who has the control, and towhat extent, needs to be identified and
communicated across partners for CE to be effective beyond academia, policy circles and
boardrooms.
Developing strategic relationships between companies helps build sustainable supply
networks (Villena, 2019). This dependence plays a role, particularly at the early stage of the
formation of CE supply chains so adoption can increase. Shared vision with supply chain
partners is a prerequisite to achieving sustainable goals (Fatimah et al., 2020; Su�arez-Eiroa
et al., 2019), which requires combining social, ecological and economic values across the value
chain (Carter and Rogers, 2008). The characteristics of supply chain collaboration,
information sharing, incentive alignment, integrated supply chain processes and
collaborative performance system, can be adopted and transformed to work towards CE
collaboration (Simatupang and Sridharan, 2005). This led us to the question in this paper of
what are the strategic and tactical approaches of organizations on the CE pathway? Sub-
questions in this research focus on the initiatives that have been addressed, what kind of
information is supportive to this process and what roles and functions support linear-CE
transitions?
The construction sector is a material-intensive business; therefore, in the transition from a
linear to CE, an important step in decision making is the design phase of a building and the
requisite choice of materials. BIM (see for example Akbarieh et al., 2022; Charef et al., 2021;
Giorgi et al., 2022; Shooshtarian et al., 2022) supported by life cycle analysis (LCA), can
evaluate CE principles early in the process of design enabling appropriate evaluation and
calculation of the impact of the chosen materials (Wu et al., 2017a; Mei et al., 2022). Strategic
selection of materials can minimize energy use and enhance the options for dismantling
components after use (Sanchez et al., 2021; Xue et al., 2021). To support linear to CE
transitions, the authors suggest a structured process starting at the material selection stage
to create a building model based on further requirements of a customer. This should be
followed by a sustainability analysis using combination of complementary tools such as
energy simulations and LCA methods to evaluate and optimize the choices of materials and
design. This combination enables an informed recommendation for sustainable CE
improvements. Similar approaches have been applied in case research where BIM and
LCA as well as life cycle costing were integrated into the modeling (Akanbi et al., 2018). The
authors suggest that this combination of modeling tools has utility not only upfront in the
design process but also before demolition of the building to aid decisions about what
ECAM
materials will be extracted for different purposes in support of a transparent market for
recycled materials (Elghaish et al., 2022; Figueiredo et al., 2022; Kouhizadeh et al., 2022).
Methodology
A case study design enabled the research question to be approached multilaterally for a
holistic perspective. Case study research offers rich and deep qualitative insights into the how
and why questions (Yin, 2018). This methodology has prior application to data collection in
the construction sector (Bal et al., 2013; Calabrese et al., 2020; Zangiacomi et al., 2019). The
inclusion criteria for the case study companies incorporated public communication of CE
ambitions via websites and annual reports. The selections were made broadly across the
construction sector recognizing that strategic pathways to CE are the responsibility of
individual companies, yet to achieve the CE ecosystem the companies need diverse
partnerships. Therefore, companies of different sizes were selected, and these companies
occupied several roles and sections in the value chain. Three companies were oriented toward
strong social objectives and therefore had more integrated connections to governments than
commercial companies (six) in this linear-to-CE development pathway. Two of the companies
were multinational, the other seven mostly operated across the Netherlands.
All the interviewed companies were founded in the linear economy and must make the
linear to CE transition that the Netherlands construction industry is benchmarking.
Although the backgrounds and roles of each organizationwere different, common patterns in
the development pathway approach of the linear to CE transition could be recognized in the
selected cases, indicative of theoretical saturation being reached. Following approved
research ethics procedures, the connections of the researchers’ organizations were first
approached, and a snowballingmethod applied to identify, approach and select organizations
to be interviewed. Encouraged by governmental CE target-setting, most of the companies
working on visible projects in the CE space had a link to the construction sector. 21 semi-
structured interviews with 29 interviewees (Appendix 1) were conducted in nine
organizations in the construction sector in the Netherlands.
The interviews identified and captured the broad approaches of CE development.
Involved were an eclectic mix of general managers (2), sustainability managers (11),
operational managers (4), project managers (2) and representatives from other disciplines and
functions (10). Four interviews hadmultiple participants and lasted one to two hours. In these
combined meetings the participants were of complimentary backgrounds which created a
broader picture of the development process. The reliability of the interview process was
validated by investigating annual reports on published CE progress and internal documents.
The other interviews were conducted with one participant each and lasted forty-five to sixty
minutes. Based on participant language preferences, interviews were conducted either in
Dutch (translated to English) or English. With informed consent, the interviews were
recorded and written notes were kept. The interview data was supplemented with
information collected from secondary sources, such as, internal reports, annual reports and
websites. The publicly reported CE approaches formed the basis of a timeline and
participants shared some internal documents on CE development. When discussing the
findings, participants were structured per company (C1-9) and in chronological order of
interviews.
The interviews commenced with a project overview and the first question was to
introduce the participant, their positions within the case organization, and how their formal
position could be related to CE ideas and actions. Next set of questions explored and
described the development of CE within the company. Accordingly, participants were asked
to illustrate the organizational initiatives and practical case outcomes. Additionally, the
participants described the strategic and tactical decision-making processes and, specifically
Aiming for

for CE development, the role of partnerships, business models and measurements of CE
progress. The last question of an interviewwas to share the next steps of the organization for
subsequent years.
Figure 1 indicates the single or boundary-spanning role of each company in the
construction value chain. Some were production oriented, having access to rawmaterials; the
building-oriented companies had dominant focus on operational building processes. Design
companies had influence in designing buildings and infrastructure, based on end-user-
oriented companies and operated on behalf of the end-users of the buildings. Some companies
contributed to multiple supply chain roles. A description of the CE organizational initiatives
for the companies in Figure 1 is overviews in Appendix 1.
A template analysis was applied to the data collected (King and Brooks, 2016) to
iteratively draw out themes related to supply chain management, and levers of control (King,
2012). Next, from participants’ narratives, the initial template with first order concepts
included individuals showing leadership in initiating projects beyond company guidelines,
and the importance of learning, collaboration and strategic embeddedness. The second step
involved several iterations of data coding which led to a refined final template with second
order concepts shown in Figure 2. Although the development paths of the companies were
different, a rising maturity level could be recognized, along with both internal and external
development topics. Structured themes enabled combined internal and external elements and
CE pathways to generate findings and conceptual graphics reflective of CE development. An
example of analysis of the strategic interventions in development pathways for one of the
companies is included in Appendix 2.
The discussion section next is designed around 2nd order themes. The authors
acknowledge themain themes of alignment, system structure and behavior were higher order
concepts underpinning the strategic approach and tactical decisions in the 2nd order which
were the focus for addressing the specific research question. Data and themes emergent from
the interviews with both internal and external orientations are discussed next. Please note
that quotations in the discussion are verbatim from both native and non-native English
participants and, in the interest of keeping the data as authentic as possible, the authors have
chosen not to impose their own translation to the quoted text, but to keep the original
spoken words.
Discussion of the findings: construction of a gameplan
This section discusses the participants’ experiences and reflections of their pathways and
accompanying successes or failures discernible from both internal and external orientations.
The participants were able to identify the typical CE choices in the construction sector for

implementation being: (1) themultipurpose applicability of buildings, (2) the use of recyclable
or bio-based materials, (3) easy-to-remove connections (e.g. no sealant but nails), (4) smart
solutions reducing energy and optimizing usability (product-as-a-service propositions
replacing ownership to the supplier to make accountable for durable, energy saving
products). The interviews furthermore revealed adopting technological tools such as
implementing building information management (BIM) models to evaluate CE principles in
strategic decision making (Edirisinghe et al., 2021; Sanchez et al., 2021; Mei et al., 2022) as an
additional step to evaluating sustainable choices in a structuredwaywhich, in turn, can assist
to streamline and frame the decision-making process. Analysis also pays attention to the
intersection of levers of control (Simons, 1995) with the empirical data.
Internal orientation
The following three themes captured the participants’ experiences of reflections upon CE
pathways from internal orientation.
Strategic impact and alignment. Distinctive pathways were identified for enhanced
awareness of CE involving communication from government and other regulatory agencies
(including industry associations), clients asking for circularity, a sustainability manager (or
equivalent) advocating CE principles and chief executive officer (CEO) or senior manager
becoming a champion for CE (Puntillo et al., 2021). Participant C1P1mentioned the orientation
in society as a logical starting point predisposing towards CE:We are an organization with a
role in society. So, we are not lagging behind when it comes to a concept such as circularity. We
are running, I do not want to say at the very front, but it landed at this company quite quickly.
Sometimes by individuals, people who say, we do not have to do anything with that, sometimes
by leaders. This comment addressed core values as a key strategic component and driver (in
this case for the context of CE), which is one of the main elements of the levers of control
framework (Simons, 1995).
When positions on CE were articulated in the organizational hierarchy, the pathway to
credibility and adoption of CE practices grew. Subsequently, more stakeholder dialog
(imperative for an integrated annual report) and public commentary on CE (Guerra and Leite,
2021; Giorgi et al., 2022) created staff engagement and organizational commitment, as
participant C3P1 highlighted:What you see, it is the right time. Because you just see a lot, it’s
buzzing in the organization. A lot of people find it interesting to get started. Annual reports

analysis found improved strategic alignment, from simply mentioning CE intention, to more
explicit description in the following year(s). Participant C5P1 reflecting on this process said
the company: . . . needed targets, [we] created targets. For circularity that was a little bit
different, because that was the new kid on the block so to speak. So, on purpose, I put circularity
on, but I did not put a target in. Participants generally expressed those external partners were
willing to invest in circularity target-setting to assist an influential client, with participant
C5P1 stressing the need to communicate within the supply chain about the required changes:
From suppliers’ point of view, there should be a development path together.
Often awareness grew out of governmental intentions, clients asking for circularity, the
sustainability manager aiming for next steps, or a change of the CEO or another senior
executive. The topic increased in importance if it was mentioned by a senior executive
(Routray, 2022), or if formal CE positions were created and made visible in the organizational
hierarchy, such as the strategy department. The sustainability manager of company 1 (C1P2)
reiterated this point by sharing: I mean the operational director is the most important man for
circular. He embraced circularity; he participates in the task force. So that is really important.
That it is valued highly in the organization.Once CEwas brought to the fore as a conversation
topic, it rapidly escalated on the priority list. The first step generally involved a vague
intention being mentioned in the annual report which, in the following year(s), was
consolidated by communication of more explicit aims and strategies. As intentions clarified
and integrated into the strategic roadmap, evidence of CE in internal and external measures
became visible. In this vein, C1P2 mentioned:
The roadmap is actually about [four] topics about circular economy, about energy, about making our
business and the environment more sustainable. And for circular economy we made a distinction
between infrastructural residual flows and operational residual flows and we looked at the front and
back and set up about 10 actions. So, these 10 actions need to be taken to ensure that wewill be a zero-
waste company by 2030.
As CE-related awareness, communication and strategy crystallized, the external partners
showed willingness to invest in circularity by collaborative target-setting with an influential
client (Simatupang and Sridharan, 2005). Clear communication of priorities was manifesting
as one lever of control (Simons, 1995) for the minimization of strategic uncertainties in the
pursuit of CE, and smooth communication of information was helping stakeholders (internal
and external) come aboard for the CE journey.
Organizational structure, learning and responsibilities. The first steps of external
collaboration involved gathering information and participating in workshops and pilot
projects. Such proactive learning involved, for example, hiring interns to explore possibilities
for positioning the organization in the CE, and creating insights into a future vision for the
organization. C5P1 explained some learning process steps for them:
But when I start, climate was on, nature was on, safety was on, all topics were on, but not circularity
yet. We also used the principles I had interns working for me. You should know, I had in the last few
years working 15 or 20 students working for me. And I was already have working 5 interns working
on circularity. Obviously in university the topic was already a little bit bigger, in the sustainability
arena, the topic was already there, but it was not yet on my action plan.
Other forms of proactive learning included exploring with universities, nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs), or other knowledge partners, and educating internal employees for
mutual understanding of the CE concept. Noted was the significance of involving influential
decision-makers in CE, like a famous architect who had worked on a CE building, and with
task forces, to become a champion disseminating CE learning internally. The taskforce
needed to have a portfolio of projects (supervised by a program manager) accelerating
progress and enhancing visibility amongst employees. Part of this process, as viewed by
ECAM
C3P1, involved exploring diverse project options, as encapsulated in their words: you are
going to investigate things to see if that might become a project. Not only do you have to start up
studies to do the next 5 years, but you also have to start up studies to work towards that long
term vision. So that’s why we cut it down into practical things we do over the next 5 to 6 years.
But we do keep that dot on the horizon in mind in order to deploy things that are long-term
development. This was essentially an expression of risk factoring as one of the levers of
control (Simons, 1995). Organizational departments needed to integrate circular thinking into
their practice, sometimes by procurement managers asking different questions from the
market, or contract managers attending to return logistics or financial managers thinking
beyond existing collaborative structures, legal contracts and known risks. Accordingly,
integrated, decentralized responsibility was emerging from the data as the next level of
maturity in learning on the CE journey (Wu et al., 2017b). Moving forward, companies will
need to analyze how the potential of decentralized responsibility fits with their overall
organizational and decision-making structure.
Changing behavior from linear to CE. Interviews revealed individuals who led in circular
development conversations were driven internally. To motivate others, these individuals
then incorporated external drivers as part of the CE topic on different meeting agendas
(Giorgi et al., 2022). The external drivers involved examples of investors asking for circular
approaches, external influencers requesting the host organization to participate in a CE
initiative, or internal employees generating new circular ideas. Participant C3P1
described this:
as a company, we want to become circular. So that also means something for the canteen, the coffee
mugs and so on. So, it really has to get into the DNA of the company. And people who do projects
always have to ask themselves: are we really making the most sustainable choice here? Not just in
purchasing, but everyone has to do something with it. So it’s much more of an organizational issue
than projects as it were. That’s why this is becoming even more complicated.
A training priority was for procurement professionals to understand different tender
structures and processes for documenting and sharing information. Training consumes time
and involves identifying the nature, sources, methods of data collection, data analysis and
subsequent sharing of data along the supply chain. Accordingly, the time-intensive reality of
CE tendering compared with linear tenders may not always fit into the organizational
requirements, project requirements and deadlines. The CE is based on reusing materials;
therefore, to structure and create a market for second-hand materials, data gathering is
necessary. Part of a changed behavior path is the gathering of data on materials, especially
facilitated by BIM applications (Mei et al., 2022) acting as a strategic lever (Simons, 1995). The
interview data was flagging risks and strategic uncertainties across different department
priorities, which could lead to identification of critical performance variables that could be
better monitored. Participant C5P1 discussed development of a materials passport together
with other similar companies: the rawmaterials passport we are using is not developed by us. It
is developed together with others on these measures in all of our companies, because we are
quite alike.
Madaster (2020) was mentioned by participants as an example of creating a platform for
the storage of the data structure and sharing with the clients. Organizations gather
information independently, or in partnership with similar client organizations, to organize
logistics ofmaterials andwaste just-in-time. For example, organized logisticswould prevent a
building being demolished while simultaneously demolishing the circular materials (Chileshe
et al., 2018). It is hence better to design for reuse ofmaterials to facilitate circularity back to the
suppliers. The message was emphasized by two participants as an important enabler of
successful CE. Participant C1P3 mentioned the relevance of these logistics: you see, all is
logistics. It is important, however, that the residual flows are as clean as possible. You really have

to separate everything on the construction site. Only glass, no sealant edges or fasteners. A
rubber or aluminum should be collected separately. The more it is mixed with other materials,
the less the residual flow is worth. In terms of levers of control (Simons, 1995), the interview
discussion data was showing circularity as a core performance value to be linkedwith critical
performance indicators through organized logistics.
Next, we focus on themes from interview data highlighting the externally oriented
organization development concepts initiating the transition of supply chains to CE design.
External orientation
The following themes reflect the participants’ experiences and observations of external
orientation in CE pathways.
Value chain collaboration and positioning. Participants embraced collaborative learning of
capabilities and identification of resources for overcoming challenges in CE implementation.
Collaboration helps external positioning and subsequent publicity through dialog with
internal and external stakeholders. This serves multiple purposes, from sharing of
organizational ambitions for CE, to proactive dialog with stakeholders to build future
vision, right down to initiatives for collaborative consumption (Stumpf et al., 2021). After a
phase of sharing ideas and learning together with other partners, new partnerships facilitate
the future circular journey of the company. In the experience of one participant (C5P1), these
dialogs and partnerships either initiate or cull the strategy of mergers and acquisitions in
alignment with CE objectives. This participant shared the example of broadening of the value
chain: if you look at the CE, broadening the chain is extremely important. We do not have all the
links in the chain itself, but that is what we are looking for, partners. Our takeover strategy is
also along those lines. By broadening the supply chain, exchanging data will become more
important, for example, by integrating blockchain applications. Recognition that strategic
uncertainties had significant external origins as a lever of control (Simons, 1995) was
providing impetus for respectively expanding informal and formal collaborations and
partnerships.
Internal learning and joint CE pathways proved important for enabling CE business.
Sustainability departments generally do not have their own budgets and are, therefore,
reliant upon the CE interventions of their internal colleagues, like asset management. Internal
learning and joint development paths are thus important to enable a CE business, especially
in BIM-enabled construction (Chen et al., 2022). One of the participants (C5P2) describes how
this is perceived: We are still engineering customer-specifically but must change to modeling
more process- [and], production-specifically. You have to move together towards
standardization and a degree of modularity. Once you have that, you can organize reuse.
Enable a CE market, conditions and regulations. Next comes the defining and finalizing of
the CE conditions. Undertaking pilot projects with partners was the first step for all
interviewed organizations, which involved exploring alternatives for new materials, and
engaging with fresh collaborations or new circular business models. The benefits of piloting
are economical investment, speedy decision making and collaboration between finance, legal
and procurement departments with clearly defined protocols. Collaborative updating of
regulations becomes an important step, whether in areas of waste and/or financial and/or
accounting regulations (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2020). Another hurdle to overcome as
part of CE journey is the criteria of certain profit ratios in a sector being used by financial
investors. These ratios determine the working capital for different business models.
Participant C2P7 described frustrations on the CE-boundaries: financing laws, rating
agencies, et cetera. There is a whole series of laws, a change in legislation is needed to allow this
type of deal.What does the (EU) committee say, we are in strange times. Climate is in such times,
you have to question laws that have been passed in order to get over them. There are also big
ECAM
interests that are against it, and they are very powerful. In context with the levers of control
framework (Simons, 1995) the datawas showing risk areas and strategic uncertainties adding
to frustration in the CE transition.
New companies can be started to bring market and supply together for current second-
handmaterials or share data on future available second-handmaterials. Standardization for a
sector can also be beneficial to practice. When a window, door or wall has the same standard
measures as part of the fittings, it can easily be given a second life after demolishing a
building. This would amplify the second-hand reusability of materials and modules. Another
example of a practical CE condition is optimizing logistics of materials and waste by storing
and sorting second-hand materials (Chileshe et al., 2018; Ambekar et al., 2021). Thus,
matching of supply and demand on modular materials is required.
Optimize CE structure and profitability. This phase involves optimization of CE
implementation after learning from the pilot projects. Accordingly, it requires
championing by senior management and key stakeholders, and identification of a current
profitable product with large market value (that continues to generate return for the
company), and a new circular product that incorporates reuse of second-hand materials (as a
market pilot test case). There is risk involved for the company because value from the new
circular product cannot be predetermined when the market is not yet established (Miemczyk
and Luzzini, 2019). For example, it is hard to accurately predict the value of untested new
asphalt after 15 years of usage. Therefore, integrating data in circular concepts to create long-
term value is important for measuring long-term profitability. The latter was explained by
participant C1P3: you can dismantle it and rebuild it somewhere else. That is a great advantage.
But just the steel. That has a daily price. So, if you have a material passport for everything with
the data from Madaster, you know what materials are in a building. Steel simply has a daily
price. You can quantify that in this way. Here was further evidence of the need to control and
monitor critical performance variables.
CE can be integrated into the design, use and after-use phases. Organizations often only
redesign their products or introduce a circular business model in the use-phase. The pinnacle
of CE is to develop an entirely closed loop CE, where each of design, long-term usage and
optimized recycling and reusing are integrated (Krausmann et al., 2009; MahmoumGonbadi
et al., 2021). The participants considered production organizations, with large investments in
machinery and a need to increase profitability. The pilot projects are initiated in noncore
products as a reality-testing step allowing for evaluation by senior management and
significant stakeholders. C2P7 in industry described the challenges: . . . to build that
machinery takes 3 years. And then you have to build up the sales, then it would take 5 years from
now until that thing runs well. Then you have to make sure that the return of investment of the
invested money is allowed to take longer than usual, since, you will only get a return in 5 years.
You have to prefinance everything. The balance sheet of the industry cannot stand that, but the
balance sheet of a pension fund probably can. That is whywe are nowworking on how to tie these
things together.This statement identifies all four levers of control (Simons, 1995) being critical
in the lifeblood aspects of finance and return on investment relative to CE. Circularity may be
the core value, but then the risks and strategic uncertainties are exacerbated by longer
transition time, thus putting emphasis on monitoring critical performance variables.
Integrating data creates long term value. The challenge of data uncertainty for long-term
profitability is significant and reiterates the need to integrate data in circular concepts to
create long term value (Kirchherr et al., 2018). CE data should integrate into the design, use
and after-use phases. Over time, the aim is to entirely develop a closed loop CE where both
design, long-term usage and optimized recycling and reusing are integrated. In accordance
with existing knowledge about reverse logistics (Chileshe et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018), the role of
closed loops to assist that objective would be among the highest contributions of CE.
Aiming for
bullseye
Contribution of the research: gameplan with hurdles and recommendations
The structural hole identified by Wijewickrama et al. (2021) between the construction and
operations stages in the literature may be partly filled by the findings of this paper.
Furthermore, gaining early insight into the structure and design process of CE can improve
understanding of the impacts (Wu et al., 2017a; Mei et al., 2022). Figure 3 recasts the interview
findings in a dartboard visualization with interview data formulated as darts representing
tactical normative gameplays based on the levers of control framework (Simons, 1995) of core
values, risks, strategic uncertainties and critical performance variables.
The CE pathways start for incumbents on the outside of the dartboard with either
internally focused strategic approaches (the black areas on the dartboard), or the externally

focused strategic actions (the white areas). Due to learning and collaboration, companies can
move systematically and strategically towards bullseye, included here as a closed loop CE.
The practical strategic actions to accelerate CE (Figure 3) are derived from analysis of the
empirical interview data and drawn from different principles than traditional linear
approaches. In applied scenarios, situational analyses can lead to strategic and tactical
priorities, like the analogy of a dart game, with the targets being strategic outcomes and the
darts being tactical manoeuvres. Sometimes an internal pathway strategic element is
weighted more heavily as a starting priority and then the approach moves systematically
through the other internal priorities before going to the external. More often, companies will
experience simultaneous internal and external priority mixes based on the situational
analysis, and/or pressures from their internal and external stakeholders. Figure 3 presents
the strategic field and weightings may vary according to prevalent conditions until internal
(A, B and C) and external tactics (1, 2 and 3) drive closer to the desired CE bullseye. Together
the changes in these elements frame the CE principles for an organization which can then be
translated into action through BIM and other established tools.
The dartboard is the strategic field with CE as bullseye, and the surrounding darts are
tactical normative gameplay capable of aligning with desired strategic thematic sections
moving toward the bullseye. Reconfiguring product-design, business models and return
logistics, requires a value chain redesign in collaboration with supply chain partners. With
this novel gameplan conceptualized, we move now to conclusions and recommendations to
facilitate CE transitions.
Conclusion and recommendations
The aim of the paper was to provide managerial recommendations for implementing CE
principles in both organizational and interorganizational contexts. A limitation of the
research was that data was obtained only from Netherlands-based managers. Nevertheless,
the participants were, at the time of writing this paper, immersed in global supply chain
situations and dealing with issues cutting across sectors that ally with construction sector
representing both national and international companies. In that sense, some of the broader
strategic findings have generalized application for CE transitions beyond the construction
sector.
The research questioned the strategic and tactical approaches of organizations on the CE
pathway to overcoming the barriers (Ambekar et al., 2021; Caldera et al., 2020; Guerra and
Leite, 2021; Giorgi et al., 2022). Findings from the multi case study interviews (Figure 3) and
accompanying hurdles and recommendations checklist (Table 1) contributed towards a
gameplan helping fill a structural hole in research between the construction and operations
stages in the CE literature. The high-level, cross-disciplinary profiles of interviewed
participants added new insights to the CE conversations by bringing forth priority bullseye
points and CE strategic initiatives tactical guidance questions. These points are crucial
because the dartboard represents how a CE bullseye is central, but sometimes internal or
external starting priorities take precedence on the pathway and may vary according to
situational analysis.
Acknowledging the rules of this new game have not previously been well-defined, Table 1
is a compilation of hurdles and recommendations as a checklist for decision-makers to
identify starting points on the CE pathway for their respective organizations. The hurdles
and recommendations are generalizable across industry sectors and represent precursors for
pathway decisions during strategy formulation. Alignment of the relevant tactics (darts) with
the strategic priorities (dartboard sections) should be an organization’s necessary aim,
because a misalignment of these crucial elements leads to cost blowouts, environmental
damage and general failure to achieve CE.
Aiming for
bullseye
The guidance of Table 1 can shape the development of weighted criteria over the course of
strategy development meetings. Mapping the criteria to tactical darts relevant to pathways
toward the bullseye on the strategic field diagram of Figure 3 enables managers to hit the CE
bullseye more reliably for all internal and external stakeholders.
The practical guidance for construction and other industries varies from crafting both
internal and external development paths, to working on strategy and measurement, building
newmarkets and propositions, and restructuring respectively the value chain, collaborations
and stakeholder behavior. The findings supportmanagers to develop transition pathways for
their organizations specifically by using the dartboard framework (Figure 3) to establish
strategic priorities and weightings then, guided by Table 1 decisions and actions, to create
relevant operating policies and procedures. Computer modeling tools for the construction
sector are already used and could be further refined via CE principles to evaluate the choices
for design in material and energy use for building performance for the life cycle of the
building. This would require a more structured pathway and additional time to learn and
optimize choices towards sustainable and circular outcomes. Findings of this research
provide a foundation to design pathways in a more coordinated way and to engage internal
and external stakeholders at an earlier stage of the process. This gameplan may be applied in
other contexts to build upon BIM, ongoing blockchain developments and the broader
sustainability literature.
The participants also shared recommendations for peers thinking of embarking on the CE
journey. First and foremost, collaboration between different value chain partners on the client
and production sides, and even competitors, must occur for joint learning about CE
pathways. Whilst some business operation decisions will be patented, certain levels of
transparency and trust (as shown in examples of blockchain) will be required for new
standards to be set in the market, and CE effectively achieved. This leads onto the second
recommendation to build interdependency between client and production for a continuous
learning process in the value chain. The process involves together identifying and making

respective resource investments and, when required, sharing resources (as seen in cases of
“shared economy”).
Partners in value chains need to collaboratively resolve conflicting regulatory targets
in their quest for CE. For example, between the use of virgin (energy intensive) versus
recycled material whilst paying for mandated CO2 emissions from their production
facilities. Similarly, there needs to be mutual understanding of any investments being
made by partners to deliver circular products. This is imperative when large investments
in machinery upgrades and research and development, for example, may have to be made
upfront, with limited clarity about return on investment based on future market
developments.
In summary, transition from a linear to a circular business model, requires a
gameplan with strategic involvement of all supply chain partners. Circular incentives
may be added to the business model to encourage long-term usage or reuse of materials
post-production. Prioritized actions aiming for bullseye help the construction sector
manage its complex, multilateral supply chain connections as a major driver of CE
improvement.
