Abstract
Blockchain Technology (BCT) is expanding day by day and is used in all pillars of life and projects. In this research, we 
survey applicable BCT in project management for the first time. We presented a Resource-Constrained Time–Cost-Qual-
ity-Energy-Environment Tradeoff Problem by considering BCT, Risk and Robustness (RCTCQEETPBCTRR) in project 
scheduling. We utilize hybrid robust stochastic programming, worst case, and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) to cope 
with uncertainty and risks. This type of robustification and risk-averse is presented in this research. A real case study is pre-
sented in a healthcare project. We utilize GAMS-CPLEX to solve the model. Finally, we analyze finish time, conservative 
coefficient, the confidence level of CVaR, and the number of scenarios. The most important research result is that applying 
BCT decreases cost, energy, and pollution and increases quality. Moreover, the total gap between RCTCQEETPBCTRR and 
without BCT is approximately 2.6%. When compacting finish time happens or if the conservative coefficient increases to 
100%, costs, energy, and pollution environment increase, but quality decreases. If the confidence level of CVaR increases, 
the cost, energy, and environment function functions grow up, and quality is approximately not changed.

Introduction
Nowadays, Blockchain Technology (BCT) is one of the 
novel technologies that can change the world and move 
to decentralize and remove inefficiencies of centralized 
systems. BCT is a decentralized, Distributed Ledger Tech-
nology (DLT) that records data as a digital asset. This data 
cannot be modified and is applicable for payments, cyber-
security, and healthcare industries. A blockchain contains 
information about the sender, receiver, and the number of 
cryptocurrencies to be transferred. A set of rules—called a 
smart contract—is stored on the blockchain and executed 
automatically to speed transactions. A smart contract can 
define conditions for corporate bond transfers, includ-
ing terms for travel insurance to be paid and much more 
(Almutairi et al. 2022; Tagde et al. 2021).
Researchers recently suggested using BCT in Project 
Management Offices (PMOs) (Hewavitharana et al. 2019). 
Applying this technology improves and does activities well 
and on time. For example, defining suppliers’ delay when 
they do activities with disruption by embedding BCT is con-
cise. Moreover, the smart contract can help pay the vendor 
and subcontractor automatically and remove the delay in 
payment (Akhavan et al. 2021). This issue decreases activi-
ties’ cost, execution time, and project pollution and improves 
quality and energy consumption (Kim et al. 2020).

Of course, there is not much research on the applicabil-
ity of BCT in project management. We need to show how 
to improve scheduling, quality, energy, and pollution by 
considering BCT in the mathematical model. However, 
increasing resiliency, agility and sustainability are advan-
tages of BCT in the project management area (Ivanov 2020). 
Resiliency and flexibility in facing costs by doing activi-
ties shortly and increasing transparency in transactions and 
exchange with vendors and suppliers with agility (Kamble 
et al. 2021). Using BCT makes it smooth and decreases the 
sharpness of costs, quality, energy, and environment in a 
compact situation (cf. Figure 1).
Adding BCT to RCTCQEETP is one of the subjects 
showing how BCT helps schedule well and improves sus-
tainability and resource constraints. Therefore, we must go 
to novel technologies to amplify resiliency in complex situ-
ations like COVID-19, natural disasters and disruptions in 
project management. The leading organization in the project 
industry worldwide tries to minimize the time of projects 
and do more tasks.
Eventually, the innovation of this research and the main 
objective is as follows:
1. Applying BCT and resource-constrained in TCQEETP 
(RCTCQEETP),
2. Considering risk and robustness in RCTCQEETP,
3. Sustainability, resiliency, and agility improvement in 
project scheduling by RCTCQEETP.
The paper is organized as follows. In the “Survey on 
related work” section, we survey related work on the tradeoff 
problems. The “Problem description” section is stated the 
novel TCQEETP by considering resource-constrained, BCT, 
risk, and robustness. In the “Results and discussion” section, 
the results of research and sensitivity analysis are presented. 
In the “Managerial insights and practical implications” sec-
tion, the managerial insights and practical implications are 
discussed. In the “Conclusions and outlook” section, the 
conclusion is summarized.
Survey on related work
One of the problems that show a good relation of pillars of 
project management in the present is the time–cost tradeoff 
problem. However, many researchers have contributed to 
this problem in the recent decade.
Time–cost tradeoff problem (TCTP)
Toğan and Eirgash (2018) studied the TCTP. A contribu-
tion of this research was using non-dominating sorting 
multi-objective teaching learning-based optimization (NS-
MTLBO) algorithm with a new initial population approach. 
Toğan and Eirgash (2019) surveyed a TC tradeoff optimi-
zation for construction projects. They suggested teaching 
learning-based optimization (TLBO) with Modified Adap-
tive Weight Approach (MAWA) for solving the model. They 
found that MAWA-TLBO has better performance than other 
algorithms. Ballesteros-Pérez et al. (2019) developed a non-
linear TCTP with activity crashing and collaborative or non-
collaborative resources. They utilized a Genetic Algorithm 
(GA) to solve the model.
Time–cost‑quality tradeoff problem (TCQTP)
Wood (2017) surveyed the TCQTP for gas and oil projects. 
They applied stochastic and fuzzy multi-objective for opti-
mization. They solve the model by using a memetic multi-
objective algorithm. Kosztyán and Szalkai (2018) expressed 
a hybrid TCQTP. They suggested a matrix-based method 
with task dependencies and undecided, supplementary task 
completion. Wang et al. (2021) considered a TCQTP for 
planning construction projects. They used multi-objective 
optimization of Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithms 
(NSGA-II). Mrad et al. (2019) suggested a Mixed Integer 
Linear Programming (MILP) for TCQTP. They considered 
the project budget as a constraint. They utilized Monte-Carlo 
Simulation for getting results.
Banihashemi et al. (2021) presented the TCQTP with 
environmental impacts for construction projects. They uti-
lized GAMS software to gain results and obtain different 
scenarios for ecological consequences. Luong et al. (2021) 
optimized a multi-mode TCQTP for a construction pro-
ject. They utilized opposition multiple objective difference 
evolution (OMODE) for optimizing the model. Moreover, 
they compared OMODE with NSGA-II, Multiple Objec-
tive Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO), and Multiple Fig. 1  Effects of BCT on project management

Objective Differential Evolution (MODE). They found that 
the proposed algorithm has better performance than other 
algorithms. Sharma and Trivedi (2022) modeled a TCQTP 
for construction projects. They applied the Analytical Hier-
archy Process (AHP) to gain weight between activity and 
quality. Finally, they used NSGA-II to obtain Pareto front 
for time, cost, and quality.
Time–cost‑quality/risk tradeoff problem (TCQRTP)
Tran and Long (2018) presented the TCRTP. They applied 
adaptive multiple objective differential evolution (AMODE) 
for solving the model. They suggested considering risks 
in their model to enhance schedule flexibility. Long et al. 
(2019) optimized the multi-mode TCRTP. To solve the 
model, they considered a hybrid multiple objective evolu-
tionary algorithms for optimizing by Artificial Bee Colony 
(ABC) and differential evolution (DE). They found that 
MOABCDE has more efficiency to show Pareto front in the 
model.
Nwaneri and Anyaeche (2018) proposed the TCQRTP in 
a magnetic resonance imaging installation project. Moreo-
ver, they added a fuzzy number to tackle uncertainty. They 
solved the model by Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm 
(MOGA) and applied the Technique for the Order of Pref-
erences by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The 
results indicate a tradeoff relationship exists between time, 
cost, quality, and risks. Mahdiraji et al. (2021) considered a 
TCRTP with a knowledge-based approach.
Moreover, they added hesitant fuzzy information to tackle 
uncertainty. They tried to reduce the project’s time by 20% 
compared with the deterministic approach. An R&D project 
application was the real case study.
Time–cost‑quality‑energy‑environment tradeoff 
problem (TCQEETP)
Lotfi et al. (2022c) suggested a complete form of tradeoff. 
They surveyed a TCQEETP with resource-constrained 
(RCTCQEETP). The real case study was bridge construc-
tion. They applied robust convex optimization to cope with 
uncertainty. They embedded Augmented Epsilon Constraint 
(AUGEPS) to get results for multi-objective.
Research gap
The classification of the literature is addressed in Table 1. It 
can be seen that researchers do not survey the RCTCQEET-
PBCTRR. This study investigates the RCTCQEETPBCTRR 
and uses mathematical problems to optimize the best time, 
cost, energy, and environment for projects by considering 
BCT.
The main innovation of this research is as follows:
1. Applying BCT in the RCTCQEETP,
2. Considering risk and robustness in the RCTCQEETP,
3. Improving sustainability, resiliency, and agility in pro-
ject scheduling.
Problem description
In this research, we want to show the effect of BCT in pro-
ject scheduling until sustainability, resiliency, and agility 
of projects improve. Therefore, we develop a new model of 
the RCTCQEETP by considering BCT, risk, sustainability, 
resiliency, and agility. When we add BCT in this model, all 
parameters cost, quality, energy, and environment improve, 
but we have fixed cost and variable (maintenance) costs for 
establishing BCT. Finally, we want to show how the model 
selects to run with BCT or without BCT by considering the 
fixed cost and maintenance cost of BCT.
Moreover, we have resource constraints and want to cope 
with the risk of activity disruption and improve projects’ 
resiliency, robustness, and sustainability. We add risk crite-
ria and robust stochastic optimization to tackle with robust-
ness. Using BCT makes it smooth and decreases the sharp-
ness of costs, quality, energy, and environment in a compact 
situation.
To describe the mathematical model, consider a project 
based on an Activity on Node (AON) network. This net-
work has i ∈ {1, ... , |I|} ⊂ I nodes that show the activities. 
The activity i has a normal time ( tis ), normal cost, quality, 
energy, and environment (pollution) ( �kis ) under the scenario 
s , while the compacted time ( t′
is
 ) and compact cost, quality, 
energy, and environment (pollution) ( �′
kis
 ) under scenario s 
are denoted.
Assumptions
The main assumptions of the proposed model are as follows:
1. No activity is done before providing the prerequisites 
(Nunez et al. 2016).
2. Every activity has uncertain time, cost, quality, energy, 
and pollution (environment).
3. I t  s h o u l d  b e  n o t e d  t h a t  tis ≥ t′
is
, 
�kis ≤ ��
kis
|k ∈ {Cost, Energy},  a n d 
�kis ≥ ��
kis
|k ∈ {Quality, Environment}.
4. After considering BCT, because the effects of BCT on 
cost, quality, energy, and environment, �′
kis
 change to 
�bkis ≤ �′
kis
.
5. By reducing time, cost and energy consumption increase, 
quality and pollution decrease.
6. It should be noted that the energy consumption of each 
activity is estimated based on the consumption amount 
of energy-based resources.

7. Activities have a daily demand for their required 
resources.
8. Multiple renewable and non-renewable resources are 
defined. The supply capacity of resources is restricted 
and is known at the beginning of the project (Bowman 
1994).
In the following, the mathematical model of the 
time–cost-quality-energy-environment tradeoff is intro-
duced. In Fig. 2, we show that duration ( xis ) is between nor-
mal time ( tis ) and compact time ( t′

).

Decision variables:
The objective function (1) considered minimizing the 
weighted expected value, minimax, and CVaR for the objec-
tive function k , including cost, quality, energy, and envi-
ronment (pollution). This form of the objective function is 
proposed for robustness and risk-averse against disruption 
in the worst condition (Lotfi et al. 2021b).
Constraints (2) are the summation of direct and indi-
rect parameters for objective functions k under scenario s 
by considering establishing BCT. Constraints (3) are the 
summation of direct for objective function k under scenario 
s. Constraints (4) are direct events for the objective func-
tion k and activity i under scenario s. Constraints (5) are a 
compact factor of activity i under scenario s by considering 
BCT. Constraints (6) are the summation of fixed costs for 
establishing BCT. Constraints (7) guarantee that start time 
equals zero for each scenario. Constraints (8) consider that 
finish time is less than the maximum defining time for each 
scenario. Constraints (9) indicate resource constraints for 
the proposed model. Constraints (10) express the duration 
of activity i between compact and normal time for each sce-
nario. Constraints (11) -(15) are predecessor and successor 
constraints for activities. Constraints (16), (17) are decision 
variables. Constraint (16) is a binary variable for running 
BCT in the project network. Constraints (17) are positive 
variables for activities’ start, duration, and finish time.
Preliminaries for linearization
The objective functions (1) are nonlinear and make the 
model mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). We 
transform them into mixed-integer programming (MIP) by 
mathematical method to improve time solution and solve

Linearizing max function:
Suppose: If � = max(Ωs) , then we can change � ≥ Ωs, ∀s.
Linearizing product binary with non-negative variable:
We can change and linearize a binary and a non-negative 
variable that is produced:
Suppose z = Ax , if A be a non-negative and positive vari-
able and x be binary variable. Therefore we can replace these 
constraints with the model (Glover 1975):
(16)xbt ∈ {0, 1},
(17)stis, xis, fis ≥ 0, ∀i, s.
(18)z ≥ 0,
(19)z ≤ Mx,

It means that if x be zero, z is zero-based on Eq. (18), (19). 
If x is 1, z is A based on Eqs. (20), (21).
Linearizing CVaR function:
We used CVaR as a coherent risk measure. Rockafellar 
and Uryasev (2000) designed the CVaR criterion for a novel 
embedded risk measure. CVaR (also known as the expected 
shortfall) is considered a measure for assessing the risk. CVaR 
is embedded in portfolio optimization to better risk manage-
ment (Kara et al. 2019; Lotfi et al. 2021a). This measure is the 
average of losses and is beyond the VaR point in confidence 
level. CVaR has a higher consistency, coherence, and conser-
vation than other risk-related criteria.

Linearization of RCTCQEETPBCTRR 
We used linearization by the operational research method. Solv-
ing the model by MIP is more straightforward than MINLP in 
the solver in Eqs. (25) to (36), and these methods decrease the 
time solution and the complexity of the model. We can write it 
as follows:

The complexity of linearization of RCTCQEETPBCTRR 
includes numbers of binary, positive, free variables, and con-
straints indicated in Eqs. (37) to (40). As can be seen, one of 
the essential factors for constraints, positive and free vari-
ables, is scenario sets. The relation between scenario and 
constraints, positive and free variables is linear.
We suggested scenario reduction and new algorithms for 
removing constraints and binary variables. This subject can 
help solve minimum time.

Results and discussion
This section surveys a healthcare project establishing a hos-
pital with 500 beds (c.f. Figure 3). Data and information 
received from managers of healthcare projects. In this com-
plex situation of COVID-19, we should run these hospitals 
as soon as possible in Iran.
Patients need beds for remedy. Therefore, we should establish 
a hospital with minimum cost, energy, environment, and maxi-
mum quality to provide patients with good quality. We show 
the network, predecessor, and activities’ successor in Fig. 4. 
The number of indices, constraints, variables, and parameters 
is defined for the case study in Tables 2 and 3.
We applied a computer with this configuration: CPU 
3.2 GHz, Processor Core i3-3210, 6.00 GB RAM, 64-bit oper-
ating system. Finally, we solve the mathematical models with 
GAMS-CPLEX solver. The results show that applying BCT 
decreases cost, energy, and pollution and increases quality, as 
shown in Tables 4 and 5, and Fig. 5. The total Gap between P1- 
RCTCQEETPBCTRR and without BCT is approximately 2.6%. 
Therefore, we suggest using and activating BCT to improve 
costs, quality, energy, and pollution. This subject increases resil-
iency and sustainability in project management and increases 
responsibility and agility between pillars of projects.
Variation in the Finish time
As can be seen, we surveyed and changed the finish time ( T ). 
When compacting finish time happens, costs, energy, and pollu-
tion increase, but quality decreases. It is entirely natural because 
by decreasing time, pushing project is occurred, therefore costs, 
energy, pollution (environment) increase, and finally we see the 
declining quality (cf. Figure 6 and Table 6).
Variation on the conservative coefficient
In this section, we do a variation on the conservative coefficient 
for decision-makers with risk-averse behavior until surveying 
the performance of the mathematical model. If the conservative 
coefficient increases to 100%, the cost, energy, and environment 
function functions grow, and quality decreases (cf. Table 7 and 
Fig. 7).
Variation on a confidence level of CVaR
In this section, we do a variation on the confidence level of 
CVaR for decision-makers with risk-averse behavior until

surveying the performance of the mathematical model. If 
the confidence level of CVaR changes between 1 and 5%, 
the cost, energy, and environment function functions grow 
up, and quality is approximately not changed (cf. Table 8, 
Fig. 8).
Variation in the number of scenarios
In this section, we do a variation on the number of scenarios for 
surveying the performance of the mathematical model. If the 
number of scenarios changes between 3 and 9, the cost function

decreases. Also, overall, quality and energy are declining, and 
environment function is increasing (cf. Table 9, Fig. 9).
Discussion
We cannot see RCTCQEETPBCTRR in the literature review 
when surveying related work. This mathematical model is the 
first time considered. In this section, we explore the RCTC-
QEETPBCTRR in healthcare projects. We try to show the appli-
cation of BCT in projects and show how it can help projects. 
We did sensitivity analysis on important parameters to show 
the model’s performance. Because the difference between this 
research and the literature review is hard compared with other 
related work. This research is the development of Lotfi et al. 
(2022c).
Eventually, we calculate RCTCQEETPBCTRR. We ana-
lyze the finish time, the conservative coefficient, the confi-
dence level of CVaR, and the number of scenarios. After 
solving the model, we receive these findings. The total gap 
between RCTCQEETPBCTRR and without BCT (Lotfi 
et al. 2022c) is approximately 2.6%. Therefore, using BCT 
is completely useful in project management. When compact-
ing finish time happens or if the conservative coefficient 
increases to 100%, costs, energy, and pollution environment 
increase, but quality decreases. If the confidence level of 
CVaR changes, the cost, energy, and environment function 
functions grow up, and quality is approximately not changed. 
Although, because of the difference between this research 
and the literature review, we cannot compare this research 
and try to compare only with Lotfi et al. (2022c).
Therefore, the results show that BCT increases project net-
work performance and resiliency. As a result, project managers 
should go fast to this novel technology and run projects as soon 
as possible. This technology increases resiliency and sustain-
ability in project management and increases responsibility and 
agility between pillars of the project.
Managerial insights and practical 
implications
This research focuses on the applicability of BCT in pro-
ject scheduling. We proposed a time–cost-quality-energy-
environment tradeoff by considering BCT. Applying BCT 
decreases cost, energy, and environmental (pollution) and 
increases quality. By using BCT, we can improve all objec-
tives by 2.6%. We suggest that all project managers embed 
novel technology like BCT into their projects to improve 
the performance of activities.
This research applies BCT as resiliency tools and con-
siders resource constraints related to network pillars as 
agility tools. Moreover, utilizing BCT increases resiliency, 
agility, and sustainability in the project management area. 
Resiliency and flexibility in facing costs by doing activi-
ties short and increasing transparency in transactions and 
exchange with vendors and suppliers with agility. BCT can 
help project management on digital record storage, digital 
asset exchange, acceptable conduct assurance, reputation 
building, and intelligent contract execution. BCT changes 
the environment of projects from passive to active and can 
implement strategic projects in organizations.

Therefore, as managers of projects, we should move and 
apply novel technology in projects until resiliency, sustainabil-
ity, and agility increase day by day. Applying and embedding 
BCT make to increase resiliency and sustainability in project 
management and increase responsibility and agility between 
pillars of the project.
Conclusions and outlook
The BCT is growing up day by day and entering the life 
of humans and projects. Researchers and investors need to 
use it in their work. Therefore, we proposed to utilize BCT 
in project management to witness the efficiency as much 
as possible. In this research, we suggested using BCT and 
showed a mathematical model. We employed BCT as resil-
iency tools and considered resource constraints related to 
network pillars as agility constraints.
We used a robust hybrid optimization by considering 
a risk-averse approach for modeling RCTCQEETP. We 
applied weighted expected value, minimax, and CVaR 
for all objective functions for robustness and risk-averse 
against disruption with the worst condition.
The findings of this research are as follows:
1. The results show that applying BCT decreases cost, 
energy, and pollution and increases quality, as shown 
in Tables 4 and 5, and Fig. 5. The total gap between 
RCTCQEETPBCTRR and without BCT is approxi-
mately 2.6%. Therefore, we suggest using and activating 
BCT to improve cost, quality, energy, and environment.
2. When compacting finish time happens, costs, energy, 
and pollution increase, but quality decreases. It is 
entirely natural because by decreasing time, pushing 
project is occurred, therefore costs, energy, pollution 
environment increase, and finally we see the declining 
quality (cf. Figure 6 and Table 6).
3. We analyze variation on the conservative coefficient for 
decision-makers with risk-averse behavior. If the conserva-
tive coefficient increases to 100%, the cost, energy, and envi-
ronment function grow, and quality decreases (cf. Table 7 
and Fig. 7).

of scenarios

4. We do a variation on the confidence level of CVaR for 
decision-makers with risk-averse behavior. If the con-
fidence level of CVaR increases, the cost, energy, and 
environment function functions grow up, and quality is 
approximately not changed (cf. Table 8, Fig. 8).
5. Finally, we presented a variation on the number of sce-
narios for surveying the performance of the mathemati-
cal model. If the number of scenarios changes from 3 
to 9, the cost function decreases. Also, overall, quality 
and energy are declining, and environment function is 
increasing (cf. Table 9, Fig. 9).
One of the research constraints is solving the model on a 
large scale. Because of the existence of MILP, we suggest 
using a new exact algorithm like Benders decomposition, 
Lagrange relaxation, and column generation (Lotfi et al. 
2021c). Moreover, using heuristic and metaheuristic algo-
rithms (Peng et al. 2022) is advantageous for solving mini-
mum time and gaining near-optimal solutions.
Embedding other methods to cope with uncertainty like 
fuzzy (Kropat & Weber 2018), robust convex (Lotfi et al. 
2022b), and hybrid data-driven robust optimization (Lotfi 
et al. 2022a) is an exciting approach for researchers. Using 
risk coherent risk criteria like Entropic VaR (EVaR), Robust 
CVaR (RCVaR) (Dixit & Tiwari 2020; Li et al. 2021) is a 
very excitable contribution. Therefore, we proposed to utilize 
novel technology in project management like the Internet of 
Things (IoT), 3D printing, and BCT to increase performance, 
resiliency, sustainability, and agility.
