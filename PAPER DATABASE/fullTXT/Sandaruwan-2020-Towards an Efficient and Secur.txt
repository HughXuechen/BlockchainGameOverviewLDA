Towards an Efficient and Secure Blood Bank Management System
 
   Towards an Efficient and Secure Blood 
Bank Management System 
Abstract— a blood bank plays an important role in a hospital as 
well as in a country, ensuring safe and timely blood transfusions. 
However, there are several challenges faced by blood banks 
around the world, specifically when securing the blood supply 
chain. Reducing the supply-demand imbalance, protecting the 
data privacy of donors as well as receivers, are some of them. 
Therefore, there is a timely requirement for an effective and 
secure management system for the blood bank. 
We have proposed a management platform for the blood 
bank operations with the following modules: (1) forecast blood 
demand, (2) suggest blood donation campaign locations and (3) 
secure blood supply chain. The proposed platform has been 
implemented using techniques such as Long Short-Term 
Memory (LSTM), k-means clustering, Geographic Information 
Systems (GIS), and blockchain. Our results show that using our 
proposed modules, we can minimize the imbalance between 
supply and demand of blood, find the most suitable donor in an 
emergency, and enhance the privacy of data.

I. INTRODUCTION  
 Human blood is a vitally important fluid in the body that 
circulates through our body and delivers essential substances 
like oxygen and nutrients to the body’s cells. Hence, it is one 
of the most in-demand medical resources in the world [1]. 
Blood transfusion is mostly required in surgeries, organ 
transplants, and childbirths and for patients who are receiving 
treatments for diseases such as cancers, dengue, and anemia. 
Blood banking is the process that takes place in the lab to 
make sure that donated blood, or blood products, are safely 
stored before they are used in blood transfusions and other 
medical procedures.  
 According to [1], about 36,000 units of blood are needed 
every day, and about 6.8 million volunteer donor blood each 
year that results in 13.6 million blood units’ donations per 
year. Therefore, a blood bank plays an important role in a 
hospital as well as in a country, ensuring safe and timely 
blood transfusions. 
The first aspect of blood bank management is to accurately 
forecast future blood unit requirements and reduce blood 
demand and supply imbalance in the health sector. It will 
result in reducing the blood unit shortage and also blood 
wastage (i.e., decrease the overstocking of blood). Therefore, 
having a mechanism to forecast blood demand, specifically 
for each blood type, is an important aspect of conserving the 
valuable blood resource.  
 The second aspect of blood bank management is to plan 
blood donation campaigns effectively and timely so that a 
high number of blood donors can gather for the donation 
process. In the current context, the organizers of the blood 
donation campaign find it difficult to select the most effective 
place to have the donation campaign. There are campaigns 
with fewer donors, and campaigns with higher donors and 
campaigns that have fewer donors are not very effective. 
Therefore, suggesting the most effective area where it is most 
likely to be able to gather many donors who are willing to 
donate blood, results in conducting an effective blood 
donation campaign. 
 The third aspect of blood bank management is to ensure 
a secure blood supply chain. Every blood transfusion process 
faces two security challenges. First, preserving the 
confidentiality of donors’ and receivers’ data privacy, so that 
sensitive data is not disclosed to unauthorized personal. 
Second, ensuring the integrity of blood transfusion requests, 
so that fake blood transfusion requests are avoided. 
Therefore, maintaining confidentiality and integrity during 
the blood transfusion process will ensure a secure blood 
supply chain. 
 In this research, we have proposed a platform for 
efficient and secure blood bank management with the 
following modules: (1) forecasting blood demand, (2) 
suggesting blood donation campaign locations, and (3) 
securing the blood supply chain. The proposed platform has 
been implemented using techniques such as Long Short-Term 
Memory (LSTM), k-means clustering, Geographic 
Information Systems (GIS), and block-chain. We have 
consulted and visited the Blood Bank of Sri Lanka and 
doctors to identify the factors contributing to the above-
mentioned activities and collect related data. We have 
conducted experiments to measure the performances of our 
algorithms using the Blood Bank of Sri Lanka as a case study. 
We have evaluated our system using real data sets, and in this 
paper, we are presenting the performance of our system. Our 
results show that using our proposed modules, we can 
minimize the imbalance between the supply and demand of

blood, by predicting the demand patterns for the next 6 
months, and by scheduling the blood donation campaigns 
effectively. It also enhances the security of the blood supply 
chain by ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of data. 
 The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II 
presents the related work. Section III introduces the four 
modules of the blood bank management platform. In section 
IV, the result and discussions are presented. Final Remarks 
and References are mentioned in Section V and VI, 
respectively. 
 
II. RELATED WORK 
Blood bank management is an essential component of 
most of the hospital management activities, but 
unfortunately, there are only a few research works have been 
conducted in this field. In this section, we will discuss the 
existing work on blood bank management related activities.  
The first aspect of blood bank management is, 
forecasting the blood demand. The study in [2] shows that 
accurate blood demand forecasting will results in lowering 
costs, reduction of blood wastage, and conservation of 
limited resources in blood banks. They have used multiple 
approaches to predict blood demand, and their study 
concludes that the Box–Jenkins methodology gave the most 
accurate results. The authors of [3] conducted a forecasting 
analysis of blood components using POM-QM Software. The 
POM-QM software selected the method with the smallest 
number of errors of forecasting results using four methods: 
moving average, weighted moving average, exponential 
smoothing, and exponential smoothing with the trend. The 
work on [4] has used Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to 
predict the demand of blood components and their results 
show that the ANN-based model gives better results than the 
Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) 
model. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a special 
kind of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and has been used 
in several forecasting related research work because they are 
capable of learning long term dependencies [14-18]. 
The second aspect of blood bank management is to 
suggest more effective areas to conduct blood donation 
campaigns, by clustering donors’ locations. The authors of 
[5], have used a k-means algorithm-based approach to 
conduct a blood donation information analysis. They propose 
to improve the accuracy of the k-means algorithm by 
increasing the accuracy in the calculation of the initial 
centroids. The study on [6] uses a k-means algorithm-based 
clustering method to describe blood donor behaviors. They 
have varied the value of k to have a different number of 
clusters and used Dunn's index for distinguishing the optimal 
number of clusters. The authors of [7] developed a system 
using clustering and classification algorithms to determine 
the disparities in blood donation behavior among the present 
donors. Further, they predict donors’ intentions towards a 
donation to understand the problems and to increase 
voluntary blood donation frequency. 
The third aspect of blood bank management is to ensure 
a secure blood supply chain. Blockchain technology is an 
emerging technology for securing supply chain data, and 
therefore, there are several on-going types of research works 
on using blockchain concepts to secure the blood supply 
chain. The work in [8] presents a framework that could be 
used for the implementation of blockchain technology in the 
healthcare sector for Electronic Health Record (EHR). Their 
framework aims to provide secure storage of electronic 
records by defining granular access rules for the users. The 
authors of [9] use blockchain to secure blood donor’s 
information and to provide traceability and transparency of 
information in distributing blood packs. A serial number of 
the blood packet, which was issued by blood banks, will be 
stored in the blockchain, and once the blood bags are used, 
blood donors will receive the notification. The work on [10] 
has implemented a blood cold chain system based on private 
blockchain technology to achieve two goals: secure 
information visibility and reduce blood supply time. They 
show that the system prevents forgery and information 
tampering, which makes the blood management operation 
more transparent. Also, their system has the significance of 
reducing the blood supply time. 
 Our research has been inspired by these works, and we 
are targeting to build a single platform to handle blood bank 
related activities securely and efficiently. 
 
III. METHODOLOGY 
AIMA is a Web-based application that is intended to store, 
measure, recover, and investigate data worried about the 
managerial and stock administration inside a blood bank. We 
have proposed a platform for efficient and secure blood bank 
management with the following modules: (1) forecasting 
blood demand, (2) suggesting blood donation campaign 
locations, and (3) securing the blood supply chain. 
 
A. Forecasting blood demand 
The main goals of the blood demand forecasting module 
were to identify the most accurate model for blood demand 
prediction and then to calculate the required blood amount in 
the future. We have consulted the Blood Bank of Sri Lanka 
and doctors to identify the factors contributing to blood 
demand and to collect related data. The data set we used for 
the prediction included the date of the month and blood units 
count. First, the collected data were cleaned and preprocessed 
using Pandas and numpy libraries. Table I shows a sub-set of 
the data set we used for predicting the blood demand. It 
includes the date and number of blood units issued for each 
blood group. Next, the forecasting problem was modeled 
such that, when the issued blood count and relevant dates 
were given, it forecasts the blood demand for the next six 
months. 
We used the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model 
for the blood demand forecasting problem. The LSTMs are a 
special kind of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and they 
are capable of learning long term dependencies [11-13]. All 
RNNs have the form of a chain of repeating modules of 
neural networks. As shown in Figure 1, in standard RNNs, 
this repeating module will have a very simple structure, such 
as a single tanh layer.

TABLE I: Blood demand prediction – a subset of the data set 
 
LSTMs also form in a chain-like structure, but the repeating 
module organizes differently. In an LSTM network, a module 
may have four neural network layers with three gates. The 
structure of a standard LSTM cell is shown in Figure 2. 
 
Fig 1: Standard simple RNN cell structure  [12] 
 
Fig 2: Standard LSTM cell structure  [12] 
First, the data was feature normalized as input set, X: 
{date, issued blood count for specific blood group} and 
output set, Y: {blood_demand_for_specific_blood_group}. 
Second, to fit an LSTM on the multivariate input data, the 
data was split into “Train set” (99.8%) and “Test set” 
(0.02%). Next, the data was fetched into Keras LSTM 
network with 1000 initial neurons and 1 output node.  
We used the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) loss function 
and the efficient Adam version of stochastic gradient descent 
as evaluation models.  The batch processing ran for 180 
epochs (iterations) with a batch-size of 4. We explored both 
the training and test losses during training by setting the 
validation_data argument in the fit function.  
Finally, we combined the forecast with the test dataset 
and invert the scaling. With forecasts and actual values in 
their original scale, we calculated an error score for the 
model. In this case, we calculated the Root Mean Squared      
Error (RMSE) that gives error in the same units as the 
variable itself. 
B. Suggesting blood donation campaigns locations 
The main goal of suggesting blood donation campaign 
locations module is to explore locations that have the 
possibility of gathering more donors and to conduct more 
effective donation campaigns in those locations. We have 
used the K-means clustering algorithm to cluster donors 
based on their residential addresses, and find the highest 
density cluster, which can be considered as the perfect 
location for the donation campaign. 
K-means clustering is a type of unsupervised learning, 
which is used when you have unlabeled data (i.e., data 
without defined categories or groups) [19-21]. The goal of 
this algorithm is to find groups in the data, with the number 
of groups represented by the variable K. K-means, works as 
an iterative algorithm that tries to partition the dataset into K 
number of (K is pre-defined) distinct non-overlapping 
subgroups (clusters), where each data point belongs to only 
one group. It tries to make the intra-cluster data points as 
similar as possible while also keeping the clusters as different 
(far) as possible. 
The K-means algorithm can be described by the following 
four key steps [19]: 
1. Initialize cluster centers (centroids) (Ex: randomly 
select K points as centers). 
2. Assign observations (data points) to the closest 
centroid. 
3. Revise centroids as a means of assigned observations. 
4. Repeat from step 1 to 3, until there is no change to the 
centroids 
 
We have consulted the Blood Bank of Sri Lanka and 
doctors to identify the locations of donors and collect related 
data. In our implementation, we have assumed K to be 50 and, 
we have clustered donors into 50 clusters. First, the 
residential addresses of donors are converted into location 
information: longitudes and latitude [22]. Therefore, each 
donor’s location is represented as {latitude, longitude} [23]. 
Second, we select 50 centroids: 50 locations where blood 
campaigns are held frequently. Third, the donors are divided 
into 50 clusters, each donor is assigned to the closest cluster. 
Finally, we revise the centroids, by taking the average of all 
donors’ locations (longitude and latitude), that belong to each 
cluster, as given in Equation (1) and (2). These steps are 
repeated until we reach for a converged set of centroids.

(locations of donors) are displayed on a map to provide better 
output [24].  
 
C. Securing the blood supply chain  
The main goals of securing the blood supply chain are to 
preserve the confidentiality of donors’ and receivers’ data 
privacy, so that sensitive data is not disclosed to an 
unauthorized person, and ensure the integrity of blood 
transfusion requests so that fake blood transfusion requests 
are avoided. 
In an emergency, if a patient requires a blood transfusion, 
the doctor submits a “blood transfusion request form” with 
confidential details of the patient [25]. The form includes a 
unique ID (patient ID), blood type, reason for blood request, 
if any diseases, and contact details of the patient, etc. Once 
the form is filled, it is submitted to the blood bank of the 
hospital, and then the blood bank issues a blood packet for a 
given patient ID.  
In our proposed blood bank management platform, we have 
allowed hospital management to register their hospital with a 
set of credentials. Once the hospital is registered on our 
platform, an authorized user can submit the blood transfusion 
request form, which includes a patient’s sensitive data. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We have used blockchain technology to preserve the 
confidentiality and integrity of patient’s sensitive data. A 
blockchain is a distributed copy of the database or a ledger in 
a network, where information stored in the ledger is made up 
of blocks and linked together in a chain [26]. Each block is 
connected to all the blocks before and after it – in a series of 
records. The records on a blockchain are stored securely 
through a cryptographic hash function.  Each member in the 
blockchain network owns a full copy of the ledger. This 
makes it difficult to alter a record in blockchain and it 
provides the confidentiality and integrity features to data 
stored in blocks. Therefore, in our proposed system, we have 
stored the blood transfusion request form details, using the 
blockchain concept.  
Furthermore, we have used the smart contract concept of 
blockchain to handle blood transfusion requests. A smart 
contract is a piece of code that contains specific terms that are 
executed when triggered by specific agreed events and stored 
inside a blockchain. Smart contracts run on the blockchain 
directly, thus making themselves secure from any kind of 
tampering and alterations. Whenever a blood transfusion 
request is submitted, the details of the form are passed using 
a smart contract. There are two smart contracts involved here; 
hospital and blood bank. If the blood transfusion is approved, 
blood packets will be allocated as requested, and the allocated 
blood packets will be identified by an ID. The ID of the 
allocated blood packets is also passed to the user who 
requested the blood transfusion, using a smart contract. Other 
than those concepts, a delegate call is introduced here for the 
connection between two smart contracts. 
 
IV.    EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS 
 In this section, we are presenting the results and 
observations of the following modules: (1) forecasting blood 
demand, (2) suggesting blood donation campaign locations, 
and (3) securing the blood supply chain. 
A successful blood management system works through an 
evidence-based approach to optimize patient safety and 
improve management and outcomes through measurable 
enhancements We have consulted the Blood Bank of Sri 
Lanka and doctors to identify the factors contributing to the 
above-mentioned activities and collect related data. We have 
conducted experiments to measure the performances of our 
algorithms using the Blood Bank of Sri Lanka as a case study. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A. Forecasting blood demand 
For the blood demand prediction module, we ran the blood 
demand prediction LSTM network for 180 iterations with the 
blood demand prediction dataset for each blood group 
separately.

of actual values and predicted values for test data set for all 
types of blood groups, as a result of the blood demand 
prediction. Table II shows RMSE values given by the blood 
demand prediction model for each blood group type when 
using a 98.2% train set and 0.2% test set.  
 
B. Suggesting blood donation campaigns locations 
For the suggesting blood donation campaign locations 
module, we have used the K-means algorithm where we 
assumed K to be 50. We have selected 50 initial centroids, 
which are the 50 locations that hold blood campaigns 
frequently. We have used {longitude, latitude} of each 
donors’ location as data points for the algorithm. With the k-
means clustering algorithm, we have clustered all donors into 
50 clusters. The results of our clustering algorithm are 
visualized in Figure 4. High-density clusters represent 
locations that have more donors, and low-density clusters 
represent locations that have fewer donors. Therefore, by 
analyzing the cluster densities, our system can suggest 
locations that are likely to have more blood donors.  
The geo-informatics of the above-formed clusters are 
shown in Figure 4 Each cluster is indexed using a cluster 
label. Also, the resultant {longitude, latitude} represents the 
centroid of each cluster, which represents the locations to be 
considered as blood donation campaign locations as in table 
III.

C. Securing the blood supply chain 
For the securing blood supply chain module, we have used 
blockchain technology and its concept of the smart contract. 
All the sensitive data of the blood transfusion request form is 
stored in blocks, and they are secured through cryptographic 
hash functions. Therefore, view the actual stored patient and 
blood packet data can be seen as in table IV, where details in 
Etherscan will see is a meaningless set of data as in figure 5 
which contains the details of the same transaction which can 
be confirmed using transaction hash and contract address in

The hospital ID is equal to the hospital ID where the patient 
details are passing from. therefore the transaction is made 
from that particular hospital to the blood bank. Then when it 
requests to the blood bank, a blood packet id (dinNo) can 
assign to that particular patient ID. 
 
 
V. CONCLUSION 
 We have proposed a platform for efficient and secure 
blood bank management with the following modules: (1) 
forecasting blood demand, (2) suggesting blood donation 
campaign locations, and (3) securing the blood supply chain. 
The proposed platform has been implemented using 
techniques such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), k-
means clustering, Geographic Information system (GIS), and 
blockchain. We have evaluated our system using real data 
sets, and our results show that using our proposed modules, 
we can minimize the imbalance between the supply and 
demand of blood. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model 
was used for the blood demand forecasting problem, which is 
an artificial recurrent neural network architecture used in the 
field of deep learning to provide an accurate blood demand 
prediction. Other than that this helps for scheduling the blood 
donation campaigns effectively. From this, it can visualize a 
large number of data points simultaneously on a map through 
google map APIs.which is important to find blood campaign 
locations in real-time. It also enhances the security of the 
blood supply chain by ensuring the confidentiality and 
integrity of data. Furthermore, we introduce the smart 
contract for blockchain-based healthcare systems which is 
key for defining the pre-defined agreements among various 
involved stakeholders. 
  As future work, we are planning to implement a 
module to find the best donors for specific blood transfusion 
requirements, especially in emergencies. We are planning to 
consider factors such as donor’s age, the most recent time of 
blood donation and distance to hospital, etc. Also further for 
the human organ donation.
