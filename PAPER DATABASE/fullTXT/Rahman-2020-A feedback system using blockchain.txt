Abstract​— ​Blockchain has emerged as a new light in         
the digital world. Though this technology is one of         
the newest inventions, it has widened the doors of         
security and transparency in the technology-based      
world. Stakeholder’s feedback brings out more      
opportunities in an organization. But it is not easy to          
find honest feedback since people may feel hesitation        
to give an honest review for many reasons like safety,          
bias, nepotism, etc. Today mostly a database system        
is used to store the data of feedback, but lack of trust            
in the database system leads to false feedback or         
partially compromised feedback. In this paper, a       
digital feedback system will be used where feedback        
will be ensured with the anonymity of the users. This          
system will make sure the trust of users is being          
stalled when feedback is given. Furthermore, it will        
give an idea of how the people of an organization          
think about certain topics. This system can be a         
game-changer in the corporate world as well.

I. I​NTRODUCTION 
In the days of globalization, feedback is an essential part          
of any organization, whether it is based on business or          
educational purposes. To know the possible solution to        
any obstacle in organizations, feedback is being       
maintained. Since the introduction of a feedback system        
through a database, it has been accepted widely. People         
thought that it’s a solution to the problems of lack of           
communication among the people in an organization.       
That is why, the feedback is taken with greater         
significance. When an employee gives feedback, the       
Human Resource (HR) department takes the feedback       
seriously from the employees for future updates. As in         
this case, some feedback can be negative for certain         
people in a company. But When the HR department         
brings the matter in a meeting, they come to know about           
the feedback that was given by employees. Some people         
tend to search those who have given them negative         
feedback and they might know this through the system         
admin from the database. Thus, the feedback doesn’t        
remain anonymous anymore. In recent years, people find        
its difficulties to keep it secret. So at this point, it can be             
said that the feedback system is not anonymous in the          
database management system[13]. Here we are      
proposing a feedback system that will give the user the          
anonymity they all wanted in a feedback related system.         
We will evaluate the system in detail which will be done           
using blockchain technology. 
A system that ensures the records of information        
that is almost unlikely to change, break, or cheat is the           
main concept of the blockchain. A modern ledger of         
transactions is being duplicated and distributed across       
the nodes of the network which essentially refers to the          
blockchain technology[2,9]. 
In blockchain blocks which are created using a        
growing list of recorded information are linked through        
cryptography[10]. The cryptographic hash of the      
previous block, timestamp, and transition data are       
contained in each block. 
Global supply chains, financial services,     
healthcare, agriculture, and many other industries use the        
blockchain as a descriptor. For the betterment of the         
students, universities are also using a student feedback        
system that analyzes the performances of teachers on        
different courses and it is a decentralized platform which         
is made using blockchain technology. 
 
                      II. L​ITERATURE​ R​EVIEW 
Satoshi Nakamoto invented a digital     
cryptocurrency named bitcoin back in 2008[1]. A paper        
was published on blockchain technology to act as the         
public transaction ledger which led to a cryptocurrency        
called bitcoin. Based on this technology a new door was          
opened for various purposes.

A feedback system is largely based on privacy        
and anonymity. With the help of blockchain technology        
along with their many fascinating attributes such as        
anonymity, verifiability, robustness, and even possibly      
privacy; a feedback system can be created. The feedback         
is also auditable due to the distributed nature of a          
blockchain[13]. 
 In the end, it is possible to make a feedback          
platform using blockchain technology. The platform      
inherits many desirable blockchain attributes and could       
be modified or extended to fit the different other         
business applications in future with similar requirements       
such as privacy, the form of institutional feedback, or         
even e-voting[2].  
In 2018, Jerome Mizzi and Frankie Inguanez       
searched for possible solutions for national e-voting       
systems using modern technology like blockchain[17].      
They made a prototype and created a website and used          
smart contracts on the blockchain. Their main goal was         
to ensure honesty in the counting of votes as well as           
maintaining the privacy and safety of the voting. Since         
the time blockchain was launched to make       
cryptocurrency, it has now been explored in many        
innovative ways. In this system, they initiate a system         
where internal tampering can be nullified and perform a         
secure trusted voting protocol. 
In 2018, Yi Liu and Qi Wang looked for         
increased honesty in voting where they encrypted the        
ballot’s content with the help of blockchain e-voting and         
ensured secrecy to the voters so that they can not be           
marked out[3]. They also ensured the voting speed and         
security measurements with the help of private       
blockchain. 
In 2019, Chang-Hyun Roh and Im-Yeong Lee       
looked for increased honesty in voting where they        
encrypted the ballot’s content with the help of the         
blockchain[16]. They also ensured the voting speed and        
security measurements with the help of the private        
blockchain. This system would ensure the following       
entity- the manager of voting, the voting, and the         
counting server and they presumed all the participants        
are in a secure transmission. 
In those papers, researchers are interested in an        
internet-based voting system that ensures data security       
and the vote casting ensuring. In this research paper, a          
feedback-based system will be introduced where one can        
give one’s feedback and nobody will know who delivers         
this feedback which is somewhat similar to the voting         
system. 
 
              ​   III.  BLOCKCHAIN 
Bitcoin is the first application of blockchain that took         
place in blockchain technology[1] [2] and changed the        
outcome of the future of cryptocurrency. 
Blockchain is classified and characterized by      
various kinds. In Table 1 three kinds of classifications         
and their characteristics are shown. 
 
Table 1: Classifications and characteristics of Blockchain[18] 
 
 
The blockchain contains some important properties      
which are: distributed data sharing, immutability, data       
persistence, autonomous code execution, accountability     
and transparency, data provenance[15].

distributed across multiple nodes. The protocol ensures       
that data inserted in a particular node gets synced across          
all nodes in a timely fashion. 
ii) Immutability: Data immutability in blockchain comes       
from the fact that to change data inserted in a previous           
block where an attacker must possess either significant        
computational power, in case of a public blockchain. It         
also comprises most of the nodes in any type of          
blockchain. 
iii) Data persistence: A distributed system works in a         
way that data in a blockchain will persist as long as there            
are enough nodes to execute the protocol in a secure          
way. 
iv) Autonomous code execution: A smart-contract will       
ease the autonomous code execution without a single        
point of failure. 
v) Accountability and transparency: All permitted      
entities can verify every single transaction which can        
make sure accountability and transparency. 
vi) Data provenance: Data in a blockchain can only be          
stored with a signed transaction which ensures data        
provenance[15]. 
 
 
         ​Figure 1. Properties of  Blockchain [7] 
 
Since we know blockchain is a distributed network that         
is decentralized in structure, pointers and linked lists are         
used in blockchain architecture[14]. 
i) Pointers: The location of another variable is kept in          
this variable. This basically points to the position of         
other variables. 
ii) Linked Lists: It refers to a sequence of blocks where           
each and every block contains some information and        
links to the next block using a pointer. 
 
      Figure 2. Architecture of Blockchain[7] 
 
For example, bitcoin is being created with this        
technology. It is mainly a data structure that is ordered          
and it contains blocks of transactions where every block         
in the chain is necessarily linked to the block stored          
before. 
The block which is initially kept there is known         
as the primary block which is the foundation of the          
stack. New blocks are kept on top of the previous          
blocks, thus it forms a stack which is known as the           
blockchain[9,10]. 
A block mainly consists of data where       
transactions, hash, previous hash, nonce, timestamp are       
included. A hash placed on the header identifies each         
block in the stack. This hash uses the secure hash          
Algorithm called (SHA-256) which generates the      
idiosyncratic fixed-size 256-bit hash. Plain text will be        
used as an input in the algorithm SHA-256 and will be           
encrypted to a 256-byte binary value. 
Hashing is a one-way function. A figure that describes         
the basic logic of this encryption is shown below. 
 
 
Figure 3. Representation of  SHA-256 algorithm 
 
The blocks are created when a valid transaction        
is occurred in the blockchain. Transaction details are        
updated in each block which is also linked with the hash           
value of the previous block to establish blocks in the          
chain. 
The encrypted hash in its header is the primary         
identifier. Another figure which shows a new block        
creation that contains the hash value is added below.         
After creating a new block, it is transmitted to the          
blockchain. The system keeps on tracking the incoming        
new blocks and updates them on the blockchain.

IV. SYSTEM FRAMEWORK 
The main vision of this system is to give feedback and           
remain anonymous. The discussion of the requirements       
and system functionalities are given below. 
4.1 System Requirements: This feedback system      
includes the requirements below: 
Authentication: Registered users will get the opportunity       
to give their feedback. 
Anonymity: The system will make sure the anonymity        
of the identity so that nobody can find the actual person. 
Validity: Every feedback must be counted and validate        
it. Once the feedback is done, it cannot be changed or           
removed. 
Checkable: The system will ensure the right person will         
get the feedback given to him[1]. 
 
4.2 System Representation: 
 
Figure 5.​ ​System Representation 
 
4​.2.1 Registration Policy: The user will have to login to          
the feedback system using his identity number, name, or         
contact number. The system will check the given        
information if it is matched with a valid user; the system           
will give the clearance to enter the feedback system. Our          
system will not allow self-registration to avoid fake        
users and their feedback. 
4.2.2 Giving Feedback: Users will give their feedback         
to the given candidate. The interface that will be used          
here must be user friendly. 
4.2.3 Feedback Encryption: When the user will be done         
with their feedback, the input including the user id         
number and the name will be generated by the system          
along with the hash of the previous feedback. 
So in this way, the uniqueness of the input as well as the             
encrypted output will be ensured every single time. The         
Block header will record the encrypted information.       
Each block’s information will be encrypted by SHA-256        
which is a hash function of one way that disallows the           
reversion or decryption to date. This way of hashing         
ensures that reverse engineering is impossible so that the         
user’s information is secured and cannot be regained. 
4.2.4 Adding the feedback to the Blockchain: After the         
creation of the block, information of the dependent        
candidate for feedback is recorded in the corresponding        
blockchain. Each block is connected with the previous        
block which is referred to as shackles of blocks. [10] 
This system will contain a chain for each user for          
feedback and orphan blocks will not be a problem for          
this system since they possess identical information       
(feedback) like the other block. 
 
         V. CONCLUSION 
In the end, this research paper talks about the         
importance of gaining trust among the feedback       
system’s users and making feedback a lot easier and         
ensuring transparency. It gives the corporate world and        
institutions a new door of opportunity to understand the         
user’s expectations from their organization. Through this       
system, feedback will be more honest and reliable to get          
an opinion on a given candidate. In terms of limitations,          
we can think of hackers attacking a user’s device to          
manipulate the feedback. Also, feedback can be done        
once in a period, so that multiple feedback for one          
candidate can not be possible[1]. This feedback system        
can be used in Rating based companies like Fico run for           
the apartment’s rent.[11] Even it can be used in         
educational institution’s ratings, share markets, etc. 
Even though the feedback system brings out a        
lot of positivity, it may cause some negativity while         
giving feedback since every user remains anonymous.       
Some users can intentionally give negative feedback to        
ruin the reputation of a candidate. Since our system will          
be maintained through the blockchain, therefore, the       
transaction rate will be slow. Even if one node is          
damaged in a distributive ledger, the entire data of that          
node will be damaged and can not be retrieved. We also           
need to remain conscious of memory size, since data         
will be bigger day by day. In the future, to a greater            
extent, this research can lead to a feedback-based point         
system which will pave the way for finding qualities of
