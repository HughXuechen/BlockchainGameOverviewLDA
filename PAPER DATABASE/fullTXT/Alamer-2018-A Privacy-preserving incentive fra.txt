Abstract—In this paper, we introduce a promising secure and
privacy-preserving incentive mechanism in the vehicular cloud
(VC). Such an incentive will convince vehicles with excess sensing
data to join in the VC without the risk of privacy disclosure.
The proposed scheme uses the Bargain Game theory to model
the interactions between a VC server (VCS) and vehicles. With
the proposed incentive mechanism, the VCS can select competent
vehicles with which to collaborate for the announced task, while
the vehicles can earn payment for participation. Further, our
mechanism ensures fairness between all participants in terms of
reward. We also exploit the signcryption technique to achieve
mutual authentication between the VCS and vehicles as well
as to prevent the private information of these vehicles from
being disclosed. Simulation results are provided to show that the
proposed privacy-preserving incentive mechanism is beneficial to
both the VCS and vehicles, resulting in a win-win situation.

I. INTRODUCTION
A great deal of attention has been recently directed towards
the vehicular cloud (VC), which is considered as a promising
paradigm that plays a critical role in data generation where
a large number of smart vehicles collect various kinds of
sensing data with large-volume features [1]. The key point
of the VC paradigm is to collect and utilize excess vehicle
resources in a dynamic group of vehicles under the vehicle
owners’ authorization [13]. By using the vehicles’ sensing
resources, the VC becomes increasingly ideal for its ability
to support many applications with more accuracy and useful
services compared with other mobile crowdsensing paradigms
[2].
While the information that should be collected from vehi-
cles’ sensor devices is essential for the success of VC appli-
cations, there still exists significant challenges that hinder the
rapid development of VCs. The first challenge is to stimulate
interest in vehicle owners to utilize their vehicles’ sensing
data to initiate information exchange with VCs in a dynamic
environment. This is because vehicle owners may incur extra
operational costs when providing their sensing data to the
VC. Thus, they have control over whether they keep sensing
data or rent it for economically appealing compensation [13].
This results in the second challenge of selecting vehicles and
determining their strategies while ensuring fairness among
them. The third challenge concerns the security and privacy
preserving issues of the involved vehicles in the VC. For ex-
ample, the vehicle owners may be concerned about the privacy
of their information, such as location during participation.
Although a number of works that use game theory, such as
Stackelberg, encourage vehicle owners to share their sensing
data in a VC system [3] [4], they still do not adequately
consider the problem of how to protect the privacy of the
involved vehicles and how to evaluate the vehicles’ sensing
resources in terms of reward. For instance, exiting works
provide fixed monetary rewards for performing a task but with
no guarantee of fairness among vehicles.
This means that vehicle that provides a large number of
sensing resources will obtain the same compensation as those
which provide fewer resources. Vehicle owners may seek to
maximize their profit by providing a different number of
sensing resources. Due to the fact that there are different
sensor devices in a vehicle, each vehicle can be categorized
as a different sensing resource according to their application
domains [5]. For instance, environmental conditions such as
weather status, street images, and traffic conditions can be
categorized as different sensing resources that are detected
by different sensor devices in the vehicle. The data that are
collected by the sensors is totally different from each other in
terms of information and social cost. Thus, we cannot merely
compensate vehicles that provides a large number of sensing
resources in the same way as those which provide fewer
resources. Moreover, we cannot provide equal compensation
for vehicles that provide their resources in the desired time
period with those that are delayed. Schemes that administer a
fixed reward cannot penalize vehicles that delay the provision
of their resources during the required period. These schemes
forfeit fairness and correctness amongst vehicles in terms of
reward. This has encouraged us to create a mechanism that is
capable of evaluating vehicle resources in order to guarantee
fairness and correctness between vehicles.
In this paper, we present a design for a secure and privacy-
preserving incentive mechanism to motivate vehicle owners
to share their collected sensing resources in the VC without
disclosing any privacy-related information. Different from
previous works [3] [4], our work builds a secure and privacy-
preserving incentive mechanism based on evaluating vehicle

sensing resources. To be more precise, the main contributions
of this paper are as follows:
Firstly, we introduce a vehicular sensing resource evaluation
mechanism that is described by our expressive language as a
novel approach to guarantee a fairness evaluation for vehicles’
sensing resources.
Secondly, by exploiting the Bargain Game model, we pro-
pose an incentive mechanism that is compatible with our
evaluation mechanism to model the interactions between the
VCS and vehicles. A role-based bargain approach, which is
more targeted and dynamic, can let the price of the sensing
resources be more accurate and result in high welfare for both
parties. Thus, the proposed scheme is capable of describing
the amount of sensing data provided by each vehicle.
Thirdly, we exploit the signcryption technique to propose
a privacy-preserving scheme to prevent the private informa-
tion of vehicles from being disclosed and to achieve mutual
authentication between the VCS and vehicles.
Finally, we conduct a numerical analysis to validate the
effectiveness of our privacy-preserving incentive model. The
results show that the incentive mechanism works effectively
and guarantees fairness among vehicles in terms of rewards.
Moreover, the privacy-preserving protocol is much more effi-
cient in terms of computational costs and ciphertext size.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec-
tion II, we introduce the system and attack model, and identify
the design goals followed by a presentation of preliminaries in
Section III. In Section IV, we discuss our privacy-preserving
incentive mechanism. A security analysis and performance
evaluation are described in Section V and VI, respectively.
Finally, we draw our conclusions in Section VII.
II. SYSTEM MODEL, ATTACK MODEL AND DESIGN GOALS
In this section, we introduce the system model, present the
attack model, and identify the design goals.
A. System Model
We consider a general VC request system. As shown in
Fig.1, the system model consists of a VCS, a roadside unit
(RSU) and a number of vehicles N = {1, 2, ..., n}.
• The VCS is a trusted entity that acts as a task server,
which is responsible for announcing a task and recruiting
vehicles to achieve this task. It is also responsible for
distributing rewards to participating vehicles in return for
their resources.
• The RSU acts as a gateway that is responsible for
transmitting the messages that come from the VCS to
vehicles and those that come from vehicles to the VCS.
• The vehicles act as service providers by completing allo-
cated tasks using their sensor devices. Sensing resources
may differ between vehicles because of their different
sensor devices.
• The Trusted Authority (TA) is responsible for registering
the vehicles and creating accounts to record their reward.
Communication Model. When the VCS seeks available
vehicular sensing resources, it will send an announced task
that includes some specific requirements towards one of its
connected RSUs, as shown in Fig. 1. Once the RSU receives
the task from the VCS, it will broadcast it to all vehicles within
its communication range. The interested vehicles respond with
their parameters to the VCS via the RSU. In turn, the VCS
starts bargaining with vehicles and selects those with optimum
parameters. The selected vehicles finish the tasks with their
sensing resources and receive reward from the VCS.

B. Attack Model
In the system model, the RSU is responsible for establishing
communication between the VCS and vehicles, and is con-
sidered to be semi-trusted. We consider the case that data
generated by vehicles and forwarded to the VCS via RSUs
could face a passive attack and reveal private information.
Also, a malicious RSU may modify or forge some sensitive
information in order to make the VCS accept false results for
its own purposes.
C. Design Goals
Our goal is to design an efficient privacy-preserving incen-
tive mechanism that will prevent the above security threats
with stimulating the involvement of competent vehicles. The
specific objective of this mechanism are as follows.
• Authentication and Integrity: This involves the ability
to authenticate the message source and its integrity.
• Confidentiality: This aspect ensures sensitive informa-
tion of the message cannot be revealed.
• Incentive Mechanism: This involves the design of an in-
centive mechanism that recruits vehicles without forfeit-
ing fairness in regard to strategies and earned incentives.
III. PRELIMINARIES
A. Bilinear Group
Let G1 and G2 be two cyclic groups with the same prime
order q. A mapping ê : G1 × G1 → G2 is an admissible
bilinear pairing if (ê) over elliptic curves [6] with the following
properties:
• Bilinearity: ∀P,Q, V ∈ G1 and a, b ∈ Z∗q , we have
– ê(P,Q+ V ) = ê(P,Q)ê(P, V ).
436

– ê(aP, bQ) = ê(P,Q)ab = ê(bP, aQ).
• Non-Degeneracy: ∀P,Q ∈ G1, where
– P �= 0⇒ ê(P,Q) �= 1 ∈ G2.
• Computability: ê is efficiently computable.
B. Complexity Assumptions
We assume the discrete logarithm problem related to our
security proposal as follows.
Definition 1: Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) Prob-
lem. Given P, aP, bP ∈ G1, ∀a, b ∈ Z∗q , compute abP ∈ G1
probability within polynomial time.
Definition 2: Decisional Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH)
Problem. Given P, aP, bP, cP ∈ G1, ∀a, b, c ∈ Z∗q and f ∈
G2, decide whether f = ê(P, P )abc.
IV. PROPOSED PRIVACY-PRESERVING INCENTIVE
MECHANISM
In this section, we present a detailed privacy-preserving
incentive mechanism in details, consists of the following parts:
A. System Initialization
The TA initializes the system by generating the bilinear
parameters (G1, G2, P , ê, q) via the security parameter λ.
It then selects s ∈ Z∗q as a master private key and computes
the corresponding public key Ppub = sP . P is a generator
of G1. Additional, the TA determines three collision resistant
hash functions: H1 : {0, 1}∗ → Z∗q , H2 : G1 → {0, 1}n,
H3 : {0, 1}n → G1. The system public parameters are
published as param = (G1,G2, q, P, ê, Ppub, H1, H2, H3).
B. Key Generation
Vehicle i should sends its identity IDi to the TA to join
the system. For protecting each registered vehicle i’ IDi,
the TA generates a pseudo identity. The pseudo identity is
usually generated from the real identity and a random salt
such that Qi = H3(IDi, salt). It is worth noting that the
introduction of a random salt is used to prevent the rainbow
table attack, which defeat such kind of pseudonym based
mechanism for anonymity. In the rainbow table attack, the
adversary can create a huge table that contains the mapping
of all the real identities and their corresponding pseudonyms.
The table is called rainbow table. Whenever a pseudonym is
used in a message, the adversary can find out its real identity
by searching the table for the pseudonym. Then, TA selects
xi → Z∗q randomly and computes pki = xiP as vehicle i’s
private and public keys. (pki, xi, Qi) are sent to vehicle i.

IDn Saltn Qn
C. Task Announcement
The VCS announces a task Ti attached with its specifica-
tions towards one of its connected RSUs. We can exploit the
location privacy-aware task recommendation or the privacy-
preserving task announcement schemes used in [7], [14] to
prevent Ti from any possible attacks [7], [14]. The VCS
protects the content of ti from any adversaries as follows.
αvc ← Signcryp(pkvc, xvc, ti).
The RSU then broadcasts αvc towards all potential participat-
ing vehicles within its communication range. If any vehicle
i is interested in joining Ti, it will first check whether the
message is from the VCS by decrypting αvc as follows.
α′vc ← UnSigncrypt(xi, αvc).
The interested vehicle i will then authenticate itself to the VCS
by signcrypting its parameter setup as follows.
• The vehicle i randomly selects ri ∈ Z∗q , and
• Computes Li = riP .
• Computes Ui = ripkvc.
• Computes Ki = H2(Li ‖ Ui).
• Computes ci = Ki ⊕ mi.
• Computes hi = H3(ci).
• Computes σi = (xi + ri)hi.
• The ciphertext is: αi = (Li, σi, ci).
The vehicle i then sends the αi to the VCS via the RSU.
D. Aggregate-Verification
If the RSU receives each ciphertext separately, it has to
verify the signature; this will take a long time and may lead
to long delays. Consequently, our proposed scheme adopts the
aggregation technique that enables the RSU to aggregate all
cipheretexts (αi)
n
i=1 into one ciphertext (αagg) and simulta-
neously verify them. Hence the RSU:
• Takes a collection of individual ciphertexts αi = (Li, σi,
ci)
n
i=1 with their corresponding public keys (pki)
n
i=1.
• Computes the signature aggregation σagg =
∑n
i=1 σi.
• Outputs the aggregate ciphertexts αagg =
(L1...Ln, c1...cn, σagg).
• Accepts (σagg) if the following equation is valid.
ê(σagg, P ) = ê(
n∑
i=1
hi, pki)ê(
n∑
i=1
hi, Li).
If the batch verification is true, the RSU forwards αagg to the
VCS in order to complete the unsigncryption step.
E. Data Receiving
The VCS will complete the unsigncrypt as follows.
• Computes U ′i = xvcLi.
• Computes K ′
i = H2(Li ‖ U ′i).
• Computes mi = ci ⊕K ′
i.
After decrypting all ciphertexts, the VCS will evaluate and
choose as the winners vehicles with optimal parameter setup.
• The correctness of our signature scheme is as follows.

F. Vehicular Resource Evaluation Mechanism
In this paper, we put forward a vehicular resource evaluation
by which the vehicle represents different types of sensing
resources. Typically, vehicular ability may differ between
different vehicles because of their different sensor devices,
which means that a vehicle can provide a variety of sensing
resources based on the number of sensor devices it possesses
[5]. Thus, the challenge here is how to reveal the diversity
of vehicle’s valuation in terms of the number of sensing
resources that each vehicle can provide. For each announced
task, the VCS may need to collect vehicle’s sensing data,
hence we use Ti = {ts, te, L,Γt} to denote the announced
task, where Γt = {τ1, τ2, ..., τk} denotes k number of sensing
tasks required by the VCS. L = (xi, yi) denotes the required
location through a Global Positioning System (GPS) [8].
ts and te denote the beginning and end of the required
time period. Based on variant sensor devices, each vehicle
can provide various types of sensing resources. Thus, each
vehicle i selects one or a subset of requested tasks Γi ⊆ Γt
based on its capability. A parameter li denotes the number of
sensing resources that can be provided by the vehicle i. We
use λi = {li,Γi, locationi} to denote the vehicle parameter.
Note that it is possible that Γi ∩ Γj for two vehicles i and j.
This interference make the problem NP-complete [9]. Indeed,
to express the vehicle’s valuation in terms of performance,
the VCS performs a penalty (peni) for delay time such that
a vehicle’s valuation for its utility will be loss per unit delay
time as shown in Fig. 2. The time delay can be calculated as
di = (ti − te). The penalty can be calculated as:
PNi =
⎧⎪⎨
⎪⎩
di · peni, if ti > te,
0, elsewhere

G. Incentive Model
We assume vehicles are selfish, hence each of them intends
to provide a number of different sensing resources li in
one task to maximize its profit. Therefore, we regard these
vehicles as non-cooperative game. Additionally, we assume
that the VCS has a limited budget Bi for every task to be
accomplished. As a result, the VCS needs to distribute the
tasks on selected vehicles based on Bi. Consequently, in this
paper, we intend to address two fundamental problems, the first
of which is how to identify the vehicles that should be selected
as winners. The second problem concerns how many sensing
resources each winner vehicle should be provided within one
task. Given a pool of vehicles N , the VCS aims to pick a set
of vehicles with optimal parameters that can cover the budget
Bi. Consequently, we utilize the Bargain Game to model the
relationship between the VCS and the vehicles. The process
for selecting the wining vehicles is as follows.
• Step 1: The VCS announces Ti and gives a price pi,
where pi represents the price per unit sensing resource.
• Step 2: Each vehicle i observes pi and then chooses the
number of sensing resources li. If pi is unsatisfied with
vehicle i, it would not offer resources such that li = 0.
• Step 3: Vehicle i and the VCS start to bargain over the
number of sensing resources li that vehicle i can provide.
• Step 4: The VCS sorts all vehicles according to their
resources such that:
V1 > ... > Vi > ... > Vn.
Vehicle i with large sensing resources li is more valuable
and attractive to the VCS.
• Step 5: The VCS selects subset S as winners from step
4 until we have (R ≥ Bi), where R = Σn
i=1li.
Algorithm 1 describes our winner vehicle selection process.

H. Profits Model
Without loss of generality, the VCS has exclusive control
over the price pi making, while each vehicle has exclusive
control over offering the number of sensing resources li.
Hence, it is necessary to make an appropriate resource price
pi to attract various types of vehicles to contribute their data
resources to the VC. The VCS’s profit function from the
sensing resources is formulated as,
Ui(pi, li) = Ri(li)− pili (1)
where Ri(li) represents the VCS’s revenue, (pili) is the vehicle
i’s reward, such that the VCS rewards every vehicle i based
on its li. Thus, the vehicle’s profit function is formulated as,
Ti(pi, li) = pili − Si(li) (2)
where Si(li) denotes the total cost of sensing resources li.
Each vehicle i has a different total cost Si(li) based on the li
it provides. The Ri(li) and Si(li) are simulated by constant
elasticity of substitution (CES) functio [10], as shown below.
Ri(li) =
lγi
γ
− PNi (3)
Si(li) =
lδi
δ
− PNi (4)
where γ and δ are elastic parameters of these two functions.
We have 0 ≤ γ ≤ 1 and δ ≥ 1 as convex and concave
function. The ultimate goal for each vehicle i is to maximize
its profits by finding the optimal l∗i in response to the pi given
by the VCS. Thus, the optimization problem for vehicle i is
formulated as,
maxli≥0 Ti(pi, li) = [pili − ( l
δ
i
δ
− PNi)] (5)
Each vehicle i can improve its utility by deviating from its
current strategy to a Nash Equilibrium (NE) [11]. Based on the
NE concept, each vehicle i performs its best response strategy,
which maximizes its own utility function to achieve maximum
profit. In order to achieve the best response strategy l∗i (pi) for
the vehicle i based on (pi) given by the VCS, we need to solve
equation (5) by taking its first-order derivative, which results
in:
pi − lδ−1
i = 0 (6)
limli→0 lδ−1
i =∞ and limli→∞ lδ−1
i = 0, representing that
the first-order derivative on (5) has a solution. Thus, the best
response strategy for a vehicle is formulated as,
l∗i = (p
1
δ−1
i ) (7)
The ultimate goal of the VCS is to obtain the largest number
of sensing resources with the lowest prices pi. We assume
that the VCS knows vehicle reaction to pi will be to choose
the demand function of the amount of sensing resources l∗i =
(p
1
δ−1
i ), so that the VCS can choose its optimal p∗i to maximize
its revenue by expecting a vehicle’s best response. Thus, the
optimization problem for the VCS is formulated as,
maxpi≥0 Ui(pi, l
∗
i ) = [(
(p
1
δ−1
i )γ
γ
− PNi)− pi(p
1
δ−1
i )] (8)
We then take the first-order derivative of equation (8), which
results in:
δ =
(p
γ−1
δ−1
i )
pi
(9)
The best response strategy for the VCS is by solving the
equation (9) to obtain p∗i . Thus, (p∗i , l
∗
i (p
∗
i )) is a NE outcome
of our Bargain Game mode.

V. SECURITY ANALYSIS
In this section, we briefly summarize the security properties
of our proposed privacy-preserving incentive mechanism.
• Security and Privacy Preservation. The proposed scheme
guarantees the confidentiality and integrity of a mes-
sage under to CDH problem. Thus, an adversary cannot
decrypt and modify any message without knowing the
receiver’s private key and ri, which is randomly chosen
from the sender and used to calculate Li and Ui.
• Mutual Authentication. In the proposed scheme, only a
registered vehicle i can sign a message by calculating
σi using its private key. The VCS verifies σi under
the DBDH and establishes mutual authentication by
computing U ′i using its private key. Thus, mutual authen-
tication between the VCS and vehicles can be achieved.
• Anonymity. In our scheme, each vehicle i uses its pseudo
identity Qi that is generated from its real identity during
the registration processes. Thus, no one can reveal the
real identity of vehicle i during the transmission process.

VI. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
A. Performance of Privacy-preserving
In this section, we demonstrate the performance of the pro-
posed privacy-preserving protocol in terms of computational
cost and communication overhead. We count the number of
complicated cryptographic operations, including scalar mul-
tiplication in G1, G2 exponentiation and computation cost
pairing ê. We denote P1, P2 and P3 , the point multiplication
in G1, exponentiation in G2 and pairing ê. The computation is
conducted by using a notebook with Intel Core i5-4200U CPU
@2.29GHz and 4.00GB memory. We use MIRACL library
5.6.1 curve with Tate pairing to implement number-theoretic
based methods of cryptography [12]. To ensure the security of
the proposed scheme, the parameter q is approximately 160
bits. The running time is displayed in Table II.
We also analyze the communication overhead of our scheme
from two aspects: vehicle-to-RSU communication and RSU-
to-VCS communication. When a vehicle i sends its resource,
it needs to send the encrypted report αi to the RSU, which is
320 + 256 bits, if we assume the binary length of G1 is 160
bits and z∗q is 256 bits. The RSU aggregates (αi)
n
i = 1 and
sends σagg, which is [n(160 + 256) + 160] bits. The binary
length of the encrypted message between the RSU and VCS
increases linearly with the growth of n.

B. Effectiveness Analysis of Incentive Mechanism
In this section, we conduct a numerical analysis of the
proposed incentive mechanism. The expression of (p∗i , l
∗
i (p
∗
i ))
is the NE outcome of our Bargain Game mode. We examine
the utility of both the VCS and the vehicles. The VCS’s utility
is calculated by subtracting (R(l∗)) from the reward (p∗l∗)
while the vehicle utility is calculated by subtracting (p∗l∗)
from its cost (S(l∗)). R(l∗) and S(l∗) are simulated by using
two parameters γ and δ. Thus, in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, we examine
the VCS and vehicle utility in terms of increasing (δ) ascently.
We set three fixed values (γ) to be 0.9, 0.5 and 0.2. As shown
in Fig. 4, by increasing (δ), the VCS’s utility also increases
while the vehicle’s utility decreases as seen in Fig. 5. Thus,
we deduce that increasing (δ) has a positive influence on the
VCS’s utility and a negative influence on the vehicle’s utility.
We also examine the VCS and vehicle utilities in terms of
increasing (γ) ascently. We fix (δ) in three values: 10, 5 and
2. As in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, by increasing (γ), the utility of
both the VCS and vehicles is decreased. Thus, (γ) value can
negatively influence the VCS and vehicle utilities. In addition,
Fig. 7 shows that the vehicle utility can also influenced by the
order of the three fixed values of (δ) (10, 5 and 2).

Accordingly, we infer that the (γ) and (δ) make our incen-
tive model more reasonable and fair in order to satisfy the VCS
and vehicles during the bargaining process. This guarantees
that every rational vehicle will bargain with a large number

of resources li to maximize its revenue. In contrast, the VCS
should offer optimal (p∗) to motivate vehicles into joining the
task. Fig. 3 shows the relationship between (p∗) and (l∗).
In Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, we show the impact of the penalty on
the utilities of the VCS and the vehicles. We set three penalty
values (Penalty = 0, Penalty = 2 and Penalty = 4). Increasing
the number of resources results in an increase in the utilities of
both the VCS and the vehicles. As a result, our Bargain Game
model can result in a win-win outcome. However, for lazy
vehicles, we can see that as shown in Fig. 9 and Fig. 8 with
Penalty = 2 and Penalty = 4, the vehicle’s utility decreases.
This guarantees that every rational vehicle will take the time
requirements into consideration.
By summarizing the above results, our proposed incen-
tive mechanism works effectively and can guarantee fairness
amongst vehicles. Since it compensates each vehicle based on
the number of its resources and penalizes any vehicle that
delays submitting its result in the desired time period.
VII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving incen-
tive mechanism in the VC. The proposed incentive mechanism
can select optimal vehicles. We also describe a vehicular re-
source evaluation mechanism that enables the VCS to calculate
vehicles’ rewards based on their resources and penalize lazy
vehicles. Through performance analysis, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed incentive mechanism in terms of
the utilities of the VCS and vehicles. In addition, the proposed
privacy-preserving protocol meets security requirements with
more efficiency regarding computational cost and communi-
cation overhead. In future work, the truthful social cost and
privacy issues related to guaranteeing the availability of the
incentive mechanism will be considered.
