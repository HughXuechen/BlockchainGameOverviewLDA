ABSTRACT
Sealed bid auctions are used to allocate a resource among a set
of interested parties. Traditionally, auctions need the presence of
a trusted auctioneer to whom the bidders provide their private
bid values. Existence of such a trusted party is not an assumption
easily realized in practice. Generic secure computation protocols
can be used to remove a trusted party. However, generic techniques
result in inefficient protocols, and typically do not provide fairness
– that is, a corrupt party can learn the output and abort the protocol
thereby preventing other parties from learning the output.
At CRYPTO 2009, Miltersen, Nielsen and Triandopoulos [29],
introduced the problem of building auctions that are secure against
rational bidders. Such parties are modeled as self-interested agents
who care more about maximizing their utility than about learning
information about bids of other agents. To realize this, they put
forth a novel notion of information utility and introduce a game-
theoretic framework that helps analyse protocols while taking into
account both information utility as well asmonetary utility. Unfortu-
nately, their construction makes use a of generic MPC protocol and,
consequently, the authors do not analyze the concrete efficiency of
their protocol.
In this work, we construct the first concretely efficient and prov-
ably secure protocol for First Price Auctions in the rational setting.
Our protocol guarantees privacy, public verifiability and fairness.
Inspired by [29], we put forth a solution concept that we call Privacy
Enhanced Computational Weakly Dominant Strategy Equilibrium
that captures parties’ privacy and monetary concerns in the game
theoretic context, and show that our protocol realizes this. We
believe this notion to be of independent interest.
Our protocol is crafted specifically for the use case of auctions,
is simple, using off-the-shelf cryptographic components. Executing
our auction protocol on commodity hardware with 30 bidders, with
bids of length 10, our protocol runs to completion in 0.429𝑠 and has
total communication of 82KB.

1 INTRODUCTION
From Psychology, to Economics, to Computer Science, the wide
perspectives from which auctions have been studied is a testimony
to their relevance in society. Auctions have been in vogue since
time immemorial and [24] refers to auctions as early as 500 BC. In
fact, the Roman Empire was auctioned in the year 193AD! While
the modern age offers far less dramatic use-cases of auctions, the
ubiquity and the monetary stakes of the use-cases make up for it.
Governments accrue huge revenues through spectrum auctions.
Sotheby’s auctions for the art works have been legendary in terms
of works that have gone under their hammer. Search engines such
as Google use auctions to determine which advertisements show
up for a certain search and in what order. Broadcasting rights for
sporting events are distributed through auctions. Sports franchisees
use auctions for player-selection. It would not be too far from the
truth to say that what can be auctioned is limited only by one’s
imagination.
An auction consists of a set of parties (also known as bidders)
who are bidding for a particular object or resource. Such parties
submit their bids i.e., the amount at which the parties are willing
to buy the auctioned item. There are mainly two types of auctions:
sealed bid and open bid auctions. As the name itself suggests, in
the case of open bid auctions, the individual bids are not private. In
sealed bid auctions, we can have either First Price Auctions or Second
Price Auctions (Vickrey Auctions). In both these types, the winner
of auction is the bidder who bids the highest. However, the price
paid by the winner differs in these two auctions. In the case of first
price auctions, the winner pays the same price that it bid (and won).
For second price auctions, winner pays the price which equals the
bid value of second highest bidder. First price auctions (FPA) are
widely believed to be fairer to everyone involved and companies like
Google are shifting to FPA for auctioning advertisement spaces [31].
In this work, we focus on first price sealed bid auctions.
Traditional auctions take place in presence of a trusted auction-
eer – to whom the bidders provide their private bid values. However,
the notion of a trusted party is difficult to realize in practice. In this
digital age, with e-auctions being the norm, there is a need to re-
place such a trusted party with a secure protocol that does not leak
any private bid values. Auctions also tend to be a high-stakes game
for the participants, offering plenty of incentives for corruption.
Therefore an auction protocol needs to prevent corrupt behavior
by being publicly verifiable as well as by having fairness (i.e., if one
party learns the output, so do the other parties). Maliciously Secure

Multi-Party Computation (MPC) offers a solution to this problem:
the set of bidders, who may be mutually non-trusting and possibly
corrupt, may simply run an MPC protocol to compute the maxi-
mum bid value. However, securing against malicious parties, that
too using generic MPC, comes at a heavy cost: such solutions incur
huge computational and communication overheads, making them
inefficient for use in practice. Fortunately, for typical use-cases of
auctions, safeguarding against malicious parties, who can deviate
arbitrarily, is an overkill. Indeed, malicious strategies include those
that parties may never adopt in real-life.
At Crypto 2009, Miltersen, Nielsen and Triandopoulos [29], in-
troduced the problem of building auctions that are secure against
rational bidders. Such parties are modeled as a self-interested agents
who care more about the monetary payoffs rather than learning in-
formation about bids of other agents. An important contribution of
their work is that they put forth a novel notion of information utility
and introduce game-theoretic framework that helps us capture the
interplay between monetary and information utilitites. Formalizing
this is not trivial because the utility of the same information may
be different for different parties. Yet, this abstract concept, which
cannot be concretized, must play a role for privacy-enhanced auc-
tions in the rational setting and this makes it very challenging. Our
work is inspired by this beautiful work.
In this work, we build auctions that are secure against rational
parties who simply wish to maximize their utility. Our protocol is
relevant in scenarios when parties can be disincentivized against
certain kinds of “bad behavior" through monetary penalties. This
is true, for example, in cases where parties register for the auction
by paying a security deposit, which they will forego if cheating is
detected. Prior work such as [8, 29] have considered auctions for ra-
tional adversaries. We offer a detailed comparison of the efficiency
improvements of our protocol in Section 1. Additionally, [8] has
no formal proof of security for rational adversaries. In fact, as the
authors themselves point out, their work as well as that of [5] has
some non-trivial leakage – the highest bidder learns information
where he overtook the bid of the second highest bidder. We offer a
rigorous, game-theoretic treatment of secure auctions and demon-
strate that our protocol achieves “Privacy Enhanced Computational
Dominant Strategy Equilibrium", a notion that we introduce. Intu-
itively, this means, following the protocol is the preferred option
for each party, irrespective of what other parties might choose to
do.
Our Contribution. We present the first concretely efficient pro-
tocol for First Price Auction with guaranteed privacy that achieves
Computational Weakly Dominant Strategy Equilibrium for rational
parties without the need for any trusted setup. Our protocol ensures
fairness and is publicly verifiable. We have implemented our pro-
tocol in C++ with 1840 lines of code. We build upon OpenSSL and
Boost open source libraries. Running our protocol on a commodity
hardware (with Intel core i7 processor, 2.9 GH), with 30 bidders, 10
bit length bids resulted in 0.082MB communication and took 0.429s.
We have shown that our protocol is concretely more efficient than
other secure auction implementations, including ones using generic
MPC protocols.

1.1 Technical Overview
The starting point of our work is the work of [5] which in turn
uses the Anonymous Veto Protocol(AVP) due to [19]. Originally, AVP
was designed for computing the logical-OR of a set of 1-bit private
inputs from different parties. This was enhanced to compute the
maximum bid value (for auctions) in the work of [5]. We call this
protocol Anonymous Bid Protocol (ABP) and it runs for 𝑙 rounds,
where 𝑙 is the number of bits in the binary representation of bid
values. Technically, in ABP, bits are written onto the bulletin board
in the clear. However, when used in auctions, it is combined with a
specific encoding scheme for the sake of privacy. Here, we give an
overview of ABP with the encodings incorporated into it. The high
level idea of the 𝑙-round ABP protocol [5] is as follows:
(1) All messages are written onto a bulletin board.
(2) Parties learn the highest bid value bit-by-bit. Let 𝑏𝑖 𝑗 denote
𝑃𝑖 ’s bit used in 𝑗th round. We say that a party 𝑃𝑖 drops out
of the race at the end of round 𝑗 , if 𝑏𝑖 𝑗 = 0 but ∃𝑖′ such that
𝑃𝑖′ is still in the race and 𝑏𝑖′ 𝑗 = 1. Once a party 𝑃𝑖 drops
out of the race, it continues to participate in the protocol
using only the dummy bid value of 𝑏𝑖 𝑗 = 0 for all subsequent
rounds.
(3) INPUT SPECIFICATION. Parties specify their inputs in any
round by encoding it using an encoding scheme with a spe-
cific structure. Encoding of a 1 bit is 𝑔𝑟 for a random 𝑟 and
where 𝑔 is the generator of an appropriately chosen group G.
𝑃𝑖 ’s encoding of 0 is a value with the following property: if
all parties have a zero bit, then multiplying their encodings
will result in 1.
(4) HIGHEST BID EVALUATION. To evaluate, the parties simply
multiply all the encoded bid values. (This can be done pub-
licly by any of the parties which has access to the encoded
bids.) If, in round 𝑗 , the product is 1, then we conclude that all
parties contributed only 0 in that round and in particular, the
highest bidder 𝑃𝑖∗ had a 0 in the index 𝑗 i.e., 𝑏𝑖∗ 𝑗 = 0. If the
product is not 1, then the parties conclude that the highest
bit value in that round/index is 1. Note that this conclusion
would indeed be correct, because of a) the property which
encodings of 0 satisfy and b) the fact that as long as at least
one party contributes 𝑔𝑟 for a random 𝑟 , the product of the
encodings is unlikely to be 1.

Secure Auctions in the Presence of Rational Adversaries CCS ’22, November 7–11, 2022, Los Angeles, CA, USA
At a high level, privacy follows from the Decisional Diffie Hellman
(DDH) assumption. To use ABP to build secure auctions, [5, 8] do
the following:
• All parties commit to their bid values.
• They run ABP using a bulletin board to communicate and at
the end of which they learn the highest bid value.
• The highest bidder opens out his commitment to prove that
he did have the highest bid.
• To secure against malicious adversaries, parties simply use
NIZKs at every step in order to offer a proof of correct com-
putation.
There are two issues with this protocol: first, as mentioned before,
the use of NIZKs makes it inefficient and second, the highest bidder,
through some offline computations, can learn information on the
bid of the second highest bidder. The idea to learn this leakage is
as follows: when a party contributes the encoding of a 1 bit in any
round 𝑗 , he can easily check if there is any other party who has a 1
in that round. To do so, instead of the encoding of 1 that he used,
he computes an encoding of 0 and multiplies it with the rest of the
encodings that have been written onto the bulletin board. (Note
that he can do this offline.) If the product is equal to 1, he knows
that all other parties have contributed encodings of 0. If not, he
knows that the rest of the parties contributed with encodings of 1.
The highest bidder, specifically, can use this technique to determine
the round at the end of which the second highest bidder dropped
out of the race and learn first few bits of second highest bid.
Preventing Leakage in [5, 8] Observe that it is the presence
of the encodings on the bulletin board that allows all parties to
learn the output (the winning bid value and identity of winner) in
a publicly verifiable and fair manner. However, in order to prevent
leakage, we need to prevent the parties from running offline com-
putations with these encodings. This would in turn require us to
ensure that the bulletin board does not directly contain encodings.
At the same time, for the sake of efficiency, we need to avoid using
generic MPC protocols. Our first idea is to designate a specific party
as an Evaluator who, in addition to being a bidder, also handles
the computation of the winning bid. To accomplish this, parties
send their encodings to the evaluator. This can be accomplished
by having the parties encrypt their encodings with the evaluator’s
public key and writing these on to the bulletin board. This will
enable her to learn the per-round outputs (i.e., the highest bid value
for that round) and reveal it to the other parties. One obvious issue
which arises is that this violates fairness but we can enforce by
imposing monetary penalties if that happens, thereby making that
strategy irrational for the evaluator .
A bigger challenge is that if the evaluator has all the encodings,
then in a case when the evaluator herself has the highest bid, she can
learn the exact same leakage as before. The following observation
is critical to our protocol: the evaluator does not need to learn
the encodings when she is contributing a 1 bit herself as she can
directly set the output of that round to be 1. We therefore need
to ensure that she does not learn the encodings in such cases. At
the same time, the protocol cannot leak to other parties that the
evaluator has a 1 bit. Oblivious transfer (OT) to the rescue! Parties
run a maliciously secure OT protocol with the evaluator wherein,
if the evaluator ’s contributing bit in a round is 0, she learns the
bit encodings as before and if it is 1, she learns cipher texts of
dummy messages. This introduces a further problem: the evaluator
could cheat and ask for real encodings even though she has a 1
and is still in the race. While this can easily be solved using NIZKs,
the main challenge is in figuring out how the evaluator can prove
correctness of computation without relying on NIZKs. One way
would be to insist that she “open out" all the randomness used in
her OT computations (as well as the commitment to her input) so
that the other parties can verify correctness. Revealing her own
input is a violation of her privacy unless she has the highest bid.
While this might seem like a deadlock situation, we argue that it is
not. The key idea of this protocol is that the evaluator only learns
information if she is the highest bidder. If she is not the highest
bidder, she learns nothing other than the winning bid by cheating
and it is fine for the other parties to not detect this cheating. In
other words, she does not need to give a proof when she is not the
highest bidder. (We stress that in the entire protocol, we will have
several cheating strategies which may go undetected; this won’t be
a problem – we will argue that in all such strategies too, the parties
will learn nothing extra and have no incentive to cheat.) To sum up,
when the evaluator is the highest bidder, we will have the evaluator
offer a proof of correct computation by revealing the randomness
used to compute the OT messages as well as her input. This does
not leak any information because the evaluator’s bid is the highest
and is therefore not a secret!
As it turns out, even with this modification, the highest bidder
could potentially learn information by deviating from the protocol.
Consider a case when a party with the highest bid uses a 0 bit
instead of a 1 bit in some round 𝑗 . For the rest of the rounds, he
follows the protocol as though he did not deviate. Now consider
a scenario where he actually wins – this means that there was
another party who had a 1 in round 𝑗 . This is auxiliary information
that he is not authorized to learn. Intuitively, what we need is a
way for parties to give a proof of correct computation, in the event
that they win. However, this is complicated by the fact that the
evaluator does not even use the true input of the party in cases
where she herself contributes a 1. Added to this, we also need to
deter the evaluator from cheating. All of this results in a few more
extensions to the protocol which we describe informally in the
overview below.
Finally, it may also be possible that when the evaluator an-
nounces the winning bid, no one comes forward to claim the bid. In
such a case, parties need to give a proof of not winning. Note that
here too we avoid the use of NIZKs by carefully analyzing the ABP
protocol and providing an alternate proof that will help detect the
deviating party. Specifically, we observe that there exists a certain
round, which we call as last decider round in which the winning
party alone uses a 1-bit code and all other parties use 0-bit codes.
This means, an honest losing bidder can prove that it indeed used a
0-bit code during the last decider round. This important observation
leads us to design proofs of not winning when the winner fails to
turn up.
To obtain the final protocol, we carefully consider these and
many other subtle adversarial strategies. We refer the reader to
Section 3. For now, we present a high level overview of the protocol.

Protocol Overview
(1) Set-up PhaseWe assume that all 𝑃𝑖 who wish to participate
in the auction, register by paying a deposit 𝐷 .
(2) Each party 𝑃𝑖 has as input its private valuation of auctioned
item 𝑣𝑖 , bid value 𝑏𝑖 .
(3) 𝑃𝑖 receives the public parameters pp.
(4) Party 𝑃𝑖 commits to its bid value as well as to the hash of
the randomness he will use in the rest of the protocol. (This
will be used to verify correctness of 𝑃 ′
𝑖
s computations, in the
event that he claims to have the winning bid.)
(5) One of the parties is chosen to be the evaluator and we
denote it by 𝑃𝑒 .
(6) Computation Phase The protocol proceeds in rounds and
in each round parties run the ABP protocol as explained
earlier. This roughly translates to running an OT protocol
with the evaluator to reveal the encoding of bit it chooses
to contribute in that round (or the encoding of a dummy bit,
depending on the evaluator ’s input). We use the terminology
“contributing to a round" to stress the point that the party
may not input its true bid value for that index, if it is no
longer in the race. At the end of this phase, the evaluator
announces the winning bid.
(7) If no one comes to claim the winning bid, all parties offer a
proof of not winning.
(8) A party, 𝑃𝑤 , claiming to have the winning bid, needs to give
a proof of winning. First, he opens the commitment to his
bid value which matches the winning bid. Additionally, he
engages in a protocol with the evaluator to convince the
evaluator that he did play honestly. Roughly this consists of
the following steps:
(a) 𝑃𝑤 opens his commitments to reveal his bid as well as the
hash of the randomness. He also shares the randomness
to enable verification of the hash value.
(b) The evaluator uses her own randomness which she uses
to generate the OT first message to check the consistency
of the encodings. Informally, the evaluator verifies the
following statement for each round: “When I contributed
a 0 bit, the prover did send me his true encoding which is
consistent with the bit in that index. When I contributed
a 1 bit, the prover’s second message is computed correctly
as a function of the encoding of his true input, encoding
of his dummy input, the randomness he committed to, as
well as my OT first message." This is easy to accomplish
given that the 𝑃𝑒 has the randomness that 𝑃𝑤 has used to
generate the OT second message as well as the encodings.
(9) Whenever a party’s deviation is detected, the protocol ter-
minates and the party forgoes their deposit.
Security In order to argue security, we note that a rational party
may see value in a) increasing his monetary utility by winning the
protocol and b) learning information about other players’ inputs. To
capture the latter, we use the term information utility, as introduced
in [29]. We introduce the notion of Privacy Enhanced Computational
Weakly Dominant Strategy Equilibrium for analyzing the privacy
concerns of rational parties. This equilibrium states that as long as
parties value monetary utility much more than information utility,
there is no incentive for them to deviate from the protocol. Next,
for parties that do not deviate from the protocol, we argue privacy
using the simulation paradigm.
While there have been works on cryptographic protocols achiev-
ing Computational Nash Equilibrium (e.g. in [29], [30],[10]), to the
best of our knowledge, ours is the first work that is able to establish
Privacy Enhanced Computational weakly Dominant Strategy Equi-
librium for first price auction protocols. This equilibrium notion
can be of independent interest.
1.2 Related Work
Rational Secure Computation. The work of Dodis, Halevi and
Rabin [10] initiated a line of work on capturing game-theoretic
notions of incentives in cryptographic definitions. The work of
Halpern and Teague [18] considered secret sharing and secure com-
putation in the rational setting where parties are rational with a
utility function that is curious-then-exclusive: parties primarily
prefer to learn the output, and secondarily, if they learn the output,
have as few other parties learn it as possible. They define a solution
concept that is a notion of Nash equilibrium. Further works define
more variants of equilibrium like computational versions, modeling
collusion etc. [1, 14, 16, 17, 23]. Note that while a Nash equilibrium
ensures that following the protocol is the optimal strategy when all
other protocols do follow the strategy, it does not say anything in
scenarios where parties are likely to deviate. A dominant strategy
equilibrium, on the other hand, does not care for other people’s
strategies: following the protocol is indeed the most preferred strat-
egy for a party regardless of what other people’s strategy might
be. Biçer, Yildiz and Küpçü make use of Weakly dominant strategy
for coalitions in their work [6] to develop the notion of m-stability
which offers threshold security against a coalition of size𝑚. An-
other rich line of work in rational cryptography is in the Rational
Protocol Design (RPD) framework introduced by Garay, Katz, Mau-
rer, Tackmann and Zikas [12] and employed subsequently in [4, 13].
In RPD, a two-party game is considered between a protocol designer
and an external attacker where the attacker’s goal is to break secu-
rity properties, and the goal of the protocol designer is to prevent
the attacker from succeeding. RPD makes analysis of collusions,
adaptive corruptions etc. easier, and also provides compositional
guarantees. In [28], Micali and Rabin discuss prevention of collu-
sion among bidders, participating in Vickrey auctions. In our work,
modeling incentive-driven behaviour of mutually distrustful parties
suffice, and we leave extending our protocol to the RPD framework
and Vickrey auctions to future work.
Covert Secure Computation. A different line of work on covert
adversaries incorporates some types of incentives into crypto-
graphic definitions. Aumann and Lindell [3] proposed the notion
of covert adversaries that are in between standard semi-honest and
malicious adversaries: these are parties who will cheat but only
as long as they do not get caught cheating. This “fear" of getting
caught is used to build more efficient protocols [2, 25]. This model
is also captured by the rational model by defining the utility to be
negative when an abort happens in an identifiable way.

Secure Auctions in the Presence of Rational Adversaries CCS ’22, November 7–11, 2022, Los Angeles, CA, USA
Rational Secure Auctions. In the context of auctions, our work
is closely related to three works. The work of Miltersen, Nielsen
and Triandopoulos [29] defines a rational security framework for
auctions and introduce the notion of Privacy enhanced 𝜖-Nash Equi-
librium. We use the notions of monetary and information utility as
in [29], but put forth a different solution concept. Additionally, the
protocol of [29] uses generic MPC techniques secure against active
corruptions. In our work, however, we take advantage of parties be-
ing rational, and not arbitrarily malicious, to construct an efficient
protocol. Our protocol is relevant in scenarios where (a) monetary
penalties can be imposed on parties whose cheating is detected and
(b) parties have access to a bulletin board. Both these assumptions
are easily implementable in practice. Many auctions require parties
to register with a fee anyway. The latter can be implemented with a
simple webpage. Needless to say, for blockchain applications of auc-
tions, the blockchain itself is a bulletin board, and one can simply
use a smart contract for managing the deposits. On-chain auctions
have applications in bootstrapping a virtual ASIC blockchain sys-
tem [11], and in auction-based minting mechanisms [9].
The work of Bag, Hao, Shahandashti, and Ghosh[5] construct an
auction scheme called SEAL that works without any trusted party,
and secure against passive adversaries. David, Gentile, and Pour-
pouneh propose FAST [8] that builds on SEAL to provide security
against active adversaries. While FAST also informally argues that
the protocol enforces honest behavior among rational bidders, a for-
mal rational security analysis is missing. Like SEAL and FAST, our
protocol uses the Anonymous Veto Protocol (AVP) introduced in [19]
as a building block. Our protocol is more efficient than both SEAL
and FAST, and is proven to be secure in the presence of rational
adversaries.
1.3 Comparison with other approaches
We now compare with other straightforward approaches, highlight
why they do not work and their shortcomings.
Timed primitives. Timed commitments [7, 27]: These are an ex-
tension to standard commitments to have a forced opening phase
wherein one can solve a time lock puzzle in order to “open" the
commitment. It may appear that these automatically give sealed bid
auctions achieving fairness. However, there are several issues with
this approach. First, they offer privacy only for a certain period
of time. While this may be sufficient for some applications, our
auctions are designed to satisfy long-term privacy.
Covert secure MPC. An MPC protocol is said to be secure against
covert adversaries if honest parties are guaranteed to detect mali-
cious behavior. If we impose monetary penalties on such detected
parties, do we achieve our goal? It does not. First, such protocols
only detect cheating with a constant probability, and when cheating
goes undetected, the adversary learns private inputs. Increasing the
detection probability to be all but negligible, will result in higher
communication cost in existing covert secure protocols [15]. In the
vanilla covert mode (without identifiable abort) [34], the detection
is not necessarily unanimous among honest parties. Therefore, it
is unclear how the penalty is imposed, and who it is distributed
to. One way to fix this is by requiring protocols with identifiable
abort/public verifiability, but these are achieved through the use of
expensive TLPs.
However, in general it is non-trivial to modify protocols based
on timed commitments and covert secure MPC to achieve privacy
preserving auctions.
UsingNIZKs.Using NIZKs on top of the ABP protocol as described
in Section 1.1 makes the protocol inefficient. The languages that
need NIZKs (like composition of proofs of knowledge of discrete
log or opening of a Pedersen commitment) admit Sigma proto-
cols. However, concretely, since a NIZK proof needs to be sent per
party per round, this adds to the communication overhead (roughly,
2𝑛ℓ |G| where 𝑛 is the number of parties, ℓ is the bit length of the
bid and |G| is the size of the group used by the protocol). Prior
work on auctions, FAST [8] and SEAL [5] do make use of NIZKs in
their protocols, but are inefficient. Moreover, even with NIZKs, the
resulting ABP-based protocol admits leakage on the second highest
bid. Our approach avoids this overhead, results in a reduced number
of public key operations thus giving better concrete efficiency, and
provides full privacy.

Notation. We denote the security parameter by _. Let G be the
description of the group of order 𝑞, and 𝑔,𝑔1, ℎ be the generators of
G. A function negl is said to be negligible if negl(𝑛) < 1/𝑝 (𝑛) for
all positive polynomial functions 𝑝 (·) and for all 𝑛 > 𝑛0 for some

use ≈𝑐 to denote computational indistinguishability between two

We now describe some game theoretic notations and definitions
used in our work. We assume that there are 𝑛 parties (𝑃1, . . . , 𝑃𝑛)
participating in a game.
Definition 2.1 (Normal Form Game [20]). A normal form game is
a tuple
{
{Γ𝑖 }𝑛𝑖=1, {𝑈𝑖 }𝑛𝑖=1
}
where for each party 𝑃𝑖 , a set of possible
actions Γ𝑖 along with a utility function 𝑈𝑖 are specified.
Depending on its private inputs, each party 𝑃𝑖 uses strategy
𝜋𝑖 ∈ Γ𝑖 where Γ𝑖 is the space of strategies available for party 𝑃𝑖 ,
during the game. We also assign utility functions 𝑈𝑖 (𝜋𝑖 , 𝜋−𝑖 ) to
each party 𝑃𝑖 . These functions represent the perceived utility of
game for the party. We say that the party 𝑃𝑖 prefers the action 𝜋i
over action 𝜋i
′
if and only if𝑈𝑖 (𝜋i) > 𝑈𝑖 (𝜋i′).
Definition 2.2 (Dominant Strategy [20]). Given a normal form
game: {
{Γ𝑖 }𝑛𝑖=1, {𝑈𝑖 }𝑛𝑖=1
}
we say 𝜋𝑖 ∈ Γ𝑖 is a Dominant Strategy if 𝑈𝑖 (𝜋𝑖 , 𝜋−𝑖 ) > 𝑈𝑖 (𝜋 ′𝑖 , 𝜋−𝑖 )
for all 𝜋𝑖 ≠ 𝜋 ′
𝑖
∈ Γ𝑖 and for all 𝜋−𝑖 ∈ Γ−𝑖 .
Such a strategy 𝜋𝑖 guarantees that the party 𝑃𝑖 can accrue best
utility among all strategies available to it. In the above case, 𝜋 ′
𝑖
is
also termed as Dominated Strategy. Dominated strategies are typi-
cally avoided by the rational parties, whereas dominant strategies
are pursued.
We also have a weaker notion of Dominant Strategy known as
Weakly Dominant Strategy.

Definition 2.3 (Weakly Dominant Strategy [20]). Given a normal
form game: {
{Γ𝑖 }𝑛𝑖=1, {𝑈𝑖 }𝑛𝑖=1
}
we say 𝜋𝑖 ∈ Γ𝑖 is a Weakly Dominant Strategy if 𝑈𝑖 (𝜋𝑖 , 𝜋−𝑖 ) ≥
𝑈𝑖 (𝜋 ′𝑖 , 𝜋−𝑖 ) for all 𝜋𝑖 ≠ 𝜋 ′
𝑖
∈ Γ𝑖 and for all 𝜋−𝑖 ∈ Γ−𝑖 .
In addition, there exists some 𝜋−𝑖 ∈ Γ−𝑖 such that 𝑈𝑖 (𝜋𝑖 , 𝜋−𝑖 ) >
𝑈𝑖 (𝜋 ′𝑖 , 𝜋−𝑖 ).
As can be seen, a Weakly Dominated Strategy can realize the
same utility as the Dominant Strategy for certain strategies.
Definition 2.4 (Weakly Dominant Strategy Equilibrium (W-DSE) [32]).
For a normal form game
{
{Γ𝑖 }𝑛𝑖=1, {𝑈𝑖 }𝑛𝑖=1
}
, the strategy profile
𝜋 = (𝜋1, . . . , 𝜋𝑛) ∈ Γ is aWeakly Dominant Strategy Equilibrium if
∀𝑃𝑖 , 𝑖 ∈ [𝑛], 𝜋𝑖 is a Weakly Dominant Strategy for party 𝑃𝑖 .
A Dominant Strategy Equilibrium, whenever it is present, guar-
antees that every party has a unique Dominant Strategy available
to it. Thus, each party can realize maximum utility by adopting
its Dominant Strategy. Since such a strategy becomes a preferred
choice for every party in the game, the chosen strategy profile is
an equilibrium. In our case, we show that every party has a weakly
dominant strategy – which is to follow the protocol.
2.2 Building Blocks
Here we describe some of the key building blocks that we make
use of in our protocol.
Definition 2.5 (Commitment scheme). LetM, C, R be the message
space, commitment space and randomness space respectively.
A commitment scheme consists of a tuple (Setup,Commit,Open)
of PPT algorithms where:
• Setup(1_) → pp generates public parameters pp
• Commit(pp;𝑚) → (𝑐; 𝑟 ) takes a message𝑚 ∈ M, random-
ness 𝑟 ∈ R and outputs a commitment 𝑐 ∈ C
• Open(pp, 𝑐,𝑚, 𝑟 ) → 𝐵 ∈ {0, 1} checks if the commitment 𝑐
opens to the message𝑚
The security of commitment scheme guarantees two proper-
ties: hiding and binding. Informally, the hiding property guarantees
that for any two messages 𝑚0,𝑚1, no PPT algorithm can distin-
guish between commitments to𝑚0 and𝑚1. The binding property
guarantees that no PPT algorithm can open a commitment to two
different messages. We use the Pedersen Commitment Scheme that
is computationally binding and perfectly hiding.
Definition 2.6 (Pedersen Commitment Scheme [33]). The Pedersen
Commitment Scheme Com instantiates the Commitment Scheme
defined above as:
• 𝑐 = Com(𝑚, 𝑟 ) = 𝑔𝑚ℎ𝑟 where𝑚 ∈ Z𝑞 , 𝑟 ←𝑅 Z𝑞 is chosen
uniformly at random and 𝑐 ∈ G.
• Open(𝑐,𝑚, 𝑟 ) → 𝐵 ∈ {0, 1} verifies if 𝑐 is indeed the right
commitment for message𝑚 with opening randomness 𝑟 .
The Vector Pedersen Commitment Scheme allows one to commit
tom = (𝑚1, . . . ,𝑚𝑛) ∈ Z𝑛𝑞 as follows: given generators ℎ,𝑔1, . . . , 𝑔𝑛 ,
such that the discrete logarithm between any two generators is
unknown, 𝑐 = Com(m, 𝑟 ) = ℎ𝑟
∏𝑛
𝑖=1 𝑔
𝑚𝑖
𝑖
.
Oblivious Transfer. We make use of Oblivious Transfer for se-
curely sharing messages between parties. Let M,R be the message
space and randomness space respectively. An OT protocol proceeds
as follows for two PPT parties 𝑅 and 𝑆 :
• OT.R1 (𝛼, 𝛽) → (𝑜𝑡𝑟1, 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒) is invoked by 𝑅 with inputs
𝛼 ∈ {0, 1}, randomness 𝛽 ∈ R. 𝑜𝑡𝑟1 is the first message sent
by 𝑅 to 𝑆 . 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒 denotes the state of protocol.
• OT.S(𝑚0,𝑚1, 𝛾) → 𝑜𝑡𝑠 takes messages𝑚0,𝑚1 ∈ M, random-
ness 𝛾 ∈ R and outputs message to be sent by 𝑆 to 𝑅.
• OT.R2 (𝑜𝑡𝑠, 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒) →𝑚𝛼 uses the message from 𝑆 and inter-
nal state to retrieve the message𝑚𝛼 .
The security of OT protocol ensures that the receiver does not learn
about𝑚1−𝛼 and sender does not learn about 𝛼 .
Collision Resistant Hash Function. A collision resistant hash
function (CRH) is a function family for which it is hard to find
inputs that map to the same output. More formally, a familyH𝑘 is
a CRH if for every PPT A, Prhash←H𝑘
((𝑥1, 𝑥2) ← A(hash) |𝑥1 ≠
𝑥2, hash(𝑥1) = hash(𝑥2)) ≤ negl(_) where each hash maps ℓ bit
strings to 𝑘 bit strings.
Bulletin Board. The Bulletin Board (BB) is an abstraction for au-
thenticated broadcast channel with memory. In our protocol, parties
can write messages on to the BB for public consumption. The BB is
expected to satisfy following properties: (i) Every message written
on the BB is associated to a party and is readable by all other parties.
(ii) The messages written on BB are immutable. A bulletin board
can be realized using blockchains. However, for several real-world
use cases of auctions – tech auctions, sporting auctions, for exam-
ple – we might be willing to place a minimal assumption on the
availability of a bulletin board (a website, for example).
3 AUCTION PROTOCOL
We first describe our security model. We then present some build-
ing blocks used by the protocol followed by a detailed protocol
specification.
3.1 Security Model
We consider rational PPT parties that are not viewed as being
either honest or corrupt; instead, they are simply rational and are
motivated by some utility function.
We are interested in strategies that are self-enforcing – i.e., each
party chooses such a strategy that there is no incentive to deviate
from it. In other words, the choice of strategies is an equilibrium.We
seek a Dominant Strategy Equilibrium for computationally bounded
parties for non-adaptive strategies. However, such a preference to
follow the protocol among parties, in itself does not address privacy
concerns of the parties. We need more guarantees from the protocol
for addressing privacy. For this, we introduce the notion of Privacy
Enhanced Computational Weakly Dominant Strategy Equilibrium,
inspired by the work of [29].
Definition 3.1 (Privacy Enhanced Computational Weakly Domi-
nant Strategy Equilibrium). Let (𝑃1, . . . , 𝑃𝑛) be a set of rational PPT
parties with their respective efficiently computable utility functions
𝑈𝑖 . Let 𝜋𝑖 ∈ Γ𝑖 be the strategy for 𝑃𝑖 of following Π. Let 𝜋 ′
𝑖
∈ Γ𝑖 be
an arbitrary efficiently computable strategy.
 
1178
Secure Auctions in the Presence of Rational Adversaries CCS ’22, November 7–11, 2022, Los Angeles, CA, USA
We say that the protocol Π is a Privacy Enhanced Computational
Weakly Dominant Strategy Equilibrium if the following hold with
probability (1 − negl(_)), where _ is the security parameter.
(1) Π is a Weakly Dominant Strategy Equilibrium; i.e.,
𝑈𝑖 (𝜋𝑖 , 𝜋−𝑖 ) ≥ 𝑈𝑖 (𝜋 ′𝑖 , 𝜋−𝑖 )
for all arbitrary efficiently computable 𝜋−𝑖 .
(2) For every 𝑃𝑖 , there exists a simulator Sim𝑃𝑖 such that the view
of 𝑃𝑖 in a real execution of the protocol is computationally
indistinguishable from the output of the simulator:
ViewΠ
𝑃𝑖 ,real
≈𝑐 SimΠ
𝑃𝑖
where View𝑃𝑖 ,real is the random variable of the transcript of 𝑃𝑖 in
protocol Π.
3.2 Anonymous Bidding Protocol
In constructing our protocol, we use the Anonymous Bidding Pro-
tocol (ABP) to compute the highest bid value which is a variation
of the Anonymous Veto Protocol (AVP) first described in [19] and
later used with modifications in [5] and [8].
ABP runs for 𝑙 rounds – where 𝑙 is the number of bits in the
binary representation of the bid values. The protocol proceeds as
below:
• Each bidder 𝑃𝑖 participates in ABP by inputting one bit from
their bid value at a time. This continues until he is in the
race. If in a round, there is a bidder who inputs a 1 while the
party 𝑃𝑖 has 0 in that index, he drops out of the race at the
end of that round.
• A party who has lost out on the race, continues to participate
in the protocol but only contributes a 0 to the rest of the
computation.
• Any round 1 ≤ 𝑗 ≤ 𝑙 which has at least one bidder bidding
a 1 bit is considered as the decider round.
• Thus, a bidder 𝑃𝑖 uses the bid 𝑑𝑖 𝑗 during round 𝑗 as
𝑑𝑖 𝑗 =

0, if 𝑃𝑖 is not in race
or 𝑃𝑖 bid 0 in any of previous decider rounds.
𝑏𝑖 𝑗 , if 𝑃𝑖 is in the race
or 𝑃𝑖 bid 1 in all previous decider rounds.
• Logical OR of all individual bids used in 𝑗th round is evalu-
ated to be the 𝑗th winning bit. i.e.,
𝑏𝑤𝑗 =
𝑛∨
𝑖=1
𝑑𝑖 𝑗
Observe that, decider round 𝑗 has the corresponding winning
bit 𝑏𝑤𝑗 = 1.
• Winning bid 𝑏𝑤 is computed as 𝑏𝑤 = 𝑏𝑖1 | | · · · | |𝑏𝑖𝑙
Wemake use of this protocol for computing the highest bid value.
Although the ABP protocol has been described above using raw
bits, for the actual computation, raw bits are not used. Instead we
make use of encoded bits that hide the actual bit values – thus
preserving privacy.
3.3 Bit Encoding Scheme
In order to ensure the privacy of the bits used during computation,
we require the bits to be encoded such that no PPT party can distin-
guish between the encoding of 0 and encoding of 1. For this wemake
use of Bit Encoding Scheme (BES). This scheme is adopted from [5].
It follows from the DDH assumption holding in the group G that
the distributions of 0-bit code and 1-bit code are computationally
indistinguishable. The encoding and corresponding computation
on the coded bits are performed as follows:
(1) Each bidder 𝑃𝑖 , 𝑖 ∈ [𝑛] allocates private keys 𝑥𝑖 𝑗 , 𝑟𝑖 𝑗 ←𝑅 Z𝑞 ,
𝑖 ∈ [𝑛], 𝑗 ∈ [𝑙]. Public keys 𝑋𝑖 𝑗 = 𝑔𝑥𝑖 𝑗 are published to the
bulletin board.
(2) Once public keys from all bidders are available, each bidder
computes:
𝑌𝑖 𝑗 =
∏𝑖−1
𝑘=1
𝑋𝑘 𝑗∏𝑛
𝑘=𝑖+1 𝑋𝑘 𝑗
(3) Each contributed bit 1 𝑑𝑖 𝑗 is encoded as :𝐵𝑖 𝑗 = BESEncode(𝑑𝑖 𝑗 )
where
BESEncode(𝑏𝑖 𝑗 ) =
{
0-bit code : 𝑌
𝑥𝑖 𝑗
𝑖 𝑗
if 𝑑𝑖 𝑗 = 0
1-bit code : 𝑔𝑟𝑖 𝑗 if 𝑑𝑖 𝑗 = 1
(4) The 𝑗th winning bit is computed as the logical-OR of indi-
vidual bidding bits 𝑏𝑖 𝑗 for the 𝑗th position: 𝑏𝑤𝑗 =
∨𝑛
𝑖=1 𝑏𝑖 𝑗 .
This is computed using the bit codes as follows:
𝑏𝑤𝑗 =
{
0, if
∏𝑛
𝑖=1 𝐵𝑖 𝑗 = 1
1, if
∏𝑛
𝑖=1 𝐵𝑖 𝑗 ≠ 1
We refer the reader to [5] for proofs establishing the indistinguisha-
bility of the distributions of 0-code and 1-code which follows from
DDH.
3.4 Privacy Preserving First Price Auction
Protocol
In this section, we describe the protocol Π for running a First Price
Auction. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that the bid values
are all distinct. However, we can easily extend our protocol to
include a simple tie-breaking mechanism. We also make use of
fixed value of security deposit amount of 𝐷 for all parties. Since
most practical auctions have a reserve price, that is the minimum
bidding amount, the deposit 𝐷 can be chosen to be equal to the
reserve price of the auction. Of this deposit, 𝐷/2 is used exclusively
in the last phase of the protocol where the potential winner (who
claims to have the winning bid) engages with the evaluator to verify
that he does indeed have the winning bid. The remainder of the
deposit is something that any party may forfeit if they are caught
cheating in other parts of the protocol.
Protocol Specification The protocol for running first price auc-
tions is specified below. We make use of a maliciously secure OT
protocol Π𝑂𝑇 : (OT.R1,OT.R2,OT.S).
We note that selecting public parameters(pp) in our protocol
does not require any central authority or use of a separate protocol.
Our pp – comprising of a DDH hard group G, generator 𝑔 – can be
generated using off-the-shelf parameters as recommended by NIST
1
We denote by 𝑑𝑖 𝑗 the bit that a party 𝑃𝑖 contributes or uses in round 𝑗 ; this may or
may not be equal to 𝑏𝑖 𝑗 which is 𝑃 ′𝑖 s true bid value in index 𝑗

(e.g. secp256k1 elliptic curve).
Setup Phase:
(1) Each party 𝑃𝑖 is initialized with its private valuation of
auctioned item 𝑣𝑖 , bid value 𝑏𝑖 .
(2) Each party 𝑃𝑖 registers for the auction by depositing its
security deposit 𝐷 . In turn 𝑃𝑖 receives the public param-
eters pp = (𝑞,G, 𝑔, 𝑔1, ℎ).
(3) The party 𝑃𝑖 samples the private keys 𝑥𝑖 𝑗 , 𝑟𝑖 𝑗 ←𝑅 Z𝑞 ,
𝑗 ∈ [𝑙]
(4) 𝑃𝑖 generates a CR hash for the concatenated private ran-
domness
• For 𝑖 ≠ 𝑒 , 𝜌i = 𝑥𝑖1 | | · · · | |𝑥𝑖𝑙 | |𝑟𝑖1 | | · · · | |𝑟𝑖𝑙 | |𝛾𝑖1 | | · · · | |𝛾𝑖𝑙 .
Note that 𝑥𝑖 𝑗 s and 𝑟𝑖 𝑗 s are used to encode bit 0 and
bit 1, respectively. 𝛾𝑖 𝑗 s are used as randomness for
generation of OT messages by OT sender 𝑃𝑖 .
• For 𝑖 = 𝑒 , 𝜌i = 𝑥𝑖1 | | · · · | |𝑥𝑖𝑙 | |𝑟𝑖1 | | · · · | |𝑟𝑖𝑙 | |𝛽11 | | · · · | |𝛽𝑛𝑙 .
Again, 𝑥𝑖 𝑗 s and 𝑟𝑖 𝑗 s are used to encode bit 0 and bit
1, respectively. 𝛽𝑘 𝑗 s are used as randomness for gen-
eration of OT messages by OT receiver (evaluator 𝑃𝑒 )
while interacting with the party 𝑃𝑘 .
• 𝐻𝑖 = hash(𝜌𝑖 )
(5) Party 𝑃𝑖 chooses 𝑅𝑖 ←𝑅 Z𝑞 . Computes commitment
(as per Definition 2.6) 𝑐𝑖 = Com(𝑏𝑖 , 𝐻𝑖 , 𝑅𝑖 ) = 𝑔𝑏𝑖𝑔
𝐻𝑖
1
ℎ𝑅𝑖 .
These commitments are written to BB.
(6) Writes the public keys 𝑋𝑖 𝑗 = 𝑔𝑥𝑖 𝑗 for 1 ≤ 𝑗 ≤ 𝑙 to BB.
We denote the evaluator by 𝑃𝑒 .
Computation Phase
(1) For 𝑗 ∈ [𝑙], each party 𝑃𝑖 chooses his contributing bid-
ding bit 𝑑𝑖 𝑗 following ABP as specified in §3.2. 𝑃𝑖 gen-
erates the bit codes 𝐵𝑖 𝑗 ← BESEncode(𝑑𝑖 𝑗 ) (with either
𝑥𝑖 𝑗 or 𝑟𝑖 𝑗 as appropriate).
(2) 𝑃𝑒 plays the role of the Receiver in pair-wise OT with all
other parties 𝑃𝑖 , 𝑖 ≠ 𝑒 , to obtain the bit codes as follows
for rounds 𝑗 = 1 to 𝑙 :
• 𝑃𝑒 sets 𝛼 𝑗 = 𝑑𝑒 𝑗 , 𝛽𝑖 𝑗 ←𝑅 Z𝑞 and invokes
OT.R1 (𝛼 𝑗 , 𝛽𝑖 𝑗 )
• OT sender 𝑃𝑖 sets 𝑀

to ob-
tain 𝐶

, which are written to BB.
• When 𝛼 𝑗 = 0, 𝑃𝑒 retrieves the bit code 𝐵𝑖 𝑗 , 𝑖 ≠ 𝑒 from
OT using OT.R2 (𝐶 (0)𝑖 𝑗
), computes the bit 𝑏𝑤𝑗 as men-
tioned in BES description §3.3 and writes the same to
BB. If the bit 𝑏𝑤𝑗 = 0, 𝑃𝑒 also writes the bit-codes for
each bidder to the BB as a proof of correct computation
of 0-bit.
• When 𝛼 𝑗 = 1, 𝑃𝑒 writes 𝑏𝑤𝑗 = 1 to BB.
After 𝑙 rounds, the protocol proceeds to Verification
Phase.
(3) If any party 𝑃𝑖 fails to write its messages or if 𝑃𝑒 doesn’t
output the bit 𝑏𝑤𝑗 to BB within 𝜏 time units, they are
considered to have aborted and protocol proceeds to
terminate and the deposits are redistributed.
(4) After 𝑙 rounds, each party constructs the value of win-
ning bid as 𝑏𝑤 = 𝑏𝑤1 | |𝑏𝑤2 | | . . . | |𝑏𝑤𝑙 .
 
1180
Secure Auctions in the Presence of Rational Adversaries CCS ’22, November 7–11, 2022, Los Angeles, CA, USA
Verification Phase – Winner verification
(1) The party 𝑃𝑤 claims auction by opening its commitment.
𝑃𝑤 writes 𝑅𝑤 to BB.
(2) If winner is not the evaluator , 𝑃𝑤 opens its OT sender
randomness 𝛾𝑤𝑗 for all 𝑗 ∈ [𝑙] and writes the same to
BB.
(3) 𝑃𝑤 writes all its private keys 𝑥𝑤𝑗 , 𝑟𝑤𝑗 for rounds 𝑗 ∈ [𝑙]
to BB.
(4) Evaluator verifies validity of private randomness:
𝐻𝑤
?
= hash (𝑥𝑖1 | | · · · | |𝑥𝑖𝑙 | |𝑟𝑖1 | | · · · | |𝑟𝑖𝑙 | |𝛾𝑖1 | | · · · | |𝛾𝑖𝑙 )
(5) Evaluator uses the OT sender randomness 𝛾𝑤𝑗 and 𝐶
(0)
𝑖 𝑗
to retrieve the bit codes used by 𝑃𝑤 during the computa-
tion phase.
(6) Evaluator also uses the private keys shared by 𝑃𝑤 to
compute the bit codes and checks if they match with
retrieved bit codes. For each 𝑗 ∈ [𝑙]:
if 𝑏𝑤𝑗 = 1 : 𝐵𝑖 𝑗 = 𝑔𝑟𝑖 𝑗
if 𝑏𝑤𝑗 = 0 : 𝐵𝑖 𝑗 = 𝑌
𝑥𝑖 𝑗
𝑖 𝑗
,where 𝑌𝑖 𝑗 =
∏𝑖−1
𝑘=1
𝑋𝑘 𝑗∏𝑛
𝑘=𝑖+1 𝑋𝑘 𝑗
and 𝑋𝑘 𝑗 is public key for round 𝑗 posted by parties 𝑃𝑘 .
If there is a match, confirms that 𝑃𝑤 is the winner.
(7) If there is discrepancy in some round 𝑗 , Evaluator flags
the same against 𝑃𝑤 . In case there is any rebuttal from
𝑃𝑤 , then evaluator opens its OT sender randomness 𝛽𝑤𝑗
during round 𝑗 to prove that 𝑃𝑤 is indeed cheating. In
such a case, 𝑃𝑤 loses its entire deposit 𝐷 such that, 𝐷/2
is redistributed among remaining parties and 𝐷/2 is paid
out to evaluator to compensate for its loss of information
during rebuttal.
(8) In case evaluator 𝑃𝑒 is the winner, 𝑃𝑒 opens its OT first
message randomness 𝛽𝑖 𝑗 for all 𝑖 ∈ [𝑛] \ {𝑒} to prove
that winning bits are same as those used as choice bits
of OT.
Note that if cheating is detected by any of the parties,
the protocol terminates and the deposits are appropri-
ately redistributed. If there is no cheating, the protocol
terminates and 𝑃𝑤 wins the auction.
Verification Phase – No Claim verification
(1) If 𝑃𝑤 doesn’t announce itself, each party provides proof
of not winning for the last decider round 𝑗 to prove that
it has used 0-bit code in that round.
(a) Each party 𝑃𝑖 writes its secret key 𝑥𝑖 𝑗 used to generate
the 0-bit code to BB.
(b) Evaluator 𝑃𝑒 opens its OT first message to prove that it
has used choice bit as 0 during round 𝑗 . 𝑃𝑒 also opens
its OT receiver randomness 𝛽𝑖 𝑗 for each party during
round 𝑗 .
(c) Party 𝑃𝑖 , 𝑖 ≠ 𝑒 opens randomness used for sending OT
messages, 𝛾𝑖 𝑗 . This helps to reconstruct the bit code.
These values are written to BB.
(d) 𝑃𝑖 ’s proof can be verified as: Compute 𝑀
(0)
𝑖 𝑗
, use the
secret key 𝑥𝑖 𝑗 to generate the 0-bit code 𝐵𝑖 𝑗 and check
if 𝐵𝑖 𝑗
?
= 𝑀
(0)
𝑖 𝑗
. 𝑃𝑖 is deemed cheating if the equality
doesn’t hold.
(2) If every party 𝑃𝑖 is able to send correct proof of not-
winning, this means, the computed value 𝑏𝑤 is incorrect.
This can happen only when 𝑃𝑒 has cheated. Thus, in such
a case, 𝑃𝑒 is considered to be cheating. The protocol ter-
minates and the deposits are appropriately redistributed.

sion of paper.
4 SECURITY AGAINST RATIONAL
ADVERSARIES
The security of our construction relies on the DDH assumption as
well as security of the following building blocks: a) Security of the
commitment scheme Com, b) Malicious security of the OT protocol
Π𝑂𝑇 and c) Collision resistance of the hash function hash.
Our goal, informally, is to show that following properties hold:
(1) Eqilibrium (Part (1) of Definition 3.1). We first show that
the dominant strategy is for parties to follow the protocol.
This property relies on the security of our ABP encoding
scheme (DDH), security of Pedersen commitments, collision
resistance of the hash function as well as malicious security
of the OT protocol .
(2) Simulation (Part (2) of Definition 3.1). When parties follow
the protocol, we show privacy using the simulation para-
digm. Specifically, we show the existence of a simulator such
that the view of the parties in the real world is indistinguish-
able from that output by the simulator. Here we use hiding
property of Pedersen commitments, only semi-honest se-
curity of the OT protocol and indistinguishability of ABP
encoding scheme (DDH).

4.1 Existence of Weakly Dominant Strategy
Equilibrium (weak DSE)
We begin by setting some notation.
• 𝑏𝑖 : Bid value of party 𝑃𝑖 .
• 𝑣𝑖 : Perceived private valuation of the auction item by 𝑃𝑖 .
Note that, motivation for 𝑃𝑖 to participate in auction requires
𝑣𝑖 > 𝑏𝑖 .
• 𝑢𝑖 : Γ × {0, 1}∗ ↦→ R is the monetary utility function of party
𝑃𝑖 mapping a strategy and all information on the BB to a
value.
• 𝑧𝑖 : Γ × {0, 1}∗ ↦→ R is the information utility function of
party 𝑃𝑖 mapping a strategy and all information on the BB
to a value.
• 𝑈𝑖 : Γ × {0, 1}∗ ↦→ R is the total utility function.
• C: Set of parties caught deviating.
A party’s utility function considers the gains or losses incurred
by the party because of its actions. In addition to monetary con-
siderations, parties are also curious to learn information about the
bid values of other parties. For this, we consider a information
utility function 𝑧𝑖 . The total utility is a linear combination of the
two components. Parties can have arbitrary privacy concerns (and
value information differently). However, we assume certain restric-
tions on 𝑧𝑖 , like not valuing “less” information higher than learning
“more" information. These are reasonable, since it does not make
sense to value learning, for instance, first bit of a certain party more
than learning the first two bits of the same party. Similarly, parties
do not value positively leaking their own information. Finally, we
assume that parties value the monetary component of the utilities
higher than the information component. That is, primarily, they
want to win the auction; secondarily, they are concerned about
revealing their information and learning information about other
parties’ inputs.
We now consider the monetary utility function of an individual
party 𝑃𝑖 from participating in Π:
𝑢𝑖 =

= 𝑣𝑖 − 𝑏𝑖 max(𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑛) = 𝑏𝑖 and 𝑃𝑖 doesn’t deviate
= 0 max(𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑛) ≠ 𝑏𝑖 and 𝑃𝑖 doesn’t deviate
= −𝐷/2 𝑃𝑖 deviates and gets caught
= −𝐷 𝑃𝑒 identifies 𝑃𝑖 ’s cheating
but 𝑃𝑖 rebuts and loses
= 𝐷/2 if 𝑖 ≠ 𝑒 , 𝑃𝑒 identifies cheater.
But cheater does not rebut
=
𝐷 | C |
2(𝑛−|C) | 𝑃𝑖 doesn’t deviate, C is set of parties caught
deviating
In an ideal execution with a trusted party, each party 𝑃𝑖 learns
the winning bid value and the identity of the winning party. Let
this information be valued at 𝑍𝑖 ∈ R+ by 𝑃𝑖 . By correctness of our
protocol, the information utility of the honest strategy of following
the protocol is 𝑍𝑖 . We show that a deviating bidder never realizes
more utility than when it is not deviating (Lemmas 4.2, 4.1 for
monetary utility, and Lemma 4.3 for information utility).
Remark. We emphasize that an evaluator is also a bidder in the
auction. Hence, all arguments in the security proofs below are
applicable to evaluator as well. Wherever necessary, the role of
evaluator and its impact on security are analyzed separately.
4.2 Strategies for Rational Parties
During each round of the protocol, a party can choose either a 0-bit
code, a 1-bit code or choose to abort based on its private random
coins. A winning bidder not playing evaluator role has a deviat-
ing strategy incorrectRebuttal. Additionally, if a party is also the
evaluator (𝑃𝑒 ), it can choose to compute the winning bid correctly
or incorrectly. Since we are not considering any collusion among
the parties, such a choice would be independent of choices made
by other parties. As a result, we have following set of strategies
available to the parties at the beginning of each round:
Γ𝑖 = {𝑠0→0, 𝑠0→1, 𝑠1→0, 𝑠1→1, incorrectRebuttal, abort},∀𝑖 ∈ [𝑛] \ 𝑒
Γ𝑒 ={𝑠0→0, 𝑠0→1, 𝑠1→0, 𝑠1→1, abort, correctCompute,
incorrectCompute, correctVerify, incorrectVerify}
where (i)𝑠𝑎→𝑏 denotes that the protocol requires bidder to use a bit
𝑎 and bidder uses bit 𝑏. (ii)abort: The bidder stops participating in
the protocol. (iii) correctCompute: The evaluator chooses to com-
pute the winning bid value correctly. (iv) incorrectCompute: The
evaluator chooses to compute the winning bid value incorrectly. (v)
correctVerify: The evaluator chooses to verify winner’s claim cor-
rectly. (vi) incorrectVerify: The evaluator chooses to verify winner’s
claim incorrectly. Among these 𝑠0→0, 𝑠1→1, correctCompute and
correctVerify correspond to honest behavior or no deviation; and,
𝑠0→1, 𝑠1→0, incorrectRebuttal, incorrectCompute and incorrectVerify
correspond to deviating strategies.
We can specify the strategies chosen by a party 𝑃𝑖 for the entire
auction as 𝜋𝑖 = (𝜋𝑖1, . . . , 𝜋𝑖𝑙 ). Let 𝜋𝑖 𝑗 denote the strategy used by
𝑃𝑖 while following the protocol during 𝑗th round and 𝜋 ′
𝑖 𝑗
denote
a deviating strategy. Then we have 𝜋𝑖 𝑗 ∈ {𝑠0→0, 𝑠1→1} and 𝜋 ′
𝑖 𝑗
∈
{𝑠0→1, 𝑠1→0, incorrectRebuttal, abort}. Because of its special role,
the evaluator 𝑃𝑒 has two additional strategies available to it apart
from the ones available to it as a bidder. Hence,
𝜋𝑒 𝑗 ∈ {𝑠0→0, 𝑠1→1, correctCompute, correctVerify} and
𝜋 ′𝑒 𝑗 ∈ {𝑠0→1, 𝑠1→0, incorrectCompute, abort, incorrectVerify}
For each party 𝑃𝑖 , the choice of strategies by all other parties
in the auction is denoted by 𝜋−𝑖 . To emphasize the fact that these
choices by other parties could be either honest or cheating strate-
gies, we denote it by 𝜋−𝑖 . Every rational bidder’s desire is to achieve
their maximum utility. This means that, rational bidders will avoid
any strategy that will push them out of the race. Once a party does
drop out of the race too, it will avoid strategies which would further
reduce its utility. (This, for example, is sure to happen if the party
cheats and is detected.) In the following, we will show that honestly
following the protocol is the Weakly Dominant Strategy. Utility
realized as a result of any deviation is no better than what can be
realized by following the protocol.
We want to establish that for a rational party, any deviation
is irrational; i.e., certainly not utility enhancing and potentially
utility diminishing. We will show this for the two deviations in
next two Lemmas. Firstly observe that, if any bidder 𝑃𝑖 aborts, the
 
1182
Secure Auctions in the Presence of Rational Adversaries CCS ’22, November 7–11, 2022, Los Angeles, CA, USA
bidder gains nothing from its participation in auction. Moreover,
the bidder ends up forfeiting its security deposit; thus having a
net negative utility. Hence abort as a strategy is always utility
decreasing and dominated by non-deviating strategies (either 𝑠0→0
or 𝑠1→1). Similarly the strategy incorrectRebuttal is not rational
either. For this, consider a party 𝑃𝑖 who claims win but is correctly
caught cheating by the evaluator. If 𝑃𝑖 chooses to rebut incorrectly,
the opening of OT first message randomness by evaluator would
certainly implicate 𝑃𝑖 making him lose full deposit 𝐷 . On the other
hand, 𝑃𝑖 can choose to accept the cheating and only lose deposit
of 𝐷/2. Thus this strategy would not be adopted by any rational
party.
We therefore need to focus our attention on only two strategies
for a regular party 𝑃𝑖 : 𝑠1→0, 𝑠0→1.
Proof while using Strategy 𝑠1→0 Consider an arbitrary bidder 𝑃𝑖
who has followed the protocol till some arbitrary round 𝑗 during the
computation phase and is still in the race. Suppose that 𝑃𝑖 has the
bit 𝑏𝑖 𝑗 = 1; i.e., 𝑃𝑖 needs to use 1-bit code for computation during
the 𝑗th round. Suppose 𝑃𝑖 ’s strategy during the round 𝑗 is 𝑠1→0 –
i.e., uses a 0-bit code instead of 1-bit code during round 𝑗 . For such
a deviation we establish the following result.
Lemma 4.1. For any PPT party 𝑃𝑖 , let 𝜋𝑖 be the honest strategy
profile, and 𝜋 ′
𝑖
be the strategy profile in which 𝑃𝑖 deviates using 𝑠1→0
in some round. Then, assuming that DDH assumption holds in G,
Com is a secure commitment scheme, and hash is a CRH, the strategy
𝜋𝑖 weakly dominates the strategy 𝜋 ′
𝑖
for all 𝑖 ∈ [𝑛] during all rounds
as per Definition 2.4.
Proof. Consider the round 𝑗 where 𝑃𝑖 deviates for the first time
and uses the deviating strategy 𝑠1→0. Let 𝜋−𝑖 denote strategies
of parties other than 𝑃𝑖 . Let us consider following cases on the
winning bid at the end of the protocol
(1) CASE: Winning Bid = 𝑏𝑖 . It is easy to see that, regardless of
his subsequent strategies, 𝑃𝑖 will be detected as a cheating
party and will have negative utility. If he chooses to not
declare himself the winner, he will be caught during proof
of not winning (because we assumed unique bids). If he
declares himself the winner, he will get caught in his post-
win verification protocol he runs with the evaluator. There’s
of course a chance that 𝑃𝑖 is the evaluator i.e., 𝑃𝑒 . In this case,
any cheating is easily detected by as the evaluator will not
be able to provide a proof of winning.
(2) CASE: Winning Bid ≠ 𝑏𝑖 . Here we need to consider a few
cases:
(a) 𝑃𝑖 was actually the highest bidder. In this case, 𝑃𝑖 would
have won the auction. It is easy to see that his utility in
this case is strictly less than what it would have been if
he was honest.
(b) 𝑃𝑖 was not the highest bidder and someone gets caught
for cheating. In this case, either 𝑃𝑖 also gets caught for
cheating or he doesn’t. In the former case, his utility has
diminished and in the latter case, his utility is no more
than what it would have been if he was honest.
(c) 𝑃𝑖 was not the highest bidder and someone else wins the
auction. In this case, his utility is no more than what it
would have been if he was honest.
To argue that the protocol is a weakly dominant strategy,
we need to show that there exists a strategy profile for other
players, where 𝑃 ′
𝑖
s utility from following the protocol is
strictly more than not following it. To see this, consider the
strategy profile 𝜋−𝑖 wherein every party other than 𝑃𝑖 uses
the strategy 𝑠1→0 during every round. In this case case if 𝑃𝑖
chooses to be honest, 𝑃𝑖 is guaranteed to win. On the other
hand, 𝑃𝑖 ’s deviation would result in either losing the auction
or getting caught to lose security deposit. Thus in this case,
𝑢𝑖 (𝜋𝑖 , 𝜋−𝑖 ) > 𝑢𝑖 (𝜋 ′𝑖 , 𝜋−𝑖 ).
Remark.What this lemma demonstrates is that no party has mone-
tary incentive to deviate using 𝑠1→0 as their first deviating strategy.
Going forward, we will show this for all strategies and this will
effectively mean that no party has a monetary incentive to devi-
ate. □
Proof while using Strategy 𝑠0→1 Now consider an arbitrary bid-
der 𝑃𝑖 who deviates for the first time in round 𝑗 and uses the strategy
𝑠0→1. We show that such a strategy is dominated by the honest
strategy.
Lemma 4.2. For any PPT party 𝑃𝑖 , let 𝜋𝑖 be the honest strategy
profile, and 𝜋 ′
𝑖
be the strategy profile in which 𝑃𝑖 deviates for the first
time in round 𝑗 and uses 𝑠0→1. Then, assuming that DDH assumption
holds in G, Com is a secure commitment scheme, and hash is a CRH,
the strategy 𝜋𝑖 weakly dominates the strategy 𝜋 ′
𝑖
as per Definition 2.4.
Proof. Let 𝜋−𝑖 denote strategies of parties other than 𝑃𝑖 . Con-
sider the round 𝑗 where 𝑃𝑖 has decided to use the deviating strategy
𝑠0→1 for the first time. We will show that irrespective of the strate-
gic choices of other bidders, 𝑃𝑖 cannot realize utility better than
what it would have done without deviation. We will consider the
following cases:
The first observation is that whenever a party plays this strategy,
he will forgo his chances of winning the auction. Even if his “fake”
bid is the winning bid, he will never be able to prove his claim.
Therefore, in this case, 𝑃𝑖 will either get caught cheating or he will
go under the radar, i.e., undetected. With the former, his utility
diminishes compared to what it would have been if he had played
honestly. With the latter, his utility is either the same as what it
would have been if he had been honest (if his “true” bid was never
the highest bid) or it diminishes (if his “true” bid was actually the
highest bid).
To show that following the protocol is a weakly dominant strat-
egy, we need to show that there exists a strategy profile for other
players, where 𝑃 ′
𝑖
s utility from following the protocol is strictly
more than not following it. To see this, consider the strategy pro-
file 𝜋−𝑖 wherein every party other than 𝑃𝑖 uses the strategy 𝑠1→0
during every round. In this case case if 𝑃𝑖 chooses to be honest,
𝑃𝑖 is guaranteed to win. On the other hand, 𝑃𝑖 ’s deviation would
result in either losing the auction or getting caught to lose security
deposit. Thus in this case, 𝑢𝑖 (𝜋𝑖 , 𝜋−𝑖 ) > 𝑢𝑖 (𝜋 ′𝑖 , 𝜋−𝑖 ).

Remark. To summarize, this lemma demonstrates that no party
has monetary incentive to deviate using 𝑠0→1 as their first deviating
strategy. □
We now show that there is no monetary incentive to deviate for
𝑃𝑒 . We defer the proof to the full version of paper.
Lemma 4.3. For PPT evaluator 𝑃𝑒 , let 𝜋𝑒 be the honest strategy
profile, and 𝜋 ′𝑒 be the strategy profile in which 𝑃𝑒 deviates in round 𝑗
for the first time and uses incorrectCompute in some round during
computation phase or using incorrectVerify during verification phase.
Then, assuming that DDH assumption holds in G, Com is a secure
commitment scheme, Π𝑂𝑇 is a malicious secure OT implementation
and hash is a CRH, the strategy 𝜋𝑒 dominates the strategy 𝜋 ′𝑒 . where
𝜋−𝑖 denotes arbitrary strategies of parties other than 𝑃𝑖 .
𝑢𝑒 (𝜋𝑒 , 𝜋−𝑒 ) ≥ 𝑢𝑒 (𝜋 ′𝑒 , 𝜋−𝑒 ) ∀𝜋−𝑒 ∈ Γ−𝑒
Remark. Combining the above lemmas, we have demonstrated
that no party has a monetary incentive to deviate using strategies
𝑠0→1, 𝑠1→0, incorrectCompute and incorrectVerify as their first de-
viating strategy. They may offer information utility which we dis-
cuss next.
4.3 Information Utility
Recall that the information utility realized by 𝑃𝑖 as a result of the
protocol run without any deviation is 𝑧𝑖 (𝜋𝑖 , 𝜋−𝑖 ) = 𝑍𝑖 . In the follow-
ing, we show that this is the maximum information utility that any
bidder can realize, unless the party 𝑃𝑖 is willing to loose monetary
utility.
Lemma 4.4. For any PPT party 𝑃𝑖 , let 𝜋𝑖 be the honest strategy pro-
file, and 𝜋 ′
𝑖
be the strategy profile in which 𝑃𝑖 deviates using 𝑠0→1 or
𝑠1→0 in some round. Let 𝑧𝑖 (𝜋 ′𝑖 , 𝜋−𝑖 ) be the information utility gained
by 𝑃𝑖 using the deviations. Then, assuming that DDH assumption
holds in G, Com is a secure commitment scheme, and hash is a CRH,
the information utility realized by 𝑃𝑖 is no more than what it would
have realized without deviation; i.e.,
𝑧𝑖 (𝜋 ′𝑖 , 𝜋−𝑖 ) ≤ 𝑍𝑖
(unless 𝑃𝑖 diminishes his monetary utility), where 𝜋−𝑖 denotes arbi-
trary strategies of parties other than 𝑃𝑖 .
Due to space constraints, we defer the proof to the full version of
paper, and provide a high-level idea of the proof here. We make use
of the fact that deviation using strategy 𝑠1→0 is not rational since
party has to forego auction to learn the information. On the other
hand, any deviation with 𝑠0→1 masks the bits used by other bidders.
Thus we show that any party learns no more information as a result
of deviation than it would have learnt by following the protocol.
We also argue that the not-winning-proofs provided in a scenario
resulting from adversarial action do not divulge any information
about the bid values.
PuttingTogether Proof ofRational Security. Lemmas 4.1, 4.2, 4.3
and 4.4 show that no rational party will deviate from the protocol.
Together, these establish Part (1) of Definition 3.1.
Theorem 4.5. Let 𝑃𝑖 , 𝑖 ∈ [𝑛] be any PPT party participating in the
first price auction, the protocol Π described in Figure 1. Then, assum-
ing that DDH assumption holds in G, Com is a secure commitment
scheme, Π𝑂𝑇 is a malicious secure OT implementation and hash is
a CRH, the protocol Π is a weakly dominant strategy equilibrium as
per Definition 2.4.
Proof. For party 𝑃𝑖 , let 𝜋𝑖 denote the strategy to follow the
protocol, and 𝜋 ′
𝑖
denote any arbitrary efficient deviation. Let 𝜋−𝑖 be
arbitrary efficient strategies of other parties. From Lemmas 4.1, 4.2,
and 4.3, we have ∀𝜋 ′
𝑖
∈ Γ𝑖 ,
𝑢𝑖 (𝜋𝑖 , 𝜋−𝑖 ) ≥ 𝑢𝑖 (𝜋 ′𝑖 , 𝜋−𝑖 )
From Lemma 4.4 we have,
𝑍𝑖 ≥ 𝑧𝑖 (𝜋 ′𝑖 )
It follows that, for all 𝑃𝑖 ,𝑈𝑖 (𝜋𝑖 , 𝜋−𝑖 ) ≥ 𝑈𝑖 (𝜋 ′𝑖 , 𝜋−𝑖 ),∀𝜋
′
𝑖
∈ Γ𝑖 and
∀𝜋−𝑖 ∈ Γ−𝑖 . We have that 𝜋𝑖 is a weakly dominant strategy for 𝑃𝑖
for all 𝑖 . Thus, Π is a Weakly Dominant Strategy Equilibrium. □
4.4 Privacy Enhanced weak DSE
Given the equilibrium from Theorem 4.5, to argue privacy, it suf-
fices to show that nothing beyond the output is learned by parties
who are non-deviating. We show security of our protocol against
such semi-honest parties who follow the protocol but might at-
tempt to learn more information from the protocol transcript, thus
establishing Part (2) of Definition 3.1. We use the ideal world – real
world paradigm.
Theorem 4.6. AssumingCom is secure commitment scheme, DDH
assumption holds in groupG, Π𝑂𝑇 is a semi-honest secure OT protocol
and hash is a CRH, protocol Π specified in Figure 1 securely realizes
the functionality F in the presence of semi-honest adversaries.
We present the ideal functionality F and the proof in the full
version of paper.
The following theorem stating that Π is a Privacy Enhanced Com-
putational Dominant Strategy Equilibrium, follows as a corollary of
Theorems 4.5 and 4.6.
Theorem 4.7. Let 𝑃𝑖 , 𝑖 ∈ [𝑛] be rational parties with respective
utility functions (𝑈1, . . . ,𝑈𝑛) as described above. Assuming Com is
a secure commitment scheme, DDH in group G, Π𝑂𝑇 is a maliciously
secure OT protocol and hash is a CRH, the protocol Π described in Fig-
ure 1 is a privacy enhanced computational weakly dominant strategy
equilibrium as per Definition 3.1.
5 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
Our protocol was implemented in C++ with 1840 lines of code. We
built upon OpenSSL and Boost open source libraries. The over-
whelming cost of the protocol is computation over the group (even
for 30 bidders, the total communication in the protocol was under
100 KB). Of this, exponentiation over Elliptic curve group using
the secp256k1 curve forms bulk of the cost. In Table 2, we compare
the number of exponentiations required by our protocol with other
prior protocols such as [5, 8] (even though they suffer from non
trivial leakage). Even so, we observe that our protocol makes 2X
lesser exponentiation calls than prior works.

We implemented our protocol and executed it on a single ma-

overall runtime of our protocol as a function of the number of bid-
ders for different number of bits used to represent the bid values.
This is plot of average of 3 runs for each number of bidders, with
number of bidders ranging from 5 − 70.

The run time for our protocol𝑇 is a function of number of group
exponentiations 𝑁 = 10𝑛𝑙 + 5𝑛 − 9𝑙 . For a fixed number of bits 𝑙 ,
the computation time𝑇 ∝ 𝑛. Thus the run time scales linearly with
the number of parties. This is corroborated by Figure 2.

Among similar works, we only compare with SEAL implemen-

have chosen the values of 𝑛 and 𝑙 to be same as the ones used
in SEAL implementation – for better comparison. Note however
that the choice of 𝑙 = 10 need not be a limitation since the bid
values can always be scaled by a constant factor. We have also
used Multi-Protocol SPDZ (MP-SPDZ) [21] library to benchmark
MPC protocols that can evaluate the max value (i.e. identify the
highest bid value) among a given set of 30 private inputs. The
MP-SPDZ is an implementation of several MPC protocol variants,
with a common high-level programming interface. Among these,
we use MASCOT [22] and BMR [26] protocols in malicious and
semi-honest security modes for comparison.
6 CONCLUSION
We construct a protocol for First Price Auction that is provably
secure in the rational setting. Our implementation demonstrates
that our construction is concretely efficient. We introduce the no-
tion of Privacy Enhanced Computational Weakly Dominant Strat-
egy Equilibrium as a solution concept, which we believe can be
used to construct and analyse other cryptographic protocols. Our
work leaves open several interesting questions about extending
the protocol to other flavors of auctions such as Vickrey auctions,
multi-unit auctions; and analysing other adversarial models like
adaptive strategies, and colluding rational parties.
