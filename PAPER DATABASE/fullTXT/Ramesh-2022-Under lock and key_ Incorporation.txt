By	 studying	 technological	 innovations,	 one	 thing	 is	 very	
evident:	if	there	is	to	be	a	blockchain	revolution,	many	barriers,	
including	technological,	governance,	organizational,	and	even	
societal	barriers	should	fall.	As	it	happened	with	e‑commerce	
and	 online	 travel	 agencies,	many	 common	 activities	 can	
face	drastic	 innovative	 changes,	 thanks	 to	 the	 technology	
that	 introduces	a	new	notion	of	decentralized	validation	of	
processes,	ownership,	and	trading.	In	this	manuscript,	we	have	
proposed	one	such	technology	called	the	blockchain	technology	
on	 (big)	data	management	 for	 collection,	validation,	 access	
control,	 and	elaboration	 in	 the	field	of	ophthalmic	artificial	
intelligence	(AI).	It	is	one	of	the	technologies	of	the	4th industrial 
revolution.
The	ophthalmology	health	 care	 sector	 currently	 faces	 a	
pressing	need	for	new	digital	technologies	that	allow	secure	
and	efficient	data	 sharing	 for	AI	management	and	big	data	
analytics.[1]	Blockchain	technology	promises	to	deliver	novel	
digital	 platforms	 that	 can	 address	 the	 inefficiencies	 and	
demands	of	the	current	ophthalmic	AI	systems.	In	the	field	of	
ophthalmology,	blockchain	technology	can	help	monitor	data	
and	the	integrity	of	the	results	in	AI.

Quick Response Code:
Big	data	has	been	a	game	changer	of	machine	learning.	But,	big	data	is	a	form	of	centralized	version	of	data	
only	available	and	accessible	to	the	technology	giants.	A	way	to	decentralize	this	data	and	make	machine	
learning	accessible	to	the	smaller	organizations	is	via	the	blockchain	technology.	This	peer‑to‑peer	network	
creates	a	common	database	accessible	to	those	in	the	network.	Furthermore,	blockchain	helps	in	securing	the	
digital	data	and	prevents	data	tampering	due	to	human	interactions.	This	technology	keeps	a	constant	track	
of	the	document	in	terms	of	creation,	editing,	etc.,	and	makes	this	information	accessible	to	all.	It	is	a	chain	
of	data	being	distributed	across	many	computers,	with	a	database	containing	details	about	each	transaction.	
This	record	helps	in	data	security	and	prevents	data	modification.	This	technology	also	helps	create	big	data	
from	multiple	 sources	of	 small	data	paving	way	 for	 creating	a	well	 serving	artificial	 intelligence	model.	
Here	in	this	manuscript,	we	discuss	about	the	usage	of	blockchain,	its	current	role	in	machine	learning	and	
challenges	faced	by	it.
Key words:	 Blockchain,	Artificial	 Intelligence,	 Big	 Data	Management,	 Cryptocurrency,	 Permissionless	
Blockchain	Network,	Permissioned	Blockchain
Invented	 in	 2008	by	 Satoshi	Nakamoto,	 blockchain	 is	 a	
decentralized	 ledger	with	 immutable	 properties	 allowing	
secure	verifiable	transfer	of	data	in	a	peer‑to‑peer	fashion	by	
utilizing	a	common	consensus	protocol	to	prevent	single	points	
of	failure.	Though	a	variety	of	use	cases	have	been	developed	
to	harness	the	advantages	of	blockchain	technology,	largely	in	
the	financial	sector	and	the	business	world;	it	is	particularly	
relevant	in	the	management	of	big	data	and	AI	research,	notably	
in	the	field	of	ophthalmology	due	to	its	abundance	of	numerical	
data	and	imagery.[2‑4]
Role of Blockchain Technology in 
Ophthalmic AI
Ophthalmic	AI	 is	a	growing	branch	with	active	 research.[5,6] 
It	 is	highly	 reliant	on	 the	 availability	 of	 large,	high‑quality	
datasets with rigorous model validations and multiple testing 
phases.[7‑9]	However,	 the	management	of	diverse	data	 from	
different	 countries	 and	 centres	 for	 training	 and	 testing	 of	
algorithms	poses	significant	challenges,	such	as	data	security	
threats	 and	patient	 confidentiality	 issues.	These	 challenges	
may	prevent	the	honest	transfer	of	research	medical	data	to	
support	collaborative	efforts.[10]	 In	addition,	due	to	a	 lack	of	
transparency	regarding	model	validation	and	testing,	proper

of	practitioners	and	organizations	that	capture	digital	data,	
which	 could	 be	 a	 barrier	 for	 blockchain	 technology.	 The	
highlight	features	of	this	manuscript	are	to	create	cognizance	
among	 ophthalmologists	 about	 the	 blockchain	 revolution	
in	the	field	of	ophthalmic	AI	and	its	importance	in	big	data	
management.	Thus,	more	practitioners	and	organizations	from	
developing	countries	are	encouraged	to	capture	and	store	as	
much	digital	data	as	possible	to	contribute	to	this	technology,	
as	 blockchain	 technology	 is	 a	peer‑to‑peer	 network	where	
everyone	is	connected	to	the	network	and	has	a	copy	of	the	
current	database	as	and	when	it	is	updated.
Many	 practical	 applicative	 fields	 where	 blockchain	
technology	has	already	been	incorporated	are	as	follows:
•	 Non‑fungible	token	(NFT)	marketplaces
•	 Music	royalties	tracking
•	 Cross‑border	payments
•	 Real‑time	data	streaming	in	Internet	of	Things	(IoT)
•	 Personal	identity	security
•	 Anti‑money	laundering	tracking	system
•	 Supply	chain	and	logistics	monitoring
•	 Voting	mechanism
•	 Advertising	insights
•	 Original	content	creation
•	 Cryptocurrency	exchange
•	 The	real	estate	processing	platform
•	 Health	care	systems
•	 Digital	currency	conversion	
research	surveillance	over	the	novel	AI	systems	is	unattainable.	
Hence,	we	have	proposed	the	permissioned	blockchain‑enabled	
platform	to	assist	the	AI	algorithms.
The	advantages	of	this	technology	are	multifolds	and	are	
as	follows:
•	 Designs	 a	 software	 architecture	 for	 decentralized	
data	 storage	 for	what	 concerns	 the	 administration	 of	
data	(validity,	privacy,	access	control,	and	incentivization	
to	participation)
•	 Implements	an	advanced	prototype	for	medical	data	sharing	
technology	readiness	level	(TRL)
•	 Creates	distributed	datasets	and	priorities	medical	use	cases	
for	important	social	and	scientific	impacts
•	 Creates	 tools	 and	 platforms	 for	 the	 emergence	 of	 a	
community	of	 students,	 entrepreneurs	 and	managers	of	
small	and	medium‑sized	enterprises,	academic	researchers	
in	different	fields,	and	other	experts	aimed	at	recognizing	
the	 importance	of	distributed	ownership	 and	 control	 of	
data	 and	getting	 acquainted	with	 the	use	of	 blockchain	
technology.
Blockchain Technology - Relevance in 
Developing Countries
Blockchain	technology	is	an	evolving	area,	and	its	acceptance	
in	healthcare	is	completely	dependent	on	the	availability	of	
quality	information	of	both	operational	and	clinical	data.	In	
developing	countries	like	India,	there	is	only	a	minor	percentage

Blockchain	technologies	are	inevitable	in	the	near	future	and	
their	incorporation	in	the	field	of	ophthalmic	AI	for	big	data	
management	in	developing	countries	is	only	a	matter	of	time.	
It	is	very	important	that	ophthalmologists	must	be	aware	of	
this	fact	and	equip	themselves	with	this	technology.
Challenges of Blockchain Technology
•	 Selecting	 the	 appropriate	blockchain	platform	 is	 crucial.	
Permissioned	blockchain‑enabled	platforms	[Fig.	1]	(based	
on	Hyperledger	 Fabric)	 should	 be	 given	 priority	 over	
permissionless	 blockchains	 [Fig.	 2].	 Users	 should	 be	
cognizant	of	the	workflow	changes	required	if	blockchain	
is	adopted.
•	 Mindsets	 deeply	 rooted	 in	 the	 traditional	 distributed	
database	management	 system	 (DDBMS)	 need	 to	 be	
changed.
•	 There	are	 significant	 costs	 involved	 in	 the	 investment	 in	
blockchain	technology.
•	 Immutability	 of	 the	 blockchain	 platform	will	 prevent	
amendments	of	erroneous	entries.
•	 Cryptographic	flaws	could	leave	vulnerabilities	within	the	
blockchain	platform.
•	 Decentralized	peer‑to‑peer	transactions	may	compromise	
patients’	 data	 if	 it	 has	 not	 been	 anonymized.	 The	
blockchain	 algorithms	need	 to	undergo	 extensive	 trials	
and	penetration	tests	to	guarantee	that	the	patient’s	privacy	
and	confidentiality	are	upheld.
Conclusion
Blockchain‑based	solutions	for	the	management	of	AI	research	
datasets and model testing offer the advantages of data 
integrity,	data	immutability,	automation	in	data	consistency,	
shared	ledger	promoting	easier	collaboration,	and	increased	
validation	and	transparency.	It	will	also	allow	health	regulators	
such	as	the	US	Food	and	Drug	Administration	to	effectively	
audit	and	verify	the	diagnostic	performance	of	AI	algorithms	
for	 approval.	 In	 addition,	 an	 ideal	digital	 infrastructure	 is	
provided	by	blockchain	technology	to	track	each	iteration	of	the	
AI‑model	training,	thus	improving	collaborative	efficiency	and	
trust.	Despite	various	advantages,	there	are	certain	important	
pitfalls	 of	 blockchain,	 such	 as	 the	democratization	of	data	
sharing,	which	should	be	acknowledged.	Democratization	of	
data	at	the	patient	level	might	not	materialize	due	to	privacy	
preservation,	thus	failing	to	convince	and	motivate	patients	to	
proactively	share	their	data.	It	may	be	more	realistic	to	consider	
the	monetization	of	big	data	at	an	institutional	level.	However,	
even	that	strategy	faces	significant	resistance	for	fear	of	privacy	
breaches	or	the	loss	of	autonomy	over	valuable	data.
