Abstract—We initiate the study of vote delegation in a costly
voting setting and compare its performance to conventional
voting. Our central insight is that if the number of malicious
voters is comparatively low, delegation dominates conventional
voting. If the number of malicious voters is moderate, then
conventional voting tends to be better than vote delegation. If
the number of malicious voters is high, both voting methods fail
to deliver a positive outcome.

I. INTRODUCTION
One of the reasons why voters do not vote is that voting
entails a cost, e.g., time to acquire information and to vote.
Rational voting is a topic of the following papers [5], [7].
Vote delegation in the network and its dangers is studied
in [2], [4]. Vote delegation can be seen as a part of blockchain
governance, [3].
In this communication, we study intertemporal and temporal
vote delegation when a minority of malicious voters attempt
to disrupt the functioning of an ecosystem (e.g., a blockchain
community, or a committee). First, we briefly discuss intertem-
poral vote delegation. In this setting, any pair of voters (vi, vj)
can write a contract about a vote exchange. A voter vi gives a
vote to a voter vj in round r in exchange for a vote in round w.
So much freedom regarding vote delegation can introduce an
attack, even with a single malicious voter. A malicious voter
can choose a voting round t in the future. If t is larger than
the half of all voters, the malicious voter can engineer the
vote exchange contracts with the majority of the other voters
such that at voting round t, she has the majority of votes,
and therefore, compromises the whole system. This simple
yet efficient attack called ”t-period attack” shows that a free
intertemporal vote exchange can be very dangerous, and that
some restrictions on the vote delegation and contracting should
be imposed.
Next, in the main part, we consider vote delegation in the
same voting round.
II. PRELIMINARIES
We consider a collective decision problem in which voters
decide between two alternatives, A and B. One of them is
correct, and the other one is wrong. Honest voters want the
correct alternative to be implemented, while malicious voters
prefer the opposite. We assume that honest voters obtain utility

1 if the correct alternative is implemented and utility 0 if the
wrong alternative is implemented. Informational assumption:
voters do not know the type of other voters, i.e., whether other
voters are honest or malicious. The collective decision problem
has the following elements:
• N : total number of honest voters is distributed as a
Poisson random variable with parameter n. Hence, n is
the expected number of honest voters.
• f : a finite number of malicious voters.
• c: cost of voting for every honest voter. We assume that
c includes the cost of finding the correct alternative.
• Malicious voters always vote (or equivalently, they are
not deterred from voting by costs).
A. Delegation
In this section, we consider a game in which the strategy
set of each voter consists of voting and delegation. Since the
identities of the malicious voters are not known, we assume
that delegation is done uniformly at random. Let γ denote
the delegation probability. From the decomposition property
of the Poisson random variable, see [6], we have that K,
the number of honest voters delegating, is distributed as a
Poisson random variable with parameter nγ. On the other
hand, S, the number of honest voters voting, is distributed as
a Poisson random variable with parameter n(1 − γ). Hence,
K votes are delegated to a group of S+f voters consisting of
the remaining S honest voters and f malicious voters. Let h
denote the number of votes that the honest voters obtain. Then,
h ∼ Binomial(K, S+1
S+1+f ). The malicious voters receive the
remaining K − h votes. The following figure illustrates this.
K
S f
h K − h
The function g denotes the gain for honest voters if
they receive x votes, and malicious voters receive y votes.
g(x, y) := 1, if x > y, 1
2 , if x = y and 0 if x < y.
We next determine mixed strategy equilibrium values for γ
(γ ∈ (0, 1)) (and thus S and K). A value of γ represents an

equilibrium if honest voters are indifferent between delegation
and voting. Let us consider deviations from a potential equilib-
rium constellation by an honest voter. From the environmental
equivalence, [6], the honest voter group size is S + 1 if he
votes. In case of delegating, a voter either delegates to S
honest voters or to f malicious voters. Therefore, we have
the following equilibrium condition:

We obtain our first result.
Proposition 1: There is a threshold f(c) ∈ Θ( 1
c ), so that
there are mixed strategy equilibria in the delegation game for
f < f(c) and no mixed strategy equilibria for f > f(c). In
particular, for high enough values of f , everyone delegates,
and thus malicious voters win.
The result is illustrated in Figure 1. The x-axis represents
values of γ, and the y-axis displays expected utility gains from
voting, with the straight blue line representing cost c.
B. Conventional Voting
In this section, we consider conventional voting in which
honest voters only decide between voting and abstention.
Let α be the probability of voting. We obtain the following
indifference condition between voting and abstaining:
2c =
(nα)f
enαf !
+
(nα)f−1
enα(f − 1)!
.
The probability of honest voters winning is given by:
q(n, f, α) =
∑∞
k=0
(nα)k
enαk! g(k, f).
We know from [1] that if f is larger than r 1
c2 for some
positive constant r, then the conventional voting game has
no mixed equilibria. The only equilibrium solution is that no
honest voter votes and malicious voters win. For low values of
f , we obtain a similar structural result as for vote delegation.
Proposition 2: There are mixed equilibria solutions to the
game with abstentions for sufficiently low f .
C. Comparison of Voting Rules
The following table displays the equilibrium probabilities of
honest voters wining for delegation and conventional voting.
f p1 p2 q1 q2

2 0.92 0.30 0.76 0.01
3 0.85 0.31 0.73 0.05

5 0.67 0.47 0.63 0.13

Numerical experiments support the pattern in Table I. They
suggest that two different equilibrium probabilities of honest
voters winning in the delegation game are higher than the
probabilities in the conventional voting game for sufficiently
low values of f . For moderate values of f , however, the
conventional voting game yields higher probabilities that the
correct alternative is chosen. Finally, for high values of f ,
malicious voters win with certainty in both delegation and
conventional voting games.
