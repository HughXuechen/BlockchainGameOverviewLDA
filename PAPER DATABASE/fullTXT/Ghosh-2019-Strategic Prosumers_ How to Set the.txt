Strategic Prosumers: How to Set the Prices
in a Tiered Market?
Arnob Ghosh , Vaneet Aggarwal , Senior Member, IEEE, and Hong Wan, Member, IEEE
Abstract—We consider users who may have renewable
energy harvesting devices or distributed generators. Such
users can behave as consumers or producers (hence, we
denote them as prosumers) at different time instances. We
consider a tiered market where the grid selects a price func-
tion, which reveals price in the real time based on the total
demand to the grid. In the real time, a prosumer can buy
from another prosumer in an exchange market knowing the
price from the grid. The exchange price is set by a platform
and can be different for different sellers. A prosumer is a
selfish entity, which selects the amount of energy it wants
to buy either from the grid or from other prosumers or the
amount of excess energy it wants to sell to other prosumers
by maximizing its own payoff. However, the strategy and the
payoff of a prosumer inherently depend on the strategy of
other prosumers as a prosumer can only buy if the other
prosumers are willing to sell. We formulate the problem as
a coupled constrained game and seek to obtain the gener-
alized Nash equilibrium. We show that the game is a con-
cave potential game and show that there exists a unique
generalized Nash equilibrium. We propose a distributed al-
gorithm that converges to the exchange price, which clears
the market and achieves the generalized Nash equilibrium.
We, finally, show how the grid should select the price func-
tion in a day-ahead scenario by computing the estimated
demand from the history. Our numerical result shows that
the tiered market can reduce the peak load and increase the
prosumers’ total payoffs.

I. INTRODUCTION
THE problems of the peak demand and the uncertainty of the
demand and supply are challenging the traditional power
grid. The integration of the renewable energy into the system
has increased the uncertainty because of the randomness of
renewable energy generation. The ever-increasing use of the
electric vehicles (EVs) has also increased the demand of the

users. A demand response mechanism has been proposed, where
time-of-use price is primarily used to shift the peak load during
the off-peak times. However, those approaches assume that the
users are price takers and do not consider the strategy of the other
users. In the real time, a consumer may consume a higher load
compared to the estimated value, which can lead to instability
in the grid. The total load can also be small, which should
influence the users to consume more to eliminate the instability
in the grid. Thus, a dynamic pricing mechanism is required,
which also incentivizes the users to reduce the demand in the
real time.
The continuing proliferation of the distributed energy re-
sources (e.g., photovoltaic arrays, solar rooftops, and energy
storage units) has transformed the notion of traditional users of
energy. The consumers can now also produce and reduce the
burden of the grid. If those producers share energy with the
consumers at a certain time in a geographical region, it would
enhance the renewable energy usage and also decrease the con-
ventional energy demand from the grid. Such a local exchange
is also useful as the transmission loss will be lower as compared
to the scenario where the grid has to serve the users. Thus, such
a kind of exchange between the prosumers (producers of dis-
tributed energy) and consumers has a lot of potential. However,
the prosumers have to be incentivized to participate in the ex-
change market. The design of the exchange market inherently
depends on the prices of the grid. If the prices for the conven-
tional energy are low, the exchange market may not be useful.
Higher price of the conventional energy may facilitate the ex-
change; it may increase the user’s cost in case it has to buy from
the grid. The higher electric prices will reduce the overall user’s
surplus.
Thus, a proper pricing mechanism is required, which will si-
multaneously increase the social welfare, facilitate the exchange
of energies among the prosumers, and decrease the demand of
the conventional energy from the grid. Note that the exchange
price has to be computationally simple because the exchange has
to be taken place in real time. The determination of an optimal
exchange price at a certain time is challenging. The exchange
between the prosumers will not depend on the price at a cer-
tain time but also on the exchange prices at other times. For
example, if the exchange price is high at peak time, users will
seldom opt for the exchange market during the peak time, which
does not serve the purpose of the exchange market. On the other
hand, if the exchange price is low, it may not incentivize the
prosumers to sell their exchange energy. The prices for the grid
have to be selected judiciously along with the prices for the

exchange market. The grid itself is unaware of the utilities of
the users and the excess energy the users possess a priori. We
seek to propose pricing mechanisms, which will simultaneously
maximize the social welfare, facilitate the exchange of energies
among the prosumers in an exchange market, and the grid’s cost
of procuring conventional energy.
We consider a tiered market structure, where, first, the grid
decides the price function, which is a price based on the real-
time demand (see Section III). Note that in the dynamic price,
the exact price is only revealed when the real-time demand is
realized. We assume that the price function is linear and is a
function of the total demand. Thus, the price (or the payment)
made by a consumer not only depends on its own demand, but
also on the demand of other consumers.
We consider a local exchange market, where the prosumers
can sell energies to other prosumers in an exchange market (see
Section III). Each prosumer may also have a renewable energy
harvesting device and a storage device. Given the exchange
price, the price function of the grid, and the renewable energy
prediction, each prosumer decides how much to buy from the
grid, how much to store, how much to sell (if any) to other
prosumers, and how much to buy from other prosumers at each
instance. The prosumers are selfish entities, which only want to
maximize their own payoffs. Each prosumer achieves a utility
for consuming a certain amount of load. Each prosumer’s payoff
depends on the utility it achieves, the profit it makes (if it sells
energy in the exchange market), or the cost it has to pay.
We consider that there exists a platform, which sets the ex-
change price. Examples of platform may be the load serving
entity, the aggregator, and a private retailer.1 The platform se-
lects different selling prices for different prosumers. Note that
different prosumers may have different amount of excess energy
to sell; thus, the platform selects different prices to incentivize
them to sell their energies. The platform selects not only prices
for the current time slot, but also prices for future time slots,
since the decision of the prosumers also depends on the future
time slots. The platform wants to maximize the overall utility of
the users. However, selecting a price that will maximize the sum
of the utilities of all the users is inherently challenging, since
the platform is unaware of the utilities of the users.
Since the prosumers are selfish entities, we use a game-
theoretic model to characterize the interaction among the pro-
sumers (see Section IV-A). Each prosumer selects its best re-
sponse by anticipating the behavior of others. However, the
strategy space is also dependent on the strategy of the other
prosumers. For example, the maximum energy bought by a pro-
sumer (A, say) from a prosumer (B, say) is limited by the
amount the prosumer B wants to sell at a certain time. Differ-
ent prosumers may not sell all the excess energy; rather, they
can store the energy and sell it only during the peak period.
Thus, finding an equilibrium strategy is inherently challenging.
We resort to the concept of the generalized Nash equilibrium
as the equilibrium concept, since the strategy space of a player
inherently depends on the strategies of others.
1Recently, there have been private retailers, which are providing exchange
service among the distributed generators [1].
We show that the game is a potential game (see Theorem 1).
In fact, the potential game is strictly concave when the utility
functions of the users are strictly concave and, thus, admits
a unique generalized Nash equilibrium. However, the above
equilibrium is not an optimal solution of the scenario, where the
sum of the prosumers’ utilities is maximized. In other words,
the equilibrium is not an efficient one; however, if the renewable
energy generation is high, the efficiency is also high.
Subsequently, we propose a distributed algorithm to find the
equilibrium (see Section IV-C) and the optimal price the plat-
form should set for the exchange of energy. In the algorithm,
the platform first sets a low price for each prosumer. Each pro-
sumer then decides the total load, the amount of energy to be
bought from other prosumers, and the amount of energy to be
sold. While taking its decision, a prosumer takes the strategy of
the previous iteration of other prosumers as an estimate of the
current strategy of the prosumers. Thus, a prosumer does not
need to know the utilities of other prosumers. The platform then
increases the exchange price by an ε amount for those prosumers
for which the supply is less than the demand. The process con-
tinues till the supply from all the prosumers matches the demand
of the consumers at each time slot.
We show that such a simple distributed algorithm converges
to the equilibrium strategy of the prosumers using the concept
of the fictitious play (see Theorem 2). The exchange price also
converges to the optimal price, which maximizes the overall
exchange of energy among the prosumers. The convergence is
also exponential.
Finally, we investigate the price function the grid has to select
for the price of the real-time demand. Too low price for the con-
ventional energy may enhance the user’s satisfaction (surplus);
however, it will not facilitate the exchange among the prosumers
and may not be enough for the grid to procure the conventional
energy. On the other hand, too high price may decrease the
user’s surplus. The grid should select prices, which have to be
profitable while maximizing the user’s surplus. We consider
such a scenario in Section V, where the grid maximizes the
expected total surpluses of the prosumers while maintaining a
fixed profit (β) to the generators. We, empirically, show that our
mechanism reduces the conventional energy consumption, de-
creases the price, and increases the renewable energy consump-
tion in Section VI. Our main contributions can be summarized as
follows.
1) We formulate a tiered market architecture, where, in the
first stage, the grid selects a linear price function depend-
ing on the total consumers’ demand. The price is realized
only when the total consumption of the prosumers is re-
vealed. In the second stage, the platform selects a price
for each seller in the exchange market. The proposed for-
mulation considers the tiered market operating on a time
horizon consisting of multiple time slots. Each seller and
buyer decide the amount of energy to sell and buy, re-
spectively, in the exchange market.
2) The prosumers are strategic; they only want to maximize
their own utilities. We show that there exists a unique
generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) in the prosumers’
strategy profile if the utility functions are concave.

3) We show that there exists a readily implementable price
mechanism for the platform, which achieves the unique
GNE in an iterative process.
4) We determine the optimal price function the grid should
select in order to maximize the prosumer’s profit while
maintaining a fixed profit of the grid.
II. RELATED LITERATURE
Demand response pricing has already been studied [2]–[8].
The analysis of all these papers is based on the assumption that
consumers are price takers. They find the optimal price based
on the estimated demand profile of the consumers. However, in
real time, the consumers may consume more as compared to the
estimate. The consumers will still pay a marginal price according
to the demand, which has been estimated a priori. We consider
a real-time pricing mechanism, where the price is set based on
the real-time total demand. Thus, the users (prosumers) have to
strategize their demand based on the anticipation of the strategy
of the other users. The above papers also did not consider the
scenario, where the users can sell energies among themselves in
a separate market setting.
Real-time pricing has been considered recently [9]–[13].
Eksin et al. [14] proposed a game-theoretic model, where the
consumers face a price, which varies depending on the total
load to the grid. However, the above papers did not consider the
exchange market, which is considered in our work. The game is
now a coupled constrained game, where the constraints of each
user (prosumer) also depend on the other prosumers’ decisions,
since a consumer can only know the amount a prosumer wants
to share. Thus, an optimal exchange price is required, which will
enhance the exchange of energy among the prosumers. Finally,
Eksin et al. [14] did not consider the temporal correlation of the
demand of the users. The utility of the users and the demand of
the users often have temporal correlation. For example, in the
EV charging, the users may need a certain amount of charged
battery before a certain deadline. The consumption of conven-
tional energy, and thus the exchange of energy, will also depend
on the prices across a certain horizon. Finally, each prosumer
may also have a storage device and, thus, may defer the selling
of energy at a later time if the selling price is higher.
Energy exchange among the users in a microgrid setting has
been considered [15]–[18]. The papers considered that the buy-
ers and sellers will exchange energy among each other by bid-
ding asking price and selling price, respectively. The authors
of [19]–[22] considered a microgrid scenario, where the pro-
sumers within the microgrid exchange energy. However, none
of the above-cited papers consider that the prosumers may have
a storage unit. Thus, a prosumer may strategically delay sell-
ing energy if it gets a favorable price in the future by storing
energy. Furthermore, the above-cited papers assumed that the
demand consists of nondeferrable loads. However, in practice,
users may defer the consumption of energy if it is better to
exchange energy when the exchange price is high. Thus, un-
like the above-cited papers, we consider temporal correlation
among the strategies of the prosumers. The above-cited papers
did not consider the price selection of the grid. We consider a
tiered architecture, where, at the first stage, the grid selects a
price function for the conventional energy. The price is realized
only when the amount of conventional energy is realized. We
optimize the price the grid should select in order to maximize
the utilities of the prosumers with a fixed profit margin.
III. SYSTEM MODEL AND PROSUMER’S PROBLEM
FORMULATION
In this section, we will describe the pricing behav-
ior (see Section III-A), prosumer’s utility functions (see
Section III-B), and the constraints every prosumer has to sat-
isfy (see Section III-C). Finally, we formulate the optimization
problem for the prosumer decision (see Section III-D).
A. Pricing Structure
We assume that the time is slotted. Each prosumer can act
either as a producer or a consumer in a slot. Prosumers also
decide how much to sell (producer) or buy (consumer) in the
exchange market. The prosumer wants to decide its demand over
a certain time horizon T (e.g., over a day or over a 8–9-h period).
Let the number of prosumers be N . Note that a prosumer does
not need to have energy generation capability; rather, it can be
a traditional consumer, which consumes energy.
Let li,t be the demand of prosumer i to the grid at during
time [t, t + 1). The price selected by the independent system
operator (ISO) for the consumption of conventional energy is
denoted as
pt
(∑
i
li,t
)
= γt
∑
i
li,t (1)
where li,t is the demand of prosumer i to the grid at time t.
Note that
∑
i li,t is the total load of the grid at time t. γt is the
parameter that is selected by the grid and depends on the time
of the day. Note that setting a price that varies linearly with the
total demand is quite common in the literature [14], [23]. In
Section V, we discuss how the grid should select γt .
Note that prosumer i can buy energy from the grid at time
t. Thus, the load li,t can be positive for those prosumers. The
prosumer may buy energy from the grid if it does not produce
enough energy, and the energy bought in the local exchange
market is not sufficient to meet its demand. Also, note that we
do not rule out the scenario, where the prosumer may sell energy
in the local exchange market; however, it may buy energy from
the grid. Our analysis shows that in our designed market, the
above-mentioned scenario does not arise.
The prosumer is different from the microgrid. The microgrid
consists of a cluster of loads and distributed generators. How-
ever, the prosumer is a term reserved for an individual user.
A cluster of prosumers can constitute a microgrid if it can act
independently or in synchronization with the macrogrid.
Note that the price of the grid not only depends on the load of
the user i, but also on the loads of the other prosumers. The price
is realized only when the load of all the prosumers is known.
Thus, it leads to a game among the users, where the payoff
inherently depends on the strategies chosen by the other users.
A user is not aware of the exact demand of the other users; thus,
it leads to an incomplete information game. Note that unlike the
price that is independent of the total load, in the price strategy

stated in (1), there will always be an upper limit of the load. This
is because a user will try to resist consuming too much energy.
The price is the same to all buyers at any given time t. Fig. 1
depicts the tiered market structure we envision.
Exchange price: At time t, we assume that there is a platform,
which sets the prices for exchange among the prosumers. Each
prosumer decides how much energy to be sold not only at time
t, but also for entire time horizon T . The consumer also selects
the amount of energy it wants to consume. If prosumer i buys
energy from prosumer j, it pays an amount μj,t per unit of energy
during time [t, t + 1). Thus, the selling prices may be different
for different prosumers. However, the buyers pay the same per
unit price to each seller. The platform wants to maximize the
overall utilities of the users by selecting an optimal price. Fig. 1
depicts that prosumer 1 gets energy from prosumer n at price
μn,t during time slot t.
B. Prosumer’s Payoff
We, now, compute the expression of each prosumer’s payoff.
Let prosumer i buy a qi,j,t amount of energy from prosumer j
during [t, t + 1). Let prosumer i sell an si,t amount of energy
during the time duration. Let the prosumer i’s demand (or total
consumption) during time duration [t, t + 1) be di,t . The user’s
utility Ui,t only depends on the consumption di,t . Note that the
utility function is time dependent, as the values of the parameters
of the function may change over time.
Let the prosumer i’s demand (or total consumption) during
time duration [t, t + 1) be di,t . Thus, the user i’s profit or total
payoff is

⎤
⎦ .
(2)
The user’s2 payoff inherently depends on the decision of the
other users. Note that the amount of energy a consumer buys
from the other producers in the exchange market also inherently
depends on the amount of energy sold by the other producers.
Assumption 1: We assume that Ui,t(·) is concave and
continuous.
2In the following, we use the notation user and prosumer interchangeably.
User’s preference (or comfort) increases with the consump-
tion. However, the rate of increase of preference decreases with
the demand di,t . The utility function is randomly drawn from a
distribution. The ISO or the other prosumers are unaware of the
exact utility of a prosumer. However, there may be a correlation
among the prosumers.
The utility may also have a temporal correlation. For exam-
ple, a prosumer can only attain a utility if the total demand is
satisfied within a deadline. The prosumer will have zero utility
if the demand is unsatisfied within the deadline. Such a kind of
utility arises for the deferrable loads such as EV charging and
dishwasher.
C. Problem Formulation: Constraints
In this subsection, we describe the system of constraints that
each prosumer has to satisfy while taking its own decision.
Some users may have a deferrable load. The demand only
needs to be fulfilled within a certain time. For example, the
EV needs to be ready before 8 A.M. (e.g., if the user is going
to work). However, the individual load may vary over time.
We denote the set of deferrable appliances as Ai . Suppose that
the load assigned to appliance j of user i is xi,j,t for the time
duration [t, t + 1). Hence, we have
Tj∑
t=1
xi,j,t ≥ Xj∀i,∀j ∈ Ai (3)
where Xj is the amount of load required for appliance j.
Let the set of nondeferrable load of prosumer i beBi . Let xi,j,t
be the load for appliance j ∈ Bi . The user’s total consumption
during time [t, t + 1) is thus
di,t =
∑
j∈Ai ∪Bi
xi,j,t . (4)
The demand of prosumer i has to exceed the demand for non-
deferrable appliances at each instance. Thus, we have
di,t,max ≥ di,t ≥ di,t,min (5)
where di,t,max and di,t,min are known beforehand.
Let the amount of energy sold by prosumer j be sj,t during
time slot t. Let the energy bought by prosumer i from prosumer
j is denoted as qi,j,t during time [t, t + 1). Thus, we have
qi,t =
∑
j
qi,j,t . (6)
The energy bought from user j must be smaller than the total
energy sold by user j. Also note that the sum of energies bought
by all the prosumers has to be equal to the energy sold by
prosumer j. Thus, we have∑
i
qi,j,t = sj,t∀j. (7)
Each prosumer has a renewable energy harvesting device,
which harvests Ēi,t amount of energy3 during time [t, t + 1).
3A prosumer may not have any renewable energy harvesting device. In that
case, the renewable energy will be 0.

GHOSH et al.: STRATEGIC PROSUMERS: HOW TO SET THE PRICES IN A TIERED MARKET? 4473
Prosumer i may also have a battery with capacity Bi,max . If the
prosumer does not have any battery, then Bi,max is 0. The state
of the battery is Bi,t . The amount of energy discharged from
the battery is ei,t , and that charged to the battery is bi,t . Thus,
we have
Bt+1 = Bt + Ēi,t − ei,t + bi,t . (8)
Note that the renewable energy generation is a random process.
Hence, a prosumer will only have the estimate of Ēi,t , rather
than the exact realized value.
The state of the battery cannot be less than 0. The state of
the battery is also required to be a specific value at the end of
the horizon. Most often, the state of the battery is kept to be the
same as the start of the day. Thus, we have
BT +1 = B1, 0 ≤ Bt ≤ Bmax . (9)
Note that the energy bought from the grid as well as from
the other prosumers also has a transmission loss. Let ri,j ≤ 1
be the transmission efficiency between the users i and j, and
ri be the transmission efficiency between user i and the grid.
Thus, the total consumption of prosumer i during time [t, t + 1)
is given by
di,t =
∑
j
qi,j,tri,j − si,t + li,tri − bi,tηd + ei,tηc (10)
where ηd ≤ 1 and ηc ≤ 1 are the discharging and charging ef-
ficiency from the battery, respectively. Note that only a portion
of energy bought by the prosumer can be used because of the
transmission loss.
Now, we assume the following.
Assumption 2: ri,j > ri for all i and j.
We consider a geographically colocated prosumers. The ex-
tension of our work for prosumers situated in a vast geographical
area is left for the future. Generally, the transmission efficiency
from a neighbor prosumer should be high compared to obtaining
energy from the grid. This is because the grid often times obtain
energy from a far greater distance than the distance between
local neighbors.
D. Formulated Problem
We are now ready to specify the optimization problem that
each prosumer solves for every time horizon [t, t + T ) as
Pi : maximize
T∑
t=1

μi,tsi,t −

j �=i

]
subject to (3)–(10)
var di,t , li,t , qi,t , si,t , ei,t ,
bi,t , qi,j,t , si,j,t ≥ 0. (11)
The problem is convex when the prosumer knows others’ strate-
gies. However, a prosumer is unaware of the strategies set by
other prosumers.
Note that we must have qi,tsi,t = 0, since a prosumer cannot
buy and sell simultaneously. Later, we show that in an optimal
solution, we indeed have qi,tsi,t = 0.
Here, Ui,t(·) is assumed to be separable across the demand
for each time period t. Our analysis can also be applied to the
scenario, where Ui,t(·) is not separable across time. Also note
that each prosumer optimizes over the time slots t = 1, . . . , T .
It is extended to the scenario for any time horizon starting from
t = τ rather from t = 1.
Also note that the exchange market is local. We did not con-
sider the ac reactive power constraint and the network effect due
to the Kirchoff’s laws.
E. Platform’s Objective
The platform wants to maximize the total payoff of the pro-
sumers. Thus, the objective of the platform is the following:
maximize
T∑
t=1

μi,tsi,t −

)
+ Ui,t (di,t)
subject to (3)–(10)
var : μj,t ≥ 0 ∀j. (12)
Note from the constraint in (7) that
∑
j qj,i,t = si,t and qi,i,t =
0. Hence, we have∑

Thus, the optimization problem the platform solves is the fol-
lowing:

∑

subject to (3)–(10)
var : μj,t ≥ 0 ∀j. (14)
Note that though μj,t does not appear in the objective value,
μj,t controls the amount of energy to be exchanged among the
prosumers as prosumer i maximizes Pi . Thus, |muj,t inherently
depends on the decisions of the prosumers. However, the plat-

parameters such as the renewable energy generation and the bat-
tery capacity of the prosumers. In Section IV-C, we show how
the prosumers should select the prices, which will optimize the
above problem.

IV. SOLUTION METHODOLOGY
Each prosumer is a selfish entity. It is only entitled to maxi-
mize its own payoff. The prosumer’s payoff inherently depends
on the other prosumers’ strategies. We, thus, formulate the prob-
lem of prosumer’s decision as a game-theoretic model (see
Section IV-A). We show that the problem is coupled con-
strained game, since the constraints of the prosumers are cou-
pled. We seek to obtain the generalized Nash equilibrium. In
Section IV-B, we show that the game admits a concave potential
function, and thus, there exists a unique generalized Nash equi-
librium. Leveraging on the concave potential game, we propose
a distributed algorithm (see Section IV-C), where each prosumer
updates its strategy based on the decision taken by the other pro-
sumers in the previous period. However, the equilibrium is not
efficient as it does not solve the problem, where the objective is
to maximize the sum of the payoffs of the prosumers. We show
that as the renewable energy generation increases, the efficiency
increases.
A. Generalized Nash Equilibrium
We, first, start with a notation which we use throughout.
Definition 1: Let ai be the strategy of player i, and a−i be
the strategy vector of all players except player i.
The Nash equilibrium is generally to describe the equilibrium
strategy profile for strategic users. In the following, we define
the Nash equilibrium.
Definition 2 (see [24]): The strategy profile (ai, a−i) is a
Nash equilibrium strategy profile if the following holds:
E[ui(ai, a−i)] ≥ E[ui(a′
i , a−i ] for all i and a′
i ∈ Si , where Si
is the set of strategies of the player i.
Specifically, in a Nash equilibrium strategy profile, any
player cannot have higher payoff by deviating unilater-
ally from the prescribed strategy profile. We next intro-
duce a class of games known as a coupled constrained
game.
Definition 3: If the strategy space of a player depends on
the other players, the game is known as a coupled constrained
game. The generalized Nash equilibrium is the corresponding
equilibrium concept in the coupled constrained game.
Note that because of the constraints in (7), the strategy space
of a prosumer also depends on the strategy of other prosumers.
Hence, the our model belongs to the coupled constrained game.
A generalized Nash equilibrium is used as an equilibrium con-
cept for the coupled constrained game. We now define the gen-
eralized Nash equilibrium.
We denote the set of strategy of prosumer i as ai,t , where
ai,t = {di,t ,Qi,t , qi,t , si,t , ei,t , bi,t , li,t}. Qi,t consists of the
component qi,j,t (si,j,t , respectively) for all j.
Definition 4: Let Ai be the set of feasible solution of Pi .
A strategy profile a∗
t = (a1,t , . . . ,aN,t) is a generalized Nash
equilibrium if a∗
t ∈ Ai for all i, and a∗
t is a Nash equilibrium
strategy profile.
In many games, a Nash equilibrium may not exist. Even if
the Nash equilibrium exists, the question arises whether it is
unique. If it is unique, the question is whether it is practically
implementable. In the following section, we answer the above
questions in an affirmative sense by applying the theory of po-
tential game [25], [26].
B. Potential Game
We, now, show that the game defined in the previous sec-
tion, where user i maximizes Pi , is a potential game. First, we
introduce the definition of the potential game.
Definition 5: Suppose user i’s payoff function is ui(ai, a−i),
where ai is the strategy of user i, and a−i denotes strategies of
other users apart from user i. Then, a game is potential if and only
if there exists a function Φ such that ui(a′
i , a−i) − ui(ai, a−i) =
Φ(a′
i , a−i) − Φ(ai, a−i), ∀i [25].
If Φ(·) is concave (strictly), then the game is (strictly) concave
potential game [25].
In the following, we show that the game we introduced is a
potential game.
Theorem 1: The game is potential. If Ui(·) is strictly concave
∀i, then it is a strictly concave potential game, and thus, it has a
unique pure generalized Nash equilibrium.
Proof: Let us assume that ui(ai, a−i) =
∑T
t=1 μi,tsi,t +
Ui,t(di,t) −
∑
j �=i μj,tqi,j,t − li,tγt(
∑
i li,t), where ai is itself
a vector consisting of di,t , li,t , qi,t , si,t , et , bt . Now, consider the
following function:
Φ(ai, a−i)=

⎦ . (15)
Φ(·) is a potential function since
ui(a′, a−i) − ui(ai, a−i) = Φ(a′, a−i) − Φ(ai, a−i). (16)
Φ(·) is concave since Ui,t(·) is concave.
Since the potential function is strictly concave, there exists
a unique solution. Hence, the generalized Nash equilibrium is
unique. �
Thus, the equilibrium of the game is given by the optimal
solution of the potential function subject to the constraints.
We, now, state the optimization problem, the solution of
which will give the generalized Nash equilibrium:

Intuitively, the payment made by a buyer is received by a seller.
Thus, the total payoffs of the prosumers were devoid of the
total exchange payment made in the exchange market. Since the
potential game is concave, the solution of the problem can be
obtained using the convex optimization tool.
C. Distributed Solution
Though Ppotential is a convex optimization problem, one
needs to know each prosumer’s utility and constraints. Thus,
a centralized solution is difficult to obtain in practice. In this
section, we show that how a distributed algorithm converges to
the generalized Nash equilibrium.
Each user updates its strategy for a certain time horizon T ,
which we denote as epoch. At epoch k, the prosumer decides
for the time slots kT + 1, . . . , (k + 1)T . The platform initially
selects exchange prices μj,t for each prosumer j. The prosumer
then updates its strategy profile for each time slot in the epoch.
The platform then again updates the price until the process con-
verge. The algorithm ALGO-DIST is detailed in the following
ALGO-DIST:
1) Initialization: For each prosumer i, the price is set at μ1
i,t
at a some minimum possible value.
2) At iteration k ≥ 1, each prosumer i = 1, . . . , N updates
its strategy by obtaining ak
i,t = (lki,t , dk

3) If si,t <

i,t = μk
i,t + ε; if si,t ≥∑
j �=i qj,i,t , set μk+1
i,t = μk
i,t , and go to step 2.
4) If si,t ≥
∑
j �=i qj,i,t for all i, then exit.
5) The user i pays lki,tγt
∑
j lkj,t at time t to the grid and
obtains the value of other users’ load.
Here, αk is the learning parameter, and it is set at 1/(k + 1).
The parameter puts a weight αk on the optimal decision of the
current stage. The above also ensures that the optimal decision
at the current iteration is not very far away from the decision of
the previous iteration.
Note that a prosumer does not have a constraint in (7), since
the user does not know the amount to be sold by other prosumers.
Rather, the exchange amount is set in a dynamic fashion, where
each prosumer updates the amount of energy it wants to buy or
sell depending on the price. The price converges to the value,
where the market is clear. This is because the price is reduced
till the point the supply is enough to satisfy the demand for each
prosumer in the exchange market. In other words, the constraint
in (7) is always satisfied in the converged solution.
The following shows that the above algorithm converges to
an equilibrium.
Theorem 2: The distributed algorithm ALGO-DIST termi-
nates after a finite number of iterations. The solution converges
to the optimal solution of the potential game for small enough
ε > 0.
The constraint in (7) is satisfied in the converged solution.
The proof of the above theorem readily follows from the
Jacobi algorithm [27]. Hence, we omit it here.
It is apparent that as ε becomes smaller, the algorithm con-
verges to the solution of the potential game. Specifically, the
algorithm converges to the generalized Nash equilibrium.
Note that in the algorithm, each prosumer only needs
to know the load of the other users during the time slots
(k − 1)T + 1, . . . , kT for deciding its own decision. The pro-
sumer can obtain the information from the blockchain, where
each prosumer updates its strategy. It does not need to know the
utility functions of the other users, their energy surplus, or even
the battery capacities. Thus, the algorithm is easy to implement,
and yet, it converges to the generalized Nash equilibrium.
The user uses the data over the last epoch to obtain its own
decision in the current epoch. Surprisingly, a simple algorithm
converges to an equilibrium strategy. The above type of strat-
egy, where a prosumer learns about the strategy of the other
prosumers, is known as fictitious play. Since the potential func-
tion is strictly concave, the convergence is exponential [28].
The platform updates the price for each prosumer depending
on the supply and demand for each prosumer. If the supply ex-
ceeds demand for a prosumer, it will decrease the corresponding
price. On the other hand, if the demand is higher than the supply,
it will increase the price.
Note that each prosumer knows the value of γt while up-
dating its decision. γt is set by the grid or the ISO on be-
half of the grid and changes in a longer time scale. Since
the estimate of the renewable energy generation changes in
real time, the prosumer can update its strategy at a minute
scale. The convergence is exponential; thus, the algorithm can
be adopted dynamically to obtain the prices. The initial price
can be set at the lowest possible price for the conventional
energy, which will ensure that the prosumers always try to buy
from the exchange market.
The exchange prices are dynamic and are different for each
prosumer. In the numerical section, we show that during the
peak time, the conventional energy price is likely to be more.

The prosumers will be more likely to sell energies during the
peak time. The above has threefold advantages. First, the pro-
sumers will earn more. Second, the peak conventional energy
demand will also reduce. Finally, the price for the conventional
energy will also go down.
We consider a posted price mechanism, which is inherently
truthful. The prices correspond to the Lagrangian of a convex
optimization problem. A prosumer only selects the amount of
energy to be sold or to be bought. Thus, a prosumer does not
have any market power unlike the scenario where the distributed
generators are bidding.
D. Efficiency of the Equilibrium
We, now, investigate the efficiency of the generalized Nash
equilibrium obtained in the last section. Our result shows that
the game is not efficient. Specifically, the equilibrium strategy
profile of the game is not optimal for maximizing the sum of the
profits of the users. In the following, we compute the efficiency
ratio.
Let
P : maximize
T∑
t=1
∑
i

(∑
i
li,t
)⎤
⎦
subject to (3)–(11)
var : si,t , qi,j,t , di,t , ei,t , bi,t ≥ 0. (20)
Since
∑
i li,tγt(
∑
i li,t) = γt(
∑
i li,t)2, and using (13), P can
be equivalently represented as
P : maximize
T∑

⎣∑

i
li,t
)2
⎤
⎦
subject to (3)–(11)
var : si,t , qi,j,t , di,t , ei,t , bi,t ≥ 0. (21)
Note that the objective function of P denotes the sum of the
payoffs of the prosumers. Thus, the optimal solution of P max-
imizes the sum of the prosumer’s payoffs. Thus, P is the same
as the platform’s objective.
Let ai,t = (li,t , si,t , qi,t , bi,t , ei,t , di,t) be the decision vector
for each user i at time t. The problem P is a convex optimization
problem as the objective function is concave, and the constraints
are linear.
We, next, introduce some notations.
Definition 6: Let a∗
i,t be the optimal solution of the problem
P . Let aeq
i,t be the equilibrium strategy profile. Specifically, it is
the optimal solution of Ppotential [cf., (19)].
Now, we are ready to characterize the efficiency ratio of the
equilibrium strategy profile.
Definition 7: Let the objective value attained by the strategy
profile aeq
i,t in the problem P be Peq , and let P ∗ be the optimal
value of P [cf., (21)]. Then, the efficiency is
η =
Peq
P ∗ . (22)
Note that since each prosumer selfishly optimizes its own
payoff, the generalized Nash equilibrium does not necessarily
maximize the sum of the payoffs of the prosumers. The effi-
ciency is always less than or equal to 1 since aeq
i,t may not be
equal to the optimal solution of P . Note that in the equilibrium
strategy profile, the user consumes larger energy as compared
to the optimal solution from the grid because of the additional
term.
Proposition 1: The efficiency η increases as the amount of
renewable energy increases.
The above proposition shows that the efficiency increases
when the renewable energy supply increases. Thus, as the re-
newable energy penetration increases, the equilibrium becomes
closer to the optimal solution of the sum of the prosumers’ utility
maximization problem.
If the load to the grid increases, the efficiency decreases.
However, the efficiency is never 0. It is always upper bounded
above 0. However, as the number of user increases, the efficiency
decreases.
V. GRID’S OBJECTIVE
In this section, we now consider how the grid should select γt .
We consider that the grid incurs a cost Ct(·) for the conventional
energy during time slot t. In general, the generators or conven-
tional energy providers bid the selling price as a piecewise linear
function. We assume that Ct(·) is a convex function.
The grid would like to increase the user’s satisfaction. Thus,
the grid’s main objective is to maximize the total consumer’s
(or, prosumer’s surplus). Thus, from (13), the grid wants to
maximize
∑
t
∑
i
Ui,t (dI ,t) −
∑
t
γt
(∑
i
li,t
)2
. (23)
The grid also has to make sure that it pays the bidding price
to the generators if the grid obtains conventional energy from
the generator. The grid has to make sure that the system is at
least weakly budget balanced, i.e., the total revenue generated
from the users has to be greater than or equal to the payment
made to the grid. In practice, the grid has to provide incentives
to the conventional grid operators for the conventional energy.
Thus, we consider that a profit of β amount has to be provided
to the conventional energy providers for per unit of energy sold
by them. Hence, the grid needs to solve the following problem:
Pg maximize γt

The constraint in (24) ensures that the revenue generated from
the users must exceed the cost and the profit margin β

GHOSH et al.: STRATEGIC PROSUMERS: HOW TO SET THE PRICES IN A TIERED MARKET? 4477
Note that li,t , di,t inherently depend on γt as it specifies the
price one has to pay. Since Ui,t(·) is an increasing function,
the objective will be maximized when γt = 0. However, setting
γt = 0 will not satisfy the constraint unless li,t is 0. In the
following, we state the price strategy γt the grid should select
to optimize the problem in Pg .
Observation 1: Suppose γ∗
t = Ct (
∑
i li , t )+β
∑
i li , t
(
∑
i li , t )2 ; it is an
optimal solution of the problem in Pg .
Proof: Note that the user’s utility increases as the demand di,t
increases. di,t increases as γt decreases. Hence, the objective
is a decreasing function of γt . Thus, the price that optimizes
the objective is the minimum price that satisfied the constraint.
Hence, the result follows. �
Note that the grid selects γt before the exchange of energy
among the prosumers occur. Hence, the grid does not know
the exact amount of exchange, which will take place before
selecting γt . Thus, the grid is also unaware of the total load li,t
a priori.
Thus, we consider the following problem where the grid op-
timizes the expected value of the objective value:
Pg : maximize γt
∑

⎦ . (25)
The expectation is taken over the distribution of
∑
i li,t , which
is a random entity because of the uncertainty of the demand, and
the renewable energy. However, the grid may be able to predict
the demand from the historical data.
Since Ct(·) is convex, thus, note from Jensen’s inequality that
E

⎦ (27)
a solution of Pg is a feasible solution of Pexp . Thus, the opti-
mal value of Pexp provides an upper bound of Pg . Computing
Ct(E[
∑
i li,t ]) is much easier compared to E[Ct(
∑
i li,t)], since
we do not have to consider expectation over the parameter val-
ues. We compute Ct(E[
∑
i li,t ]) by knowing the expected total
load. Hence, we focus on solving Pexp .
Similar to Observation 1, the optimal γt the grid has to select
is the following.
Observation 2: Suppose γ∗
t = Ct (E [
∑
i li , t ])+βE [
∑
i li , t ]
E [
∑
i l2
i , t ]
; it is
an optimal solution of the problem in Pexp [cf., (27)].
Remark 1: Note that if Ct(x) = αtx
2 for some αt > 0, from
Observation 2, γt = αt + βE [
∑
i li , t ]
E [
∑
i l2
i , t ]
. If variance is small, γt is
small when the expected value of the total load is large. Thus,
γt should be small when the total load is large (peak time).
However, the price for the conventional energy can still be high.
Since the price pt for the conventional energy is γtE[
∑
i li,t ],
the price for the peak period may still be high even though γt is
small. In fact, if variance is small, the price for the peak period
will always be high.
VI. NUMERICAL ANALYSIS
In this section, we show the equilibrium load profile, the
reduction of the conventional energy consumption, and the ef-
ficiency of the generalized Nash equilibrium in an example
setting.
A. Parameter Setup
The conventional energy generation incurs a cost to the grid.
We assume that the cost function C(·) is a piecewise quadratic
function
C(L) =
{
a1L
2 + c1, if L ≤ L1
a2L
2 + c2, else.
For the simulation, L1 is assumed to be 2 MW. a1 and c1 are
taken as 15$/MWh2 and 1$, respectively. a2 and c2 are taken
as 20$/MWh2 and 1$, respectively. The utility function of the
prosumers is defined in the following manner:
Ui,t(d) = αtd − ζd2 (28)
where αt is a time-dependent random parameter, which has
a Gaussian distribution of mean 0.3$/kW during the off-peak
period (for t ∈ [6, 9] and t ∈ [13, 15]) and has a Gaussian distri-
bution of mean 0.6$/kW during the peak period (for t ∈ [9, 12]
and t ∈ [16, 18]). αt has a variance of 30 cents for all t. ζ is
assumed to be 0.1 $/kWh2.
We assume that the renewable energy is one-sided normally
distributed with a mean of 2 kW and a variance of 1 kW2 [29],
[30]. We assume that the battery capacity is assumed to be
10 kWh. We use the algorithm ALGO-DIST with ε = 10−6 to
obtain the solution for our approach.
The transmission loss is assumed to be symmetric and equal
for each prosumer. Specifically, ri,j = 0.9 for all i and j. The
transmission loss between the grid and prosumers is also as-
sumed to be the same with ri = 0.8 for all i. The exchange
market operates every 15 min. The time horizon T is set at 24 h.
Setting γt: We run the simulation for 14 consecutive days
or 336 h. Since T is 24 h, thus γt is changed after each 24 h.
We, now, describe how γt is set at the beginning of each day.
γt is set according to Observation 2, where the expected value
of load li,t is taken to be the average of all the total load during
time t at the previous days. For example, the expected value
of li,t for day 8 is considered to be the mean value of li,t for

is assumed to be 20 kWh for the peak period (for t ∈ [9, 12] and
t ∈ [16, 18]) and li,t is assumed to be 10 kWh for the off-peak
period.
B. Results
1) Efficiency With the Number of Prosumers: Our first re-
sult (see Fig. 2) shows the efficiency of the equilibrium strategy
profile with the number of prosumers. As the number of pro-
sumers increases, the efficiency decreases; however, the decre-
ment slows down when the number of prosumers exceeds a
certain threshold.
Fig. 2 also shows that if the renewable energy generation is
zero, the efficiency is much less. Note that Proposition 1 states
that if the renewable energy generation is small, the efficiency
decreases. Fig. 2 shows that the empirical findings are in accor-
dance with the theoretical results.
2) Impact of Exchange Market on the Peak Load: Fig. 3
shows that the exchange market reduces the peak demand by at
least 40%. When there is no exchange market, we assume that
the prosumers solve the problem, with μi,t being set at a high
value for all i and t in the optimization problem Pexp [cf., (27)].
Thus, the prosumers can only sell excess energies to the grid or
use it at later time by storing in their batteries. However, even
the prosumers have the storage device, the exchange market can
greatly enhance the reduction of the peak load. This is because
the prosumers can sell energies to the other prosumers in the
peak time, which reduces the peak load. The exchange prices are
also high during the peak time, as the demand to the prosumers
increases during the peak time.
Fig. 3 also shows that if the renewable energy generation
is zero, the demand of the conventional energy is higher. In-
tuitively, if the renewable energy is zero, all the prosumers are
consumers; hence, the demand for conventional energy is higher.
Fig. 4. Variation of social welfare when there is an exchange market
and when there is no exchange market with the battery capacity.
3) Increase of User’s Surplus: The total user’s surplus is
represented in the objective of the problemPexp [cf., (27)]. Fig. 4
shows the variation user’s surplus importance of the exchange
market as compared to the one where there is no exchange
market. Fig. 4 shows that the user’s surplus is at least 25%
higher when there is no exchange market. We assume that when
there is no exchange market, the prosumers optimize, with μi,t
being set at a high value in the optimization problem Pexp
[cf., (27)], which precludes any exchange among the prosumers.
The reduction of the user’s surplus is because of two factors.
First, the transmission efficiency is poorer between the grid
and the prosumers. Second, the price paid by the prosumers is
much higher when there is no exchange market. As the storage
capacity increases, the difference is more significant. However,
when the storage capacity increases beyond a certain threshold,
the difference decreases. This is because for higher storage, the
prosumers become self-sufficient.
Fig. 4 shows that if the renewable energy generation is zero,
the user’s surplus is smaller than both scenarios where there
is exchange market and no exchange market if the capacity of
storage unit is small. Since each user has to buy all the energy
from the grid if the renewable energy generation is zero, hence,
the user’s surplus decreases. However, if the capacity increases,
when the renewable energy generation is zero, since the users
may buy energy at the off-peak period and utilize it or exchange
among each other when Bmax increases. When the Bmax is very
large, the user’s surplus becomes higher compared to the sce-
nario where there is no exchange market. This is because when
the storage is high, a user may store excess energy during the
off-peak period and sell it to the other users in the exchange
market. Thus, a user is now able to attain a higher profit. Hence,
the user’s surplus becomes higher than the scenario where there
is no exchange market. The above shows that even if the re-
newable energy generation is small, the exchange market may
increase the user’s surplus if the capacities of the storage units
at the users’ premises are high.
4) Prices of the Grid: We now state the variation of prices
over t during a day. Note that the meant price pt = γtE[
∑
i li,t ],
where E[
∑
i li,t ] is the estimated total load. Fig. 5 shows the
variation of price per kilowatthour. Note that though the peak
period prices are high in the exchange market, the ratio of the
peak period and the off-peak period is only around 1.4. However,
the ratio of the peak period and off-period prices is almost 2
(similar to the current practice in Pacific Gas & Electricity) for
the market where there is no exchange. Fig. 5 shows that the

prices are reduced in our proposed tiered market compared to
the scenario where there is no exchange.
Fig. 5 shows that if there is no renewable energy, the prices are
higher, since the users now have to obtain energy from the grid.
VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We consider a system of prosumers that can share their excess
energies among themselves in addition to buying conventional
energy from the market. We consider a linear dynamic price
function for the conventional energy, where the price for the
conventional energy depends on the total demand for the con-
ventional energy. The optimal strategy of a prosumer depends on
the strategies of other prosumers. We, thus, model the strategy
selection problem of a prosumer as a game-theoretic problem.
The strategy space of a prosumer inherently depends on the
strategy of other prosumers, since the amount of energy a pro-
sumer can buy inherently depends on the amount of energy other
prosumers want to sell. We, thus, resort to the generalized Nash
equilibrium as an equilibrium concept. We show that the game
admits a concave potential function. We propose a distributed
algorithm, where each prosumer only selects its own optima
strategy. The platform selects the exchange price for each pro-
sumer. A prosumer does not need to know the other prosumer’s
utilities. It only needs to know the strategy taken by a prosumer
in the previous iteration to find its own in the current iteration.
The platform updates the price depending on the supply and the
demand. We show that the distributed algorithm converges to
the unique generalized Nash equilibrium. We also integrate the
grid’s decision with the exchange market and compute how the
grid should select price, which will also maintain a fixed profit
to the conventional generators. We show that our approach re-
duces the total consumption of the conventional energy and the
peak load. The prosumers’ total social welfare also increase.
Note that when there are multiple locations, we need to con-
sider the Kirchoff’s laws and the reactance constraints. The
characterization of a GNE when the exchange market operates
over several locations is left for the future. We consider a real-
time price, which varies linearly with the total demand. The
characterization of the generalized Nash equilibrium for other
nonlinear function and its impact on the efficiency ratio also
constitutes an interesting research direction. The impact of the
uncertainty of the renewable energy on the equilibrium strategy
profile is also left for the future.
