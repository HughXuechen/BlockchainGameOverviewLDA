Abstract: The article explores how the quality of life within a deprived urban environment might be
improved through the ‘gamification’ of and interaction with, more-than-human elements within the
environment. It argues that such quality may be achieved through the community’s multicentered
value from the bottom up. This is shown through the case study of the Co-De|GT urban mobile
application that was developed in the Synergetic Landscapes unit through real-life research by
design experimental studio teaching. Complimentary experimentation took place during the Relating
Systems Thinking and Design 10 symposium in the Co-De|BP workshop, where experts were able
to be collocated for interactive real-time data gathering. This application addresses the need for
collective action towards more-than-human synergy across an urban ecosystem through gamification,
community collaboration and DIY culture. It intends to generate a sustainable, scalable token
economy where humans and non-humans play equal roles, earning, trading and being paid for goods
and services to test such potentials for future economies underpinned by blockchain. This work
diverges from dominant economic models that do not recognise the performance of and the limits to,
material extraction from the ecosystem. The current economic model has led to the global financial
crisis (GFC). Furthermore, it is based on the unsustainable perpetual consumption of services and
goods, which may lead to the untangling and critical failure of the market system globally. Therefore,
this work investigates how gamification and tokenization may support a complementary and parallel
economic market that sustains and grows urban ecosystems. While the research does not speculate
on policy implications, it posits how such markets may ameliorate some of the brittleness apparent in
the global economic model. It demonstrates a systemic approach to urban ecosystem performance
for the future post-Anthropocene communities and economies.

1. Introduction
This article extends Co-De|GT Beta [1] that demonstrated work in progress on the
discussed mobile application presented at the Relating Systems Thinking and Design
10 Symposium [2] where it was also expanded during the Co-De|BP workshop [3]. This
article introduces the finalised prototype. Co-De|GT addresses several areas of the Euro-
pean Green Deal, such as Sustainable Industry, Building and Renovation, Farm to Fork,
Pollution Elimination, Biodiversity and Sustainable Finance [4]. From a broad perspec-
tive, this project refers to the New European Bauhaus that aims at beautiful, sustainable
and inclusive forms of living [5]. It also addresses several United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals, such as Zero Hunger [6], Good Health and Wellbeing [7], Industry,

Innovation and Infrastructure [8], Sustainable Cities and Communities [9], Responsible
Consumption and Production [10], Climate Action [11] and Life on Land [12]. Smart city
initiatives are often led by engineering, construction, consultancy and technology compa-
nies that influence the city’s decision making toward solutions that may be disconnected
from the specific needs, priorities and context of the city. This has sometimes led to a
greater concern for economic growth and technology innovation than for environmental
sustainability or social impacts and could create more harm to the environment and so-
ciety. However, innovation should also be directed to environmental sustainability and
inclusion [13]. The United Nations (UN) system is keen on leveraging new technologies to
optimise its daily operations and accelerate its work and efforts to achieve the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs). The benefits of increased computational power and advance-
ments in technologies such as blockchain, the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence
(AI), amongst others—whose roots were traditionally deep in the private sector—are now
being utilised more frequently in the humanitarian, development and public sectors for the
advancement of human welfare. To this end, the UN has provided a framework to leverage
new technologies as outlined in the Secretary General’s Strategy on New Technologies [14].
Blockchain technology as a foundational form of innovation is among the most trending
technologies attracting more interest for future urban development initiatives and smart
sustainable city efforts. The public sector and more specifically public service, are where
blockchain could have the most impact [13]. There is a current rise in discussions related to
the use of information and communications technology (ICT) when dealing with urban
ecosystems in sustainable smart cities [15]. This paper aims to address these challenges.
1.1. General Objectives
Spotswood et al. in their review point out that several species benefit more from urban
than other environments. Although some do not, this may be attributed to suboptimal adap-
tions necessary for their survival [16]. This situation needs to be reflected by architects and
urban designers that engage with the urban environment and its connectivity, habitats and
edible landscapes. However, such parameters are related to larger complex socio-technical
and economic systems. The recent independent review on the economics of biodiversity
ordered by the British Government written by Dasgupta points to the clear dependency
of the economy and ecosystems [17]. For example, we clearly cannot harvest vegetables
without plants and pollinators or wood building materials without trees and forests. This
needs to be reflected in our economic models that should integrate more-than-human
stakeholders, which is a phenomenon that has already begun to emerge in the 21st century.
A coffee machine can have a blockchain wallet and be programmed to make autonomous
decisions and purchases [18] or an object such as a river can obtain legal personhood and
be afforded the rights of a human being [19]. The two years of the annual Synergetic
Landscapes unit have related several dependencies within an urban complexity, such as
the human and non-human communities, circular economy, token economy, material tech-
niques, natural materials and biocorridors for edible and habitable landscape for all [20]
through gamification. At its initial stage, a discussion on how such edible and habitable
cross-species landscapes can be tokenised and provide agency within an economic system
using blockchain technology was started [21]. In its second year, these relations were
integrated into a Co-De|GT mobile application prototype for the Grangetown community
of Cardiff, Wales, UK. The work is integrated within a larger Grangetown-focused Com-
munity Gateway project [22] managed by Cardiff University. Today, the area is home to
generations of Welsh and Welsh Somali, Bangladeshi, African/Caribbean, Pakistani, Indian,
European, British and multi-ethnic Welsh-language communities, constituting Wales’ most
ethnically diverse electoral ward. Containing super-output areas ranked within the 10%
most deprived areas overall in the Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation, Grangetown ad-
dresses key challenges in the areas of poverty and health through well-established Church,
Mosque, Temple, public sector, third sector and voluntary networks [22–24]. However,
Grangetown is also laying on an important biocorridor connecting Bute Park and Cardiff
Sustainability 2022, 14, 3787 3 of 20
Bay through the river Taff. However, biodiversity is lower in Grangetown than in other
connecting locations due to urbanisation. Therefore, this project aims to work with the
Grangetown community to give the mentioned human and non-human stakeholders a
voice and to build a system of quality values from the bottom up through a gamified
mobile application that introduces a more-than-human economy. The hypothesis is that
such systemic intervention might improve the quality of life of both the human and the
non-human stakeholders.
1.2. Quality and Value
The search for a universal definition of quality has yielded inconsistent results. Such a
global definition does not exist; rather, different definitions of quality are appropriate under
different circumstances [25]. System Integrity, justice and quality of life are key dimensions
to sustainability [26]. Interestingly, most investigators proceed with their assessment tasks,
essentially ignoring the concerns of those who question whether quality-of-life can be
assessed. Yet, the degree of frustration in defining quality-of-life is palpable, even among
quality-of-life researchers. There seems to be no a priori criteria that can be used to decide
whether a particular operational definition is adequate on not. As a result, an operational
definition is initially a subjective statement whose creditability rests on being able to
replicate the operations and duplicate the initial findings [27]. The challenge is to safeguard
and reconcile requirements of environmental sustainability, technical functionality and
social quality, such as quality of life and the user-friendliness of buildings, especially
against the background of climate change, environmental crises and a growing world
population [28].
The built environment is particularly problematic regarding the quantification of
quality. In the first instance, many measures of ‘quality’ have been historically quantified
through male perceptions, Including things such as environmental comfort and safety [29].
Although this has been recognised for some time, it continues to be a problem. Research
shows that basing a building’s environmental requirements only on the male metabolic
rate may mean they could be ‘intrinsically non-energy-efficient in providing comfort to
females’ [30]. Thus, even within the human species, the idea of ‘quality’ is contested
and environments privilege certain stakeholders and disadvantage others. This bias is
even more pronounced when we consider how our environments disadvantage other-
than-human species. Increasingly, a lack of biodiversity is being recognised as potentially
catastrophic for humanity [31].
Extending this discussion, there is increasing evidence that access to a variety of
environments is good for the human species. For example, research shows that green areas
reduce the effects of urban heat islands [32,33]; and that access to both green and blue
spaces—spaces that have a view of the water—increase a feeling of wellbeing [34]. However,
the value of multi-species and more-than-human environments lacks the compelling well-
being ‘value’ that has been established with green and blue spaces. Even where the value
of green space is recognised, the relationship between it and the built environment is often
seen as a zero-sum game. In the economics of the modern neo-liberal city, green space is
preventing the full market monetisation of the city space.
It is with this problem in mind that our research attempts to speculate how green
spaces, what we might term as more-than-human infrastructure, might be included within
the value framework of the built environment instead of existing in opposition to it.
The application we discuss here is the first step in the gamification of this problem and
represents an attempt to find a solution. Specifically, our research explores how the concepts
of gamification might be used to create a trading ecology to include and thus increase,
the value and quantity of other-than-human spaces and infrastructure.
In Co-De|GT, we explore how the quality of life in urban environments can be ap-
preciated by the community from the bottom up by assigning values to different living
agents’ performances via eco-socio-technological systems for social and environmental
justice. Quality of life can be viewed as a subjective, multidimensional concept that places
Sustainability 2022, 14, 3787 4 of 20
emphasis on the self-perception of an individual’s current state [35]. Therefore, this research
applies a multi-centred perspective to it through gamification and tokenisation. Different
community actors can assign value through tokens to what they perceive as quality. As the
result integrates multiple perspectives, individual parameters are considered within this
holistic model of urban gaming.
In a similar way to quality, value is a subjectivist notion related to perceived needs
and preferences [36]. However, some findings have indicated that some people view their
values as explicit, stable and universally applicable guidelines in their life, while others
see them as contradictory, changing and highly subjective [37]. Both perspectives need
to be taken into consideration. Therefore, this model addresses ‘time-based design’ [38]
that constantly coevolves across multiple stakeholders (users) in real-time and real-life
environments, within the ‘real-life codesign laboratory’ [39,40]. This laboratory cocreates a
prototype of a new economic model of Post-Anthropocene where different kinds of living
beings have a wallet and can operate with it.
1.3. Gamification and Tokenisation
Climate change and biodiversity loss are closely related as one is causing the other [41,42].
There is an urgent need for effective ways to engage diverse audiences on global climate
change. The complexity of climate change overwhelms diverse and geographically dis-
connected individuals preventing them from creating a meaningful impact on the overall
health of the planet. Climate change is a complex challenge where a significant positive
change in the environment requires a collective and synergistic action towards improving
biodiversity at local levels.
In ‘Reality is Broken’ McGonigal demonstrates how gaming concepts can be success-
fully applied to complex global problems [43]. She unpacks the gaming concepts that
result in communities collaborating on complex multi-dimensional problems in multiple
time zones. Players devote more time per week to this type of collaborative gaming than
to their paid employment. The global reach of these platforms means communities can
engage in the game and challenges 24 h a day. McGonigal later uses these concepts to
design a game around the problem of globally depleting oil supplies. In the case study,
a community not only codesigns a series of challenges that the world will face, but they
also collaborate on solving these problems to achieve the goal of a better world without
oil. Climate change games may offer the tools necessary to address these challenges [44].
The use of smartphones for leisure activities has widened the game-playing population
spectrum while introducing new genres labelled as ‘social gaming’ (games with an em-
phasis on social interactions, usually with friends) and ‘casual gaming’ (games designed
to be played without needing special skills or strong player commitment, in contrast to
‘hardcore games’) [45].
Gamification is the use of game design elements in nongame contexts. Its goal is
to afford the motivating, enjoyable experiences characteristic of gameplay in nongaming
contexts. Challenge, motivation and enjoyment are critical to that. These are systemic,
emergent properties [46]. The research presented here broadens this discourse, applying the
concepts of gamification to the challenge of creating a more inclusive ‘more-than-human’
multi-species urban environment. It also advances McGonigal’s work by developing a
prototype technology application that will be necessary to scale adoption. Emulating online
digital gaming platforms, it speculates on a technology infrastructure that will be necessary
to enable a global community to address the challenges of the Anthropocene.
Co-De|GT is a hybrid model, combining ‘puppet master/player’ and personas and
direct user interaction. Puppet masters are described by McGonigal as modes when
game designers send exact tasks to the player without decisive options [47]. To join
Co-De|GT, the new player must perform the DIY recipe and by doing that they gain
tokens. However, there are always options for player interpretation [47]. Just at the
moment, the player gains enough tokens, they can become a puppet master, giving tasks to
the others. This sort of hybrid mode has no winners and losers. It is not necessarily that
Sustainability 2022, 14, 3787 5 of 20
a persona represents one user; some practitioners create a persona based on a mash-up
of users. They extract characteristics from different people and aggregate them into one
persona [48]. In Co-De|GT, users can play for themselves or take the persona of other
living beings. In the application prototype, we classified five types of living creatures as
mash-up personas. When assigning the task, the user also assigns a value to the personas.
Turning to tokenisation, blockchain has emerged over the last decade as a technology
underpinning a speculative new type of digital currency, bitcoin. It is also a financial system
that exploits some of the automation afforded by computer systems [49]. There have been
well documented and publicised problems with this system, which have included fraud
and illicit dark web marketplaces for anonymous trading in drugs [50]. Perhaps most
concerning is its energy consumption. Despite this, blockchain and the experimental cur-
rency bitcoin continue to be used; fortunately, more energy-efficient variants are emerging.
Accordingly, in this research, we focus on the underlying technology and opportunities
blockchain represents for a more socially just economic model. In terms of Gartner’s ‘hype
cycle,’ we appear, however, to have surpassed both the inflated expectation and disillu-
sionment phase of the perception of blockchain. We may be approaching enlightenment
in—if not yet being productive with—blockchain technology. This is not a baseless suppo-
sition. Recently, conservative organizations have been exploring and using it. For example,
the World Food Programme has adopted it to underpin a system that expedites financial
assistance to refugees citing a saving of up to 98% of fees compared with traditional banking
and associated fees [51].
The World Economic Forum has speculated that this ability to reduce fees and red tape
combined with the possibility of new types of community currency and tokenization will
improve access to communities deprived of access to financial systems which is estimated
by the world bank to be approximately 30% of the global adult population [52]. A study
of blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies in the humanitarian sector has
concluded that although transparency and trust are the most cited significant benefits
of the technology, other benefits such as ‘improved efficiency, bureaucracy and project
cost savings’ are important for humanitarian actors [14]. In summary, this research not
only explores initiatives for an ‘other-than-human’ environment, but it also speculates
on the development of a technology that explores the uses of gamification and emerging
technology such as blockchain to scale those initiatives globally to the scale required in
the Anthropocene.
2. Methodology
2.1. Systemic Approach to Architectural Performance
The work is grounded in the Systemic Approach to Architectural Performance method-
ology (SAAP). SAAP is a fusion of several process-based fields and their media and agency,
namely: (a) systems oriented design; (b) performance-oriented architecture; (c) prototypical
urban interventions; (d) Time-based design; (e) Service design; and (f) Co-design, co-
creation and DIY [40]. SAAP combines codesign through gigamapping (see Figures 1 and 2
and prototyping (see Figure 3) and such relations can be found within larger complex sys-
tems [53] (see Figure 2). It is part of the systems oriented design (SOD) [54]. SOD integrates
tools of ‘gigamapping’ and ‘rich design research space’ (RDRS). Gigamapping is a typically
collaborative visual diagramming of complexity, bringing on board multiple perspectives
for ‘codesigning’. ‘Codesign’ in this article is discussed as cocreation where the stakehold-
ers play a creative and active role within the design process as coauthors [55]. A similar
notion to this is often known as ‘participatory design’ within the digital development
community [55]. This appears in the RDRS that offers information, media and stakeholder
richness [56]. In this case, the RDRS is represented through a ‘real-life codesign labora-
tory’ which is a non-reductionist laboratory where the design is tested, developed and
redesigned through real-life interaction in feedback loops in real-life environments [39,40].
Into this laboratory, ‘prototypical urban interventions’ are placed that were invented by
CHORA [57]. These perform as ‘leverage points’ [58]. Leverage point interventions have
Sustainability 2022, 14, 3787 6 of 20
been evaluated as a key strategy in the transformation towards sustainability as reductionist
strategies mainly fail due to the complexity of the real world [59,60]. The methodology
deals with and synergises the ‘prototypical urban interventions’ through physical object
prototypes and their DIY recipes (see Figure 4), the virtual prototypes such as mobile
applications.and public events that promote the prototypes for their DIY reproduction [61].
The DIY reproduction for supporting urban biodiversity has been also discussed by the
London-based group ‘Rewild my Street’ through architectural drawings [62]. However,
this project is bringing a systemic perspective to this concept. The important part of SAAP
is that the analogue-built full-scale prototypical interventions that are placed in the real-life
environment are marked with QR codes which lead to the application with their DIY
recipes. Therefore, the interventions are generative objects to increase the impact of the
project and themselves. The gamified token mobile application relates and supports social
and environmental systems through technology, engaging low-tech DIY recipes to be built
from resources that are available in nature. This way, there is no need for initial investments
when joining the system by replicating the DIY recipes, thus gaining the tokens. This is
critical for handling social and environmental justice from the bottom up, specifically when
we discuss deprived communities with low incomes.

2.2. Gamification Design 
Serious games have emerged as powerful tools in research for understanding, 
analysing and designing complex systems [64,65] such as natural resource governance, 
collective actions coordination, climate change, etc. In 1974, Richard D Duke [66] proposed 
‘Gaming as the Future’s language’ that can sensitise and stimulate a hypothetical world 
to the people giving them an immersive experience with the power to change the 
dynamics of the complex system. The decision made by the players in the game self-
organises the system’s dynamics making the consequences of connected choices visible to 
the player. This provides the best learning-by-doing experience to constantly observe and 
reflect upon an individual’s role in the self-organizing complex systems. This experience 
can encourage people to actively participate in collective prosperity. 
In our research, the city gaming mobile application Co-De|GT was the design 
intervention. It is also a self-evolving tool of progressive research to address and 
understand the dynamic needs of the human and non-human actors of the marginalised 
community of Grangetown, Wales. Co-De|GT is the gaming application designed to 
experience beneficial impacts and to encourage active participation within a marginalised 
community in the replication of DIY recipes of prototyping using a token-based 
blockchain model to support biodiversity. To develop this gaming application, we 
developed a structured framework for translating the complex resource interdependency 
of the human and non-human actors of the community into a token-based economy game 
mechanism. We designed a simple framework ‘Game design Canvas’ for a systemic 
inquiry into the micro-entanglements between networks of stakeholders (humans and 
non-humans) in the existing community to create interdependency mapping. This 
framework was used online on a collaborative platform ‘Miro’ where real-world 
observations gathered from the contextual inquiry into the community were 
systematically projected at different steps of the canvas. The canvas is comprised of 4 steps 
of translation, i.e., contextual inquiry, stakeholder selection, complex interdependence 
mapping of both the selected stakeholder and lastly the translation of the dynamics of 
positive interdependency in the game mechanics to the reward incentives. This process 
created the systemic study, resource interdependency and leverage points visible to the 
participants to make an informed decision about collective actions and gaming incentives 
design. Each layer of this framework encouraged the participants to focus on

brainstorming techniques to map the network’s interdependency between humans and
non-humans, artefacts (stakeholders designed objects), resources and the environment
on each other. Detailed instructions of the brainstorming techniques were explicitly men-

tioned in each layer to translate real-world interdependency into a gamified mechanism
of a token-based economy. The intent and outcome of all the steps are discussed in the
following section.
2.2.1. Step 1: Contextual Inquiry
This step focuses on gathering naturalistic observations of community stakeholders,
(human and non-human) shared resources, environment, biodiversity and existing practices
of the community. Participants were divided into 6 teams with 2 members in each group.
The geographic location of Grangetown was also divided into 6 smaller sections. Each team
conducted an ethnographic field study of the marginalised community of Grangetown
using photo documentation, direct observation, in-depth interviews and focused group
discussions. All the groups collected data and presented the insights in this step. Partici-
pants mapped the problems and opportunities of their site. The contextual inquiry into
all the sites was then presented on the Miro board to understand the emerging issues in
the whole community as shown in Figure 5. This step helped to zoom in and out to look
at the multiple layers and multi-dimensionality of the concerns of this community. Some
interesting insights demonstrated the prevalence of a dog as a pet culture in the community
which emerged as one of the concerns against the loss of biodiversity, as favouring one
restricts the synergy between many other species unintentionally.

each other. Detailed instructions of the brainstorming techniques were explicitly 
mentioned in each layer to translate real-world interdependency into a gamified 
mechanism of a token-based economy. The intent and outcome of all the steps are 
discussed in the following section. 
2.2.1. Step 1: Contextual Inquiry 
This step focuses on gathering naturalistic observations of community stakeholders, 
(human and non-human) shared resources, environment, biodiversity and existing 
practices of the community. Participants were divided into 6 teams with 2 members in 
each group. The geographic location of Grangetown was also divided into 6 smaller 
sections. Each team conducted an ethnographic field study of the marginalised 
community of Grangetown using photo documentation, direct observation, in-depth 
interviews and focused group discussions. All the groups collected data and presented 
the insights in this step. Participants mapped the problems and opportunities of their site. 
The contextual inquiry into all the sites was then presented on the Miro board to 
understand the emerging issues in the whole community as shown in Figure 5. This step 
helped to zoom in and out to look at the multiple layers and multi-dimensionality of the 
concerns of this community. Some interesting insights demonstrated the prevalence of a 
dog as a pet culture in the community which emerged as one of the concerns against the 
loss of biodiversity, as favouring one restricts the synergy between many other species 
unintentionally.

2.2.2. Step 2: Stakeholder Selection
This step focused upon the inquiry into the interdependencies of human and non-
human stakeholders, for example, elderly people with pets as human stakeholders and
hedge dogs as non-human stakeholders. Each group identified and focused only on the
two most important human and non-human stakeholders that were of primary impor-
tance to address certain connected concerns of biodiversity. Participants in all the teams
Sustainability 2022, 14, 3787 10 of 20
explicitly selected and studied this interdependence, such as natural habitats, food, role in
biodiversity and concerns of non-human stakeholders. Similarly, socio-economic concerns,
behavioural aspects, daily routines, role in the community, etc., of the human stakeholder
within the marginalised community were also studied. Primary and secondary data sup-
ported the creation of the profiles of both the stakeholders. This helped to further zoom in
on the behavioural inquiry at the individual level of needs, aspirations, living environment,
everyday behaviour, food security and so on. Details of both the stakeholders established
the role and relevance of each persona/species in enhancing biodiversity.
2.2.3. Step 3: Complex Interdependence
This step provided a structure for brainstorming and mapping the dynamic interde-
pendence and interactions of human and non-stakeholders as shown in Figure 6. In this
task, group members explained the different nature (positive and negative) of interde-
pendency between human and non-human stakeholders such as shared resources, shared
artefacts, shared environment, types of interaction and so on. The stakeholders’ actions
affect each other and the environment for the good or otherwise. The canvas provided six
questions to map the nature of the interdependencies of the stakeholders with the shared
urban environment and resources. The questions were as follows:
I. How do human actions positively affect the environment of the non-human actor?
II. How do human actions negatively affect the environment of the non-human actor?
III. How do the ‘artefacts/products’ used/created/consumed by humans positively affect
the non-human actor?
IV. How do the ‘artefacts/products’ used/created/consumed by humans negatively
affect the non-human actor?
V. How do the ‘artefacts/products’ used/created/consumed by human actions posi-
tively affect the environment of the urban ecosystem?
VI. How do the ‘artefacts/products’ used/created/consumed by human actions nega-
tively affect the environment of the urban ecosystem?

human actors (authorship: Sharma, 2021). 
Participants mapped the direct and indirect multi-level interactions and 
interdependencies of both the human and non-human stakeholders on each other in a 
shared environment of common resources within the urban ecosystem. This helped to 
analyze broader systemic level interdependencies of multispecies in an ecosystem and the 
associated consequences of different kinds of interaction. The positive interaction between 
the human and non-human stakeholders gave directions to create DIY recipes and 
incentive models to encourage active participation to protect biodiversity. Once 
exhaustive observations and mapping were achieved, participants were asked to move to 
the last step of the canvas.  
2.2.4. Step 4: Gaming Mechanics 
The gaming mechanics step provided a sequential brainstorming canvas to think 
collectively about the micro- to macro-level details of the stakeholder interdependency on 
the larger aim of the gamification. The mapping of interdependencies and the interactions 
of human actors on non-humans are translated into gamified rules, incentives, 
interactions, actions, etc., in this step. The canvas is divided into five fundamental layers 
of game development, as shown in Figure 7.

individual level as well as the community level. The WIP application has been tested on
community stakeholders that were wandering in the neighbourhood and the larger variety,
the better. The total number was about thirty. Based on their responses, the application has
been constantly updated.
The Game Design Canvas was created to overcome the challenges of the online
workshop due to COVID-19 restrictions. However, this research tool was a success in
designing the gamified application. Therefore, in the Relating Systems Thinking and
Design 10 symposium [2], we conducted a 3 h workshop to demonstrate and test the
gaming canvas tool. The online tool was contextualised for a different geographical location
of a marginalised community of Bhopal, India to test the effectiveness and generalizability
of the tool. In a very short time, participants of the workshop were able to design interesting
games to promote biodiversity.
2.3. New Token Economies
National currencies are not the only monetary systems that circulate in societies.
This section looks at some of these to contextualise our research and the proposition
of the mobile application, which can be summarised as the intention to underpin an
economy with environmentally conscious behaviour. A token economy can be—loosely—
defined as a method of encouraging desirable behaviour. Tokens are exchanged for specific
behaviour and can be exchanged for desirable things. Typically, a token has no intrinsic
monetary value except within its limited economic and usually geographic area. They have
been criticised when deployed in institutional settings where they have historically been
implemented to modify and ‘correct’ aberrant behaviours.
Complementary currencies are another alternative monetary system; an unofficial
currency that circulates in parallel with a national currency. They are typically set up
by private citizens or advocacy groups and used only within a limited geographic area.
The Bangla-Peso from Kenya and the Fureai Kippu from Japan are well-established exam-
ples [67,68]. The Bangla-Peso is a voucher system that can be traded for limited goods and
services when the national currency is not available. The Fureai Kippu is traded for helping
senior citizens. Unlike token economies, they are not imposed; they operate in parallel with
national currencies and are deployed for more socially conscious reasons. Consequently,
they have significantly more positive associations than token economies.
In addition, there are digital currencies such as M-Pesa that circulate on the African
continent. This currency can be traded via mobile phones and provides access to micro-
financial transactions without the need for a bank account. It is often cited as improving
quality of life by providing access to financial services for the population that cannot access
an official bank account, which in Africa is estimated to be 57% of the adult population.
Sustainability 2022, 14, 3787 13 of 20
However, the M-Pesa has come under criticism for being monopolistic and controlled by
large organizations.
Blockchain offers the potential to take these concepts into the 21st century and ad-
dress some of the shortcomings and criticism of the aforementioned alternative curren-
cies. It is designed and operates without monopolistic control; digital currencies such
as bitcoin also offer the potential to circulate globally. Furthermore, socially conscious
initiatives are beginning to combine the concepts of a token economy and complementary
currency. For example, the Plastic Bank uses these technologies to stimulate a specific
economy around removing waste plastics and redirecting them into a recycling system [69].
The novelty in the original research reported here is that the Co-De|GT application aims not
only to underpin an economy with environmental conscious behaviour but it also extends
existing research to include and support other-than-human species within that economy.
3. The Co-De|GT Mobile Application
3.1. Performance
The Co-De|GT application’s [70] aim is to lower the disbalance across the differ-
ent disadvantaged human and non-human stakeholders. It enables the submission of—
and volunteering in—different tasks that are assigned tokens as a payment. To gain tokens,
one first completes certain tasks. Once someone ‘earns’ tokens and they are deposited in
their wallet, they can assign or create tasks for others. When others compete for those
tasks, they are paid from the assignee’s wallet. At the application’s starting point, only the
Synergetic Landscape unit’s members have tokens. They assign tasks for people to repro-
duce their designed prototypes (i.e., bat or bug hotels, etc.) for expanding cross-species
habitable and edible landscapes. These prototypes are to be built from natural materials
that can be found in the location. Therefore, joining the system does not require any initial
investment [71]. Whilst giving the tasks, the related members of the more-than-human
community are rewarded. Therefore, for planting a tree, one must pay the pollinators. This
way, the pollinators gain their tokens and they might be buying their habitats. Since the
pollinators cannot use the application, they are acted on their behalf by the community
members. Thus, the application questions the traditional winning and losing concept
of traditional games through layering multiple systems and cross-relating their systemic
relations. Non-human species could be acted on behalf by AI as will be explored in the
systemic future visions section.
This unit was mainly developed during the COVID-19 pandemic when direct analogue
social interaction was very limited. Therefore, more attention was paid to online interaction
through social media, a video channel, blogging, etc. The application has been tested
through two online events, the Cardiff University Sustainability Week [72] and the UN
World Creativity and Innovation Day [73]. Later, the application was tested in real life in
the Grangetown community. We organised public picnics using QR codes to introduce the
public to the mobile phone application, as most of Wales has been vaccinated. A poster
with the application’s QR code was presented in the Grangetown Pavilion that was opened
to the public as part of the Community Gateway project in spring, 2021.
The application is an MVP (minimum viable product) prototype. It should differentiate
several local species (see Figure 8). For the initial stage, we selected only the categories
of land, water, sky and underground creatures and the types of tasks in the categories of
community, health, environment, animal and ‘other’. The users can upload their tasks
to the map location with these categories, assigning tokens for completing the task and
assigning tokens to other species that relate to the task. Settings cover a timeframe for
completing the task. The application starts with the DIY edible and habitable prototypes
recipes that are located on the first author’s blog [63]. However, anyone can upload their
recipes for their tasks. The application can place DIY videos from YouTube and other video
channels and blogs. Different community members can act on behalf of other creatures
and extend their habitats and edible landscapes for their tokens by assigning tasks to
Sustainability 2022, 14, 3787 14 of 20
community members. This way, the community members value, appreciate and cogenerate
the quality of their environment and life within the community from the bottom up.

3.2. Technology 
In order to be able to adapt to our user base, we deployed a flexible approach when 
designing the software solution. Although the target audience was set and the personas 
were clear, we were largely unaware of what the reception and adoption [74] of 
technology would be. It was therefore impossible to predict and model the created 
prototype target devices which would most likely span the spectrum of phones and 
operating systems. We did, however, have the confidence to predict that the end-users of 
the application would be in this scenario developed world users;  therefore, we were 
allowed to make an educated guess on the technology we would use. One example is that 
we assumed that our users would be using Android Version 8.0 (codenamed Oreo) or 
above, based on over 90% of UK users employing Android 8.0 [75]. Similarly, we assumed 
that the equivalent iOS user base would be using iOS 12.5 and above, with an over 87% 
market share on Apple Mobile devices [76] This decision created both opportunities for 
us to create the best and safest build, but there are also limitations to our work; namely, 
although the ecological validity of our work will be high, the external validity of our work 
may be limited if we were to replicate the experimentation to less-developed societal 
surroundings. Most importantly, we were also able to establish the likely web browser 
capabilities of these operating systems which gave us more development options with 
regards to compatibility. For these reasons, we decided the application would be 
developed using an HTML-based progressive web application (PWA) approach in order 
to allow for operating system agnostic capabilities and an adaptive design approach [77]. 
This allowed the solution to be accessed via a web browser and made the device and 
operating system agnostic. 
Due to the nature of the application and the natural environment that the application 
would be likely to be used in, one of the challenges that were made evident was that the 
use of the prototype would be limited access to WIFI or even cellular data services such 
as 4G. We were, therefore, inclined to create a web-based application but due to the PWA 
nature, once saved to the home screen of a mobile device (Phone or Tablet/iOS or Android) 
it could be accessed via that link, where all browser-based UI elements are hidden and the 
application behaves as if it is a native mobile application. One can simply access the 
website once and save it to the home screen. This increased the external validity of our 
work, as we can cater for developing country environments, but we note that the

of the operating system mentioned above must also be taken into consideration if the
replication of the findings is attempted.
‘Under the hood’ we employed HTML, HTML5 technologies with Javascript for the
UI and C# for the functionality. We deployed Google Maps (which is a reliable source of
GPS tracking and a location finder carrying several offline capabilities through caching) to
perform the location services and location finders. This was wrapped in a .NET container
for compatibility with the rest of our technology. Finally, the application utilised a database
subsystem on a Microsoft SQL Server with custom firewalls and two-factor authentication
for security. We created differential backups daily and had an uptime of 99.9% as an aim
which is currently successful.
4. Discussion and Conclusions
The potential for blockchain to impact the built environment has been explored else-
where [78], including the specific potential for a radical reconfiguration of the relationship
between people and other agents with which we share the environment, such as animals,
buildings and plants [21]. The World Economic Forum has recognised that blockchain,
crypto-currency and the ‘token economy’ provide a means for 21st century communities
and distributed organisations to reclaim power and enact their values in a way not possible
through 20th century centralised banking, industrial and commerce models [79]. This is
critically important in deprived urban communities, especially in relation to the quality of
human and more-than-human lives and living environment. This project expands further
on this work in two areas: (1) in relation to extending community or ‘complementary’
currencies to circulate beyond traditional geographical limits [80], and (2) the potential for
a crypto-currency economy to support environment regeneration. Unlike existing comple-
mentary currencies, this research has shown the potential for a new type of community
currency that has no geographical limits. The economy it facilitates is not traditional and it
is not based on practices such as material extraction or behaviours such as continued con-
sumption. This economy supports and rewards behaviour that establishes and regenerates
a multi-species environment, whereas traditional economies result in their destruction.
We argue this can also apply across species, things and whatever intelligent systems
(including AI) within such communities. The work here explores how more-than-human
agents can be integrated into our economic models, strengthening clear dependences
and co-performing better through interactions. To expand on such a co-performance, we
need to adapt our cities for coliving with others [61]. This project tried to achieve this
through a gamified token application with free DIY recipes, approaching communities
of makers that have recently questioned the building market [81] and hopefully soon the
building industry. León-Jordán and Kuruvilla projected in 2011 that the mainstream supply
chain of the building industry would change from the traditional model of Supplier—
Manufacturer—Distributor—Retailer and Consumer, to a compact supply chain of Design
and Raw Materials reaching the customer who is also the manufacturer [82]. Many such
initiatives have appeared since the 1960s to fight homelessness and poverty [83]. Boeva
and Troxler point out that the making needs to abandon the market/state duopoly of the
first and second industrial revolution, the market economy based on the assumption of
unlimited growth and the fair functioning of the free market [84]. This project tested how
making could be integrated into the community-based post-Anthropocene economy and
industry for the 21st century that may hopefully become fully Non-Anthropocentric in
the future.
This research has explored how the features of contemporary digital currency can be
combined with concepts of complementary currencies to stimulate an economy of value and
quality of life; an economy of products and services that re-populate the urban environment
with wild-life habitats that will result in a more balanced ecosystem. This was approached
through gamification to engage with the community in a real-life environment and real-life
situations. The central idea of gamification is to take the ‘building blocks’ of games and
to implement these in real-world situations, often with the goal of motivating specific
Sustainability 2022, 14, 3787 16 of 20
behaviours within the gamified situation [85]. The majority of the studies have yielded
positive effects/results from gamification, though gamification is context-dependent [86].
Therefore, it is crucial to test whether this concept can improve the quality of life in specific
communities, such as Grangetown which is listed as one of the most deprived communities
in Wales.
5. Systemic Visions of the Future
The future vision direction of integration of this investigation is a transition towards
post-Anthropocene where different beings (humans, other species, AI, robots) may co-
live in synergy. We are interested in the real-life application, development and testing of
the posthumanist discourse discussed by Haraway and Latour from a more-than-human
perspective [87,88] that has taken place around the world in the last few decades. Municipal
and national governments, along with supra-national states, such as the European Union,
positively endorse the smart city concept as the path to socio-economic progress and more
liveable, secure, functional, competitive and sustainable cities [89]. With the adoption
of emerging technologies such as the Internet of things (IoT) for facilitating smart city
transitions, there has been a surge in the number of sensors and devices within the smart city
ecosystem. With the traction gained by IoT within smart cities, there has been an increase in
the generation of data, which can be leveraged by AI for active training and the operation of
real-time smart machines to automate the provision of certain services. However, the trade-
off between data transparency (and privacy) and the utility of AI in supporting big data
analytics, is the foremost concern for smart city stakeholders. In this context, blockchain
technology is increasingly seen as a tool that can boost data transparency and traceability
in smart cities. As a decentralised IT infrastructure, blockchain technology can serve as
a suitable means to manage the growing networks emanating from smart cities in terms
of monitoring supply chains, executing and validating data trails along with ensuring
authenticity and integrity of data. Blockchain technology through secure and transparent
infrastructure presents opportunities for an immutable and traceable exchange of sensitive
data and property values, not only between people but also between machines [13]. We
are interested in the development of a new model of BioDigital architectural, urban and
landscape interventions for the 21st century through ‘Do-It-Yourself’ (DIY) for biodiversity
loss mitigation with a special focus on the urban environment. In the work presented here,
people traded and supported a multi-species environment. However, we envisage the
possibility of more-than-human species and machines trading autonomously within the
economic ecology. We would like to integrate digital currency with existing ecosystems,
assigning, for example, value to a work of a pollinator or a DIY maker by AI thanks to
robotic and citizen science monitoring evaluations. We want to target the cocreation of
adjustable (parametric) reproducible digital models for DIY that would integrate multi-
being coliving. These models would develop advanced species habitats (i.e., swifts’,
bats’ and insects’ hotels) and edible landscaping (i.e., supporting insects’ habitats that
generate food for swifts and bats) in an urban, peri-urban and rural environment and
their connectivity with wilderness. For the autonomy of the system, we would like to
develop small collaborative robots equipped with sensors that would monitor, maintain and
redesign the prototypes based on the ecosystem’s performance in real-time. The DIY recipes
for the robots would be developed as well. The DIY recipes have the potential to emerge
as a new form of NFT (non-fungible token) in the future to encourage active participation
of people in creating original yet effective DIY prototypes to promote biodiversity for a
healthy coliving environment. This would be evaluated via the blockchain gamified mobile
application. We wish to address our dependency on the overall ecosystem: we do not have
a harvest without pollinators. However, recently, we are facing Anthropocene extinction
and the fact that the urban and other cultural landscapes may play a critical role in this has
been documented by several ecologists.

Bhopal, India and the Auckland University of Technology, New Zealand. The development of the
application was supported by Cardiff University’s internal Global Challenges Research Fund within
the Synergetic Settlements project. It has been developed under the leadership of the paper authors
within the Synergetic Landscapes unit on the Master of Architectural Design program at the Welsh
School of Architecture and analysed by Tomos Wiliams from the School of Computer Sciences, Cardiff
University as part of his Bachelor thesis under the supervision of Alia Abdelmoty. The project is being
integrated within a large Community Gateway project managed by Cardiff University. The unit’s
students involve Yutao Feng, Huicong Meng, Danjian Wang, Yuchen Wang, Meihui Wang, Hussa
Alghunaim, Jiayang Jiang, Kai Huang, Ningjia Cui, Tian Wang, Yuhan Ma, Zhen Zhang, Yuting Xie,
