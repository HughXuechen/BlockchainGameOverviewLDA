Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is the core technology of technological revolution and industrial transformation. As one of 
the new intelligent needs in the AI 2.0 era, financial intelligence has elicited much attention from the academia and industry. In our 
current dynamic capital market, financial intelligence demonstrates a fast and accurate machine learning capability to handle 
complex data and has gradually acquired the potential to become a “financial brain.” In this paper, we survey existing studies on 
financial intelligence. First, we describe the concept of financial intelligence and elaborate on its position in the financial tech-
nology field. Second, we introduce the development of financial intelligence and review state-of-the-art techniques in wealth 
management, risk management, financial security, financial consulting, and blockchain. Finally, we propose a research framework 
called FinBrain and summarize four open issues, namely, explainable financial agents and causality, perception and prediction 
under uncertainty, risk-sensitive and robust decision-making, and multi-agent game and mechanism design. We believe that these 
research directions can lay the foundation for the development of AI 2.0 in the finance field.

1  Introduction 
 
Artificial intelligence (AI), the core technology 
of new technological revolution and industrial trans-
formation, is transcending the traditional means of 
simulating human intelligence by a computer, such as 
man–machine gaming, machine identification, and 
natural language processing. Consequently, a new 
generation of AI, namely, AI 2.0, has emerged. Pan 
(2016) defined AI 2.0 as a new generation of AI based 
on the novel information environment of major 
changes and the development of new goals. As one of 
the new intelligent needs, financial intelligence is a 
highly suitable application setting for AI 2.0. 
AI 2.0 as a core technology is an important 
driving force for the development and transformation 
of the financial industry. Technology-driven financial 
upgrading can be divided into three stages (Table 1). 
The first stage is Fintech 1.0. At this stage, computers 
can be used to replace manual calculation and ac-
counting books to improve the efficiency of financial 
operations. The second stage is Fintech 2.0, which is 
also called “Internet finance.” At this stage, technol-
ogy is a force for financial revolution and provides 
emerging Internet enterprises with the opportunity to 
use Internet technology to connect the supply and 
demand for financial products and services. Internet 
finance becomes an effective supplement to tradi-
tional finance. The third stage is Fintech 3.0, which is 
also known as intelligent finance or smart finance. At 
this stage, financial technology integrates the Internet, 
finance, and big data to achieve intelligent and accu-
rate calculation responsibility and to lead the overall 
change in the financial industry through big data, 
blockchain, cloud computing, AI, and other emerging 
technologies.

Financial intelligence has a fast and accurate 
machine learning capability to achieve intellectual-
ization, standardization, and automation of large- 
scale business transactions. Thus, it can improve ser-
vice efficiency and reduce costs. For example, AI 
technology combined with big data can integrate 
long-tail markets and mitigate information asym-
metry to improve the efficiency of fund allocation and 
financial risk management. Moreover, identity 
recognition and natural language processing tech-
nology can allow machines to replace laborers, realize 
all-around perception, and provide interactive ser-
vices to customers. By combining financial intelli-
gence with the new generation of AI, we can construct 
a “financial brain” that offers inclusive financial ser-
vices to meet the financial needs of ordinary people. 
This stage has the following three important  
characteristics: 
1. Rich usage scenarios 
Many financial applications, such as investment, 
lending, credit, security, insurance, and customer 
service, are inseparable from the support of AI  
technology. 
2. Highly structural business data 
Compared with other industries, the financial 
service industry produces large amounts of structural 
data and thus has the advantage of developing AI 
technology. 
3. Meeting the requirements of inclusive finance 
Traditional professional financial services often 
have a high threshold; thus, the financial needs of 
ordinary people are not well met. The financial 
threshold can be significantly reduced by the effec-
tiveness of credit assessment technology, and im-
proved services can be provided to people. Hence, 
everyone can enjoy a fair opportunity to achieve in-
clusive finance. 
The main purpose of this study is to explore the  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
potential of constructing a “financial brain” in the 
forthcoming era of AI 2.0. To achieve this aim, we 
briefly review the state-of-the-art advances in dif-
ferent areas, including wealth management, risk 
management, financial security, financial consulting, 
and blockchain. We propose a financial research 
framework called FinBrain and discuss several 
emerging open issues from the technical perspective 
to thoroughly understand challenges and future  
directions. 
 
 
2  Research and application 
 
In this section, we briefly review the recent 
progress in different areas of financial intelligence to 
demonstrate that AI technology can improve service 
efficiency and reduce costs. 
2.1  Wealth management 
The need to provide individuals with wealth- 
management services has emerged recently. Exam-
ples of such services include Robo-Advisor, financial 
product recommendation, and precision marketing 
that can help maintain good customer experience 
while mitigating risks and improving individuals’ 
decision-making capabilities. Most wealth managers 
use simple rule-based analytics based on reporting 
systems that cannot effectively characterize custom-
ers’ preferences (Bahrammirzaee, 2010). The new 
generation of AI 2.0 shows a remarkable potential to 
provide enhanced wealth-management services via 
user profiling, predictive analytics (Ding et al., 2015; 
Salinas et al., 2017), the Internet of Things (IoT) 
intelligence (Dineshreddy and Gangadharan, 2016), 
and customized recommendations (Zhao et al., 2014; 
Zhang et al., 2017). For example, smart agents can 
combine structured financial and unstructured

behavioral data to assess customers’ investment style, 
risk tolerance, purchasing preferences, and develop 
optimized portfolios at low costs and high speeds. 
Furthermore, firms can use information from clients’ 
IoT ecosystems to tailor investment decisions and 
asset allocations based on their individual behaviors, 
preferences, and locations. We describe below the 
recent development of two key wealth-management 
applications, namely, financial product recommenda-
tion and Robo-Advisor. 
1. Financial product recommendation 
The key to design a good recommendation sys-
tem is to characterize the preferences of customers 
and construct personalized behavior models. Con-
ventional recommendation approaches have been 
frequently combined with Markowitz’s portfolio 
theory to achieve improved investment recommen-
dations (Zhao et al., 2014, 2016). For example, Zhao 
et al. (2014) constructed a two-step decision-making 
platform for investment recommendation that con-
siders what to buy and how much money to pay. Zhao 
et al. (2016) were the first to assess peer-to-peer (P2P) 
loans from a multi-objective perspective and rec-
ommend portfolios, such as non-default and winning- 
bid probabilities. They combined the static and dy-
namic features of bidding lenders into a gradient 
boosting decision tree (GBDT) framework. Recent 
state-of-the-art recommendation models adopt deep 
neural networks (DNNs) to effectively model highly 
complex rating functions (He et al., 2017) or exact 
high-order feature interactions (Guo et al., 2017), and 
they may open a new avenue of financial product 
recommendation based on deep learning. 
2. Robo-Advisor 
The core task of Robo-Advisor is to build an 
optimized portfolio for asset management using risk 
models, which helps decrease the cost of portfolio 
construction while improving quality. Several re-
searchers have incorporated multi-armed bandits into 
the sequential decision-making process to achieve 
improved portfolio blending (Shen et al., 2015; Shen 
and Wang, 2016), in which online portfolio choice 
algorithms were developed, and the tradeoff between 
exploration and exploitation was further considered. 
Jiang et al. (2017) presented a financial reinforcement 
learning framework based on deterministic policy 
gradient to allocate portfolios continuously and 
maximize the investment return. In their work, an 
environment state was represented by a price tensor 
that summed up the historic price data in the market, 
and the agent’s action was represented by a continu-
ous portfolio weight vector. Recently, Heaton et al. 
(2016b) employed deep learning models (e.g., auto- 
encoders and long short-term memory units) to form 
hierarchical decision models for portfolio construc-
tion and risk management that can reconstruct invis-
ible nonlinear interactions. The authors proposed a 
deep portfolio theory that involves a four-step routine, 
namely, encoding, calibration, validation, and verifi-
cation, to formulate an automated and general port-
folio selection process. Predictive analysis (Ding et 
al., 2015; Salinas et al., 2017) is also critical when 
providing Robo-Advisor services because it offers an 
enhanced understanding of market trends and helps 
identify investment opportunities. 
2.2  Risk management 
Risk management includes identification, 
measurement, and control of financial risks. The tra-
ditional risk management process is highly compli-
cated and relies on the experience of experts. How-
ever, with the combination of smart phones and 
Ecommerce, consumers are allowed to interact with 
merchants conveniently. The Internet is transitional to 
the IoT. Thus, traditional risk management cannot 
meet the financial needs of most people due to their 
high time, manpower costs, and low coverage. 
Meanwhile, AI technology combined with big data 
can help build robust credit systems, assess business 
risks under uncertainty, and achieve anti-fraud func-
tions. For example, diversified data sources can be 
used to build a credit system based on the tree model 
(Yeh et al., 2012), neural network (Khashman, 2010; 
Abdou et al., 2016), and support vector machine 
model (Han et al., 2013). Moreover, businesses rely 
increasingly on AI technology for competitive ad-
vantages, and IoT provides risk managers abundant 
information for assessing and managing risks. For 
example, by using IoT data, such as mobile, house-
hold devices, and other sensing devices, banks can 
analyze geographical data and identify the real trad-
ing environments, so that they can alert the customer 
before someone swipes their credit card in a mall 
(Dineshreddy and Gangadharan, 2016). Hence, oper-
ations do not have to be reinvented. This feature 
provides organizations that are reliant on managing 
Zheng et al. / Front Inform Technol Electron Eng   2019 20(7):914-924 917 
risks with an indispensable tool. In the following, we 
will discuss the four latest key applications of risk 
management, namely, intelligent credit, risk assess-
ment, fraud detection, and bankruptcy prediction. 
1. Intelligent credit 
Credit evaluation is the basis of risk manage-
ment. Traditional financial credit information usually 
includes only strong financial attributes, such as 
credit, credit card, foreign exchange, private lending, 
and other financial transaction data. For example, Fair 
Isaac Corporation (FICO) selects indicators, such as 
the length of residence, job, length of service, 
debt-to-income ratio, and line of credit. Subsequently, 
it calculates the weighted average as the final score on 
the basis of expertise-based rules. Different from 
traditional credit information systems, intelligent 
credit systems, which integrate big data and AI, con-
sider financial, government public service, life, and 
social data (Angelini et al., 2008). These systems 
break the data island and cover diversified data 
sources (Bahrammirzaee, 2010), and their corre-
sponding models are more complex than traditional 
credit models (Hoofnagle, 2014). In addition, deep 
learning (Ha and Nguyen, 2016) is an effective 
method to manage high-dimensional credit charac-
teristic data. ZestFinance is a credit evaluation system 
based on machine learning. It accesses large amounts 
of data from thousands of data items and tens of 
thousands of variables, establishes numerous credit 
risk prediction sub-models, and integrates these 
models into learning to obtain comprehensive credit 
scores. Zhima Credit combines the models of logistic 
regression, neural network, and decision tree, and 
considers five aspects: personal identity, interpersonal 
relationship, credit record history, behavioral prefer-
ence, and individual performance ability. We compare 
the above three personal credit scoring systems in 
Table 2. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. Risk assessment 
Compared with traditional approaches that rely 
heavily on the availability of rich financial infor-
mation and the experience of experts, AI technology 
can automatically identify hidden patterns through 
heterogeneous data sources and can thus achieve 
improved user profiling when assessing risks. For 
example, node2vec (Grover and Leskovec, 2016) and 
struc2vec (Ribeiro et al., 2017) can effectively learn 
the latent representations of a node’s structural iden-
tity. Risk assessment systems can further integrate the 
learnt latent representations into GBDT or DNNs to 
understand the relational network that involves mer-
chants, consumers, investors, and borrowers. Zhou 
et al. (2017) designed KunPeng, a universal distrib-
uted platform for large-scale machine learning. 
KunPeng provides risk estimation for Alibaba’s 
Double 11 online shopping festival and Ant Finan-
cial’s transactions. Khandani et al. (2010) constructed 
a machine-learning forecasting model to estimate 
consumer credit risks, namely, credit-card-holder 
delinquencies and defaults, and further demonstrated 
that aggregated consumer-credit risk analytics may 
have important applications in forecasting systemic 
risks. 
3. Fraud detection 
Fraud detection involves monitoring the behav-
ior of populations of users to estimate, detect, or avoid 
undesirable behaviors. Undesirable behaviors usually 
entail fraud, money laundering, cheating, and account 
defaulting. Outlier detection is the conventional 
technology for fraud detection. Bolton and Hand 
(2001) proposed an unsupervised credit card fraud 
detection method that incorporates other information 
(other than simply the amount spent) into the anomaly 
detection process. Neural networks can also be 
adopted in fraud detection. Aleskerov et al. (1997) 
presented a database mining system called

CARDWATCH for credit card fraud detection. 
CARDWATCH uses a simple neural network to pro-
cess current spending patterns and detect possible 
undesirable behaviors. Zhou et al. (2018) used GBDT 
to resolve fraud detection within bankcard enrollment 
in mobile device payments. Rushin et al. (2017) 
compared the performance of different methods in 
fraud detection and concluded that deep learning is 
the most accurate technique in predicting credit card 
fraud, followed by GBDT and logistic regression 
(LR). 
4. Bankruptcy prediction 
Bankruptcy prediction is the art of forecasting 
bankruptcy and various measures of financial distress 
of public firms. Bankruptcy prediction is relevant to 
creditors and investors in evaluating the likelihood 
that a firm may become bankrupt. Numerous ac-
counting ratios that might indicate danger can be 
calculated, and other potential explanatory variables 
are available. Many studies on bankruptcy and in-
solvency prediction compared various approaches, 
modeling techniques, and individual models to as-
certain whether any one technique is superior to its 
counterparts. For example, Min et al. (2006) applied 
support vector machine (SVM) and the genetic algo-
rithm (GA) to the problem of bankruptcy prediction. 
Kumar and Ravi (2007) presented a comprehensive 
review of research on statistical and intelligent tech-
niques to solve the bankruptcy prediction problem 
faced by banks and firms. Olson et al. (2012) used 
various data mining tools to acquire bankruptcy data 
with the purpose of comparing accuracy and the 
number of rules. 
2.3  Financial identity authentication 
Identity authentication is the key to ensure fi-
nancial information security. Identifying users 
through recognition, image recognition, voice print 
recognition, and optical character recognition (OCR) 
technology would significantly reduce checking costs 
and improve user experience. Identity authentication 
is a complete confirmation process used for the rela-
tionship between an entity and its identity in the 
network world. Government and private organiza-
tions use different biological characteristics to auto-
mate human recognition (Kedia and Monga, 2017).  
In the banking industry, existing applications 
include identity verification, face withdrawals, and 
face recognition payments (Wang et al., 2017). On 
September 1, Alipay’s “face pay” system went online 
at KFC’s KPRO restaurant. The system allows users 
to pay by brushing their faces and is the first com-
mercial use of face recognition technology. It adopts 
EyePrint ID technology in payment scenarios and can 
thus overcome light, expression, makeup, age, and 
even cosmetic technical barriers based on cameras. 
The system can resist attacks. The new iPhone X uses 
Face ID to replace Touch ID for phone unlocking and 
payment certification. To further ensure financial 
security in the era of new technology, recognizing 
user identity and non-face hacks can be an important 
research area. SenseTime’s unique face biometric 
detection technology can effectively prevent various 
non-face hacks and accurately determine the current 
validator for the user, rather than using other 
non-positive photos or videos, to ensure user infor-
mation security. 
Many studies have been conducted on uncon-
strained face recognition using deep learning tech-
nology, such as DeepFace (Taigman et al., 2014) and 
DeepID (Sun et al., 2014b). Sun et al. (2014a) 
demonstrated that deep learning provides a powerful 
tool for undertaking the main challenges in face 
recognition, including reducing the internal differ-
ences and expanding the differences among people. 
Kuang et al. (2015) implemented automatic facial age 
estimation with a deep convolutional neural network 
(CNN) by fusing random forest and quadratic re-
gression with local adjustment. 
2.4  Smart financial consulting 
Recent developments on speech recognition and 
natural language processing enable machine-to- 
human communication via interactive smart Q&A 
interfaces (e.g., chatbot systems such as Eliza, Siri, 
XiaoIce, and Cortana) (Etzioni, 2011; Shum et al., 
2018), and enhance service experience while reduc-
ing costs. Generally, chatbot systems can analyze 
customers’ goals and are highly responsive to cus-
tomers with personalized advice or tailored answers, 
such as investment policies and portfolio strategies. 
The core tasks in designing a smart Q&A system can 
be roughly divided into five procedures: (1) speech 
recognition and synthesis; (2) named entity recogni-
tion and query intention under-standing; (3) sentiment 
analysis and user profiling; (4) knowledge-based 
Zheng et al. / Front Inform Technol Electron Eng   2019 20(7):914-924 919 
question answering (KB-QA); (5) dialogue man-
agement and generation. In this study, we review the 
state-of-the-art approaches on (4) and (5). 
1. KB-QA 
Existing approaches for KB-QA use learnable 
components to either transform the question into a 
structured KB query via semantic parsing (Berant et 
al., 2013; Yih et al., 2015) or embed questions and 
facts in a low-dimensional vector space and retrieve 
the answer by computing similarities (Bordes et al., 
2014; Dong et al., 2015). For example, Yih et al. 
(2015) initially defined a query graph that transforms 
semantic parsing into query graph generation with 
staged states and actions and then used a deep CNN to 
perform semantic matching. A current trend in the 
literature involves the utilization of memory networks 
(MemNNs) (Bordes et al., 2015) and attention 
mechanisms (Andreas et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016) 
to perform KB-QA. Bordes et al. (2015) presented a 
MemNN-based QA system that stores facts from KBs 
via a memory component and performs generalization 
and inference in the memory. Zhang et al. (2016) 
employed an attention model to represent questions 
dynamically according to different answer aspects 
and integrated the global KB information into the 
representation of the answers to alleviate the out-of- 
vocabulary problem. Moreover, Andreas et al. (2016) 
proposed a dynamic neural module network that uses 
a collection of compositional, attentional modules to 
leverage the best aspects of conventional logical 
forms and continuous representations. 
2. Dialogue management and generation 
Practical dialogue systems consist of a natural 
language understanding module, a natural language 
generation module, and a dialogue management 
module with state trackers and dialogue policy that 
tracks the state evolution and chooses an action given 
the current state. Traditional dialogue systems use a 
set of pre-programmed rules and thus cannot cope 
with non-stationary user behaviors (Li et al., 2016). 
Hence, reinforcement learning (Graves et al., 2016), 
in which policies are learned automatically from ex-
perience and evolve from interactions with users, 
offers an appealing alternative (Dhingra et al., 2016, 
Li JW et al., 2017; Li XJ et al., 2017). Dhingra et al. 
(2016) presented an end-to-end RL-based dialogue 
agent called KB-infoBot to perform knowledge-based 
accessing, dialogue state tracking, and policy learning 
under a multi-turn setting. KB-infoBot showed great 
promise when applied to a goal-oriented task. 
Moreover, Li XJ et al. (2017) presented a task- 
completion dialogue system to complete a task (e.g., 
movie ticket booking). The open domain dialogue 
generation problem was considered by Li JW et al. 
(2017), who aimed to generate meaningful and co-
herent dialogue responses. An adversarial dialogue 
generation system was proposed in their work, and 
RL was applied to jointly train two subsystems: a 
generator to produce response sequences and a dis-
criminator to distinguish between the human- 
generated dialogues and the machine-generated ones. 
2.5  Blockchain 
Although the big data era has arrived, data are 
often mastered in different institutions. Data owner-
ship, data security, and credit intermediaries thus 
become barriers to data sharing. A new generation of 
Internet technology is required to solve the problem 
of information decentralization. Hence, blockchain 
was introduced. The concept of blockchain was pro-
posed by Nakamoto (2009). Blockchain, which un-
derpins bitcoin, is a digital currency supported by 
cryptographic methods (a “cryptocurrency”) and is a 
distributed, publicly available, and immutable ledger. 
In finance, blockchain has broad application pro-
spects in digital currency, payment and settlement, 
intelligent contracts, and financial transactions. Typ-
ical applications include bitcoin, litecoin, and other 
electronic currencies, more secure and open distrib-
uted accounting systems, and payment and settlement 
systems. Consensus mechanisms and security guar-
antees are important components of blockchain 
technology. 
1. Consensus mechanism of blockchain 
Reaching a consensus efficiently in a distributed 
system and ensuring the security of transaction data 
are important research issues. Ethereum, the first 
Turing-complete decentralized smart contract system 
(Buterin, 2014), uses proof of work (PoW) to ensure 
the consistency of distributed bookkeeping. However, 
PoW relies heavily on computing power and con-
sumes extensive resources. Researchers have recently 
proposed various consensus mechanisms, such as 
proof of stake (PoS) and Algorand. PoS (Reed, 2014), 
also known as equity proof, changes the computing 
power of PoW to the system rights and interests. The 
Zheng et al. / Front Inform Technol Electron Eng   2019 20(7):914-924 920 
larger the equity is, the greater the probability of be-
coming the next bookkeeper is. The algorand con-
sensus algorithm proposed by Micali (2016) can solve 
the problem of having too many nodes in public 
chains. 
2. Security in blockchain 
Security issues have always been the focus of 
blockchain technology. The PoW mechanism faces 
51% attacks. The PoS mechanism solves the problem 
of 51% attacks to a certain extent but introduces 
nothing at the stake (N@S) attack problem (Rosen-
feld, 2014). At present, no ideal solution is available 
for all types of attacks, and further research break-
throughs are needed. 
 
 
3  FinBrain framework and open issues 
 
In this section, we present FinBrain, a research 
framework, and discuss several emerging issues. 
3.1  FinBrain 
Despite the research efforts devoted to financial 
intelligence, further progress is still needed to develop 
a more advanced technology that meets the require-
ments of inclusive finance. We envision that future 
finance based on AI 2.0 is a finance of AI, where AI 
agents will become more rational than people when 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
making decisions, and a multi-agent system of AIs 
will be the core component of financial transactions.  
Accordingly, we propose a research framework 
called FinBrain and further discuss several emerging 
open issues in Section 3.2. The overall research 
structure includes three main layers: (1) financial big 
data; (2) algorithms and models; (3) products and 
services (Fig. 1). The financial big data layer focuses 
on multi-source heterogeneous information pro-
cessing, such as combining the structural financial 
report data and unstructured behavioral data of fi-
nancial users via a knowledge graph. Through an 
analysis of different financial scenarios, we can en-
hance the perception capability for further prediction. 
The algorithms and model layers aim to support dif-
ferent AI algorithms and models for financial intelli-
gence, such as deep learning, reinforcement learning, 
and combinatorial optimization. Through a new gen-
eration of AI technology, we can further improve the 
decision-making capability and have the potential of 
constructing rational agents. The financial intelli-
gence product and service layers typically includes 
five major financial application scenarios, which have 
been discussed in Section 2. 
3.2  Open issues

including (1) explainable financial agents and cau-
sality, (2) perception and prediction under uncertainty, 
(3) risk-sensitive and robust decision-making, and (4) 
multi-agent game and mechanism design. We believe 
that these open issues and future directions can lay the 
foundation for the development of AI 2.0 in the fi-
nance field. Fig. 2 shows the most common rela-
tionships among issues and applications and research 
topics. We describe these emerging issues in detail. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.2.1  Explainable financial agents and causality 
A key component of financial agents is the abil-
ity to provide explanations for their decisions, pre-
dictions, or recommendations. However, current 
models usually make black-box predictions but rarely 
explain the process of decision-making in a way that 
is meaningful to humans. We stress that explainable 
decisions are important to financial users. For exam-
ple, investors require understanding before commit-
ting to decisions with inherent risks. In general, ex-
plainable agents should be able to identify the prop-
erties of the input (i.e., feature interactions) and are 
responsible for the particular decision and should be 
able to further capture the causal relations to answer 
counterfactual questions. The key to designing ex-
plainable agents is to provide causal inference to 
better understand the real-world environment and 
support interactive diagnostic analysis that faithfully 
replays a prediction against past perturbed inputs to 
measure feature importance. Module neural networks 
(Andreas et al., 2016) may be a suitable choice for 
supporting explainable decisions. These networks use 
dynamic attention mechanisms to form predictive 
network layouts from a collection of composable 
modules. 
3.2.2  Perception and prediction under uncertainty 
 
Given the dynamic nature of financial environ-
ments (e.g., fluctuations in financial markets), per-
ception and prediction agents that provide financial 
insights and reveal what will happen next should be 
able to process incomplete information and capture 
temporal correlation patterns under uncertainty. To 
satisfy these requirements, agents must form inner- 
world models that represent comprehensive 
knowledge about the local environment by continu-
ously perceiving multiple modalities and selectively 
integrating information from unstructured data 
sources. In particular, a memory mechanism (Bordes 
et al., 2015, Graves et al., 2016) with selective read/ 
write heads and memory generalization operation can 
be employed to combine prior knowledge with tem-
poral characteristics of sequences and thus allows 
knowledge evolution along with the dynamic changes 
in financial markets or user interests. Moreover,  
imagination-based reinforcement learning (Hamrick 
et al., 2017) that learns to optimize a sequence of 
imagined internal actions over predictive world 
models before executing them in the real world may 
be a good choice for safe prediction under complex 
nonlinear dynamics. We highlight that these intelli-
gent perception and prediction methods should be 
applied to important financial applications, such as 
market monitoring, risk management, and identity 
authentication, to significantly improve their intelli-
gent services. 
3.2.3  Risk-sensitive and robust decision-making 
In mission-critical applications, such as risk 
management and portfolio recommendation, an im-
portant requirement for financial agents is that they 
must be risk-sensitive and robust to uncertainty and 
errors when making decisions. In general, this issue 
should be considered from two perspectives. On one 
hand, we can build source-specific noise models that 
automatically track data provenance and learn to dis-
tinguish the impact of different data sources with 
confidence intervals (Stoica et al., 2017). On the other 
hand, we can construct risk-sensitive decision models 
that incorporate risk factors into loss functions and 
optimizers under the worst-case scenario. For exam-
ple, instead of the standard risk-neutral Markov

decision process (MDP) based on expectation, Chow 
et al. (2015) proposed a conditional-value-at-risk 
(CVaR) MDP that minimizes a risk-sensitive CVaR 
objective to perform robust decision-making. To as-
sess risks from intelligent adversaries (i.e., adversar-
ial risks), such as competitors or terrorists, we can 
adopt the game-theoretic framework for adversarial 
learning to simulate the adversaries’ strategies and 
enhance security. Counterterrorism modeling and 
generative adversarial networks (GANs) may be good 
choices in this case. 
3.2.4  Multi-agent game and mechanism design 
Financial markets involve assets, traders, online 
platforms, supply chains, and logistics, and they can 
be considered as multi-agent systems (MASs). 
Learning to play a multi-agent game is crucial in 
robust credit systems, supply chain management, 
dynamic asset pricing, and trading mechanism design. 
For example, to achieve dynamic pricing, we need to 
design an effective monetary incentive mechanism 
and capture the supply and demand dynamics in the 
real world. In ecommerce platforms, we can optimize 
different interests and explore the equilibrium state in 
the game of customers, merchants, and recommen-
dation agents to balance platform revenues and user 
experiences. To this end, three challenges should be 
addressed. First, given scalability problems, a small 
number of agents are usually considered, and the 
scalability problems hinder the deployment in busi-
nesses that involve large-scale agents. Second, game- 
theoretic-based agents rely on the assumption of 
perfect rationality of individuals, which is difficult to 
apply to real-world scenarios. Lastly, cooperative 
actions and rewards must be quantified. Moreover, a 
profound discussion has been conducted on the future 
of economic AI, wherein AI agents engage in busi-
ness transactions with other AI agents as well as with 
firms and people. Therefore, we must construct ra-
tional agents, called “machina economicus” (Parkes 
and Wellman, 2015), and design the rules of interac-
tion for AI agents in this new economic system. For 
example, to elicit truthful reports and promote fair 
contributions, we can associate AI systems with a 
reputation to prevent the problems of moral hazard 
and adverse selection and further promote coopera-
tiveness between AI systems when completing fi-
nancial transactions. 
4  Conclusions 
 
With the aid of AI techniques, the financial in-
dustry has changed in all directions, such as diverse 
sources of information collection, intellectualization 
of risk pricing models, standardization of the in-
vestment decision-making process, automation of 
customer interaction services, and other financial core 
fields. These changes are based on two paths: one is to 
improve efficiency and the other is to reduce costs. 
In this paper, we have reviewed extensive theo-
retical studies on industrial applications of financial 
intelligence in the AI 2.0 era. First, we described the 
concept of financial intelligence and elaborated on its 
position in the Fintech field. Second, we described 
several key applications. Finally, we proposed a 
framework of research called FinBrain and summa-
rized four open issues. By presenting the approaches, 
applications, and future directions in the financial 
intelligence field, we drew attention to the state-of- 
the-art advancements and provided technical insights 
by discussing the challenges and research directions 
in these areas. We believed that AI 2.0 is bound to 
move financial services toward the direction of high 
efficiency and intelligence.
