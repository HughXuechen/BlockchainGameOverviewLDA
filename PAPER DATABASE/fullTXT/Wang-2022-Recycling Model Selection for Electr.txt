Abstract: This paper considers a dynamic platform-based, closed-loop supply chain consisting of
a manufacturer and an online platform. As an online distributor of the manufacturer, the platform
expands the market scale by exerting the platform power. At the same time, to solve the problem
of inconsistency between the actual recycling amount and the theoretical recycling amount in the
recycling process of waste electronic products, the whole-process supervision of waste products is
carried out with the help of blockchain technology, which is difficult to tamper with and is traceable.
With the help of differential game theory, four differential game models of manufacturer recycling
and platform recycling with and without blockchain are established. The state feedback strategies
are derived from Bellman’s continuous dynamic programming theory. Through analytical results
and comparative analysis, the adoption conditions of blockchain and the impact of blockchain
on the selection of recycling models are obtained. The results illustrated that the introduction of
blockchain technology effectively improves the real recycling rate of waste electronics, building trust
in consumers, which benefits corporations in certain conditions. However, it amplifies the double
marginal effect of the CLSC. Nevertheless, the implementation of blockchain is still beneficial to
consumers, as the adverse impact of the double marginal effect is compensated by the improvement
in consumer surplus. In addition, the study shows that the implementation of the blockchain
incentivizes members, who benefit on the same recycling model when the fixed cost of the blockchain
and the share ratio of the residual value of waste electronics are between certain thresholds. That is,
both the manufacturer and the platform are better off in a manufacturer recycling model enabled by
blockchain. Moreover, in this model, the social welfare and the recycling rate of waste electronics are
increased, which enable the CLSC to achieve benefits related to economy, environment, and society.

1. Introduction
With the rapid development of information technology and e-commerce, online sales
have become a mainstream sales trend. According to the 2020 Suning Annual Report,
Suning merchandise sales scale was 416.315 billion yuan, of which the online platform
merchandise sales scale reached 290.335 billion yuan, an increase of 21.60% year-on-year,
with the online sales scale accounting for nearly 70%. Online platforms are increasingly
becoming the mainstream sales channels for electronic products. During the 2020 Tmall
“Double Eleven” global shopping event, more than 70 electronic brands, including Apple,
Huawei, Xiaomi, Haier, Gree, and so on, had a turnover of over 100 million. After 10 min
at zero on “Double Eleven”, the turnover of Huawei phones on JD.com increased by more
than 100% year-on-year. In addition to the cell phone category, other digital electronic
products such as high-end HiFi headphones, routers, and high-end thin and light notebooks
all saw a multi-fold growth in sales.
Today, more and more consumers are switching from offline shopping to online, and
more and more manufacturers are relying on online platforms to sell their products. The

advantages of platform sales over traditional offline sales are obvious, as consumers can
purchase products without being bound by time and place. In addition, online platforms
can use the network effect of their own channels or adopt online marketing to expand
the potential demand of the consumer market, which is the unique “platform power”
of platform sales [1]. For example, Tmall and Taobao hired influential celebrities and
weblebrities to broadcast live to promote their products. There is the augmented reality (AR)
experience function launched by Dewu APP, which reduces the uncertainty of consumers
when purchasing products online. “Platform power” enables online retail platforms to
create more demand through their online channels and attract more manufacturers to sell
products through the platform [2].
There are mainly two modes of cooperative sales between the manufacturer and
platforms, namely the platform reselling model (by purchasing products from the manu-
facturer and selling them to buyers) and the platform agent selling model (in which the
manufacturer sells their products directly to buyers). Platform agent reselling is where
the platform receives a commission or a portion of sales from the manufacturer, who sells
directly to the consumer [3]. In the case of electronics, consumers demand electronics more
frequently. Therefore, most platforms use a reselling model when selling electronics in or-
der to gain pricing power over them and thus have better control over price as a marketing
lever [4]. For example, Amazon resells high-demand products such as electronics produced
by upstream manufacturers, while it adopts the agent reselling model for non-mainstream,
long-tail products [5].
Electronics are different from general durable products. With the rapid development
of electronic technology, the replacement of electronic products is extremely fast. Although
it can bring us an improvement in the quality of life, the frequency of elimination is
higher than that of other products. If the discarded electronic products cannot be disposed
of in time, it will bring serious pollutive damage to the ecological environment. For
example, lead in televisions, and arsenic, mercury, and other harmful substances contained
in computers, are extremely harmful to the environment. However, there are many reusable
and even non-renewable resources in waste electronic products, such as aluminum alloys
in computer hard drives, and lithium or nickel-metal hydride batteries in communication
tools, which can be recycled and reused. Electronic products are products with high
recycling value, which have three attributes of fast replacement, environmental pollution,
and resource reuse. Therefore, in order to reduce the impact of waste electronics on the
environment, it is very important to properly recycle waste electronics [6]. Now, many
companies have started to recycle these reusable waste electronic products. The recycling
of waste electronic products is a problem to be solved in practice and theory. The first
and foremost problem to be solved for waste electronic products is the choice of recycling
model for the manufacturer. There are two main types of manufacturer recycling: one is
self-recycling by the manufacturer, and the other is with the help of online platforms or
third-party recycling. The manufacturer’s independent recycling is in direct contact with
consumers and can keep up with the latest product trends and retain accurate information
feedback, thus making the production and sale of products and reverse recycling more
efficient while also maximizing residual value profits. For example, BYD independently
recycles lithium power batteries in electric vehicles. There are also many cases of the
manufacturer using online platforms or third parties for recycling. For example, Aihuishou,
as one of the electronic product-recycling platforms, cooperates with Huawei, Xiaomi,
Apple, oppo, and other mobile phone manufacturers to recycle waste electronic products.
Haier, TCL, Skyworth, and other home appliance companies use third-party recycling
service platforms, combined with their own sales channels and networks, to carry out
used-product recycling and trade-in services across the country with the operation idea
of “Internet + recycling”. Unlike traditional offline recycling, online recycling is becoming
an important recycling method for the manufacturer because it reaches a wider range of
consumers and is more convenient for them. For the manufacturer, both recycling models
have their advantages. At present, however, the incentive for the manufacturer to recycle
Sustainability 2022, 14, 6136 3 of 44
themselves or through platforms remains unclear, especially for electronic products with
environmental pollution and high recycling value. Therefore, the selection of a recycling
model of waste electronic products is one of the key points discussed in this paper.
In addition to the choice of recycling model, the opaque recycling process, lax supervi-
sion, and other problems easily affect consumers’ trust in the recycling of waste products.
Consumers returned used products, but not all of them reached the manufacturer, and the
actual recycling of waste products was far less than the theoretical recycling. It is reported
that, in 2020, the theoretical recycling amount of lithium ion batteries in the Chinese market
reached 478,000 tons, but that the actual recycling amount was only 196,000 tons, account-
ing for only 41% of the theoretical recycling amount. Such false recycling problems will
cause consumers to no longer trust the product, which can affect the brand goodwill of the
product and reduce consumers’ willingness to recycle.
In fact, the effective recycling of waste electronic products restricts the key bottleneck
of recycling waste electronic products. As a distributed accounting technology, blockchain
has the characteristics of visibility, tamper-proof, traceability, decentralization, and the high
reliability of the system, which can verify transactions on peer-to-peer networks and achieve
security, transparency, low transaction costs, and the automation of transactions [7–9]. We
can increase the trust of consumers by using the visibility and traceability features of
blockchain technology to enable the real and effective recycling of waste products. At
present, some enterprises have applied blockchain technology in the recycling process of
waste products. For example, BASF ag in Canada has increased the recycling utilization
of plastic products and improved the circularity of its supply chain through reciChain, a
distributed ledger blockchain platform. Moreover, because of reciChain’s transparency, the
platform can better assure brand owners that their recycling certificates are valid, thereby
increasing consumer trust. The recycling and treatment of waste electronic products mainly
involve two fields of renewable resources and environmental protection. A relatively
perfect management system has been formed for green design and the manufacturing,
recycling, treatment, remanufacturing, and disposal of the resources of electronic products,
with strict reference standards. Therefore, waste electronic products are easier to “record
on the chain” than other products, and the process of “recording to the chain” will be more
standardized and standard.
Considering the successful application of blockchain in the recycling of waste products
in practice, this paper introduces blockchain technology into the closed-loop supply chain
as an important technical tool to regulate the recycling of waste products and improve
consumer trust. However, considering the excessive cost of introducing blockchain, the
circumstances under which enterprises introduce blockchain is also one of the focuses of
this paper.
As a result, this paper explores the following three questions:
RQ1: Under what conditions does the recycler choose to implement blockchain technology
to increase the amount of real recycling of waste products?
RQ2: What are the impacts of the implementation of blockchain technology on pricing and
marketing strategies as well as the recycling model selection?
RQ3: How to take advantage of the combination of blockchain and recycling model to
enhance the triple benefits of economy, environment, and society in the CLSC?
In order to solve the above three problems, this paper considers four strategies for
choosing the reverse recycling model of used electronics: (1) manufacturer recycling model
without blockchain technology (NM); (2) platform recycling model without blockchain
technology (NP); (3) manufacturer recycling model with blockchain empowerment (BM);
(4) platform recycling model with blockchain empowerment (BP). In this paper, we
assume that the introduced blockchain is a recycler-built permission blockchain and study
the impact of permission blockchain on the recycling options of waste electronics in a
platform-based, closed-loop supply chain. In terms of economic, social, and environmental
considerations, a recycling model is the optimal choice. In addition, we consider that the
recycler does not have the ability to build the blockchain by themself. The recycler can
Sustainability 2022, 14, 6136 4 of 44
introduce blockchain technology through cooperation with a third party to influence the
choice of recycling model of waste electronics.
Our paper contributes to both practical operation and theoretical research. In terms
of theoretical research, it helps to further sublimate the research of a closed-loop supply
chain under new technology (platform) and fills the research gap of platforms having both
sales and recycling functions in a platform-based closed-loop supply chain. In terms of
practical operation, when the cost of introducing blockchain is between two thresholds
and the manufacturer choose the manufacturer recycling model, the platform can benefit
from it, the supply chain can reach coordination, and the benefits related to the economy,
environment, and society can be improved. It provides some reference for how enterprises
can better improve their economic efficiency and fulfill their social responsibility with the
help of blockchain technology.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we summarize the
relevant literature. Sections 3 and 4 introduce the relevant models and analyze the optimal
equilibrium strategy under each recycling model. Section 5 introduces the implementation
conditions and implementation value of blockchain technology. Section 6 assigns exogenous
parameters to introduce the influence of blockchain on the choice of recycling model from
the perspective of economy, environment, and society. We expand the model by assuming
that the recycler cooperates with third parties, and the optimal equilibrium strategy under
each recycling model when renting the blockchain technology is discussed in Section 7.
In Section 8, the conclusions drawn in this paper are summarized and the important
implications are discussed.
2. Literature Review
The main studies related to this paper can be divided into three categories: elec-
tronic products’ supply chain, the choice of recycling models for used products, and the
application of blockchain in the supply chain.
2.1. Electronic Products Supply Chain
Unlike other durable goods, electronic products tend to have a short life cycle, fast
response time, high pollution, and high recycling value. With low recycling rates and
a lack of government and consumer involvement [10], waste electronics have become
one of the fastest growing waste streams in the world, with a significant impact on the
earth’s environment. Therefore, the research on the recycling of waste electronics has high
theoretical and practical value.
Due to the above characteristics of electronic products, Yang et al. [11] argued that
electronics will face the risk of rapidly increasing technological innovation, which will
lead to a significant decrease in parts cost, sales price, and demand. Tansel [12] also
pointed out the challenges associated with the increase in the amount of waste electronics.
Wang et al. [13] studied how high-tech electronics companies can coordinate environmental
protection and social responsibility while gaining profits in order to promote the sustainable
development of the electronics supply chain in response to the problems of the rapid
replacement of electronic products and high obsolescence rates, considering that precious
metals in waste electronics can bring huge economic benefits to the recycling industry.
Kumar et al. [14] highlighted the importance and benefits of recycling waste electronics
and emphasized the importance of recycling facilities. Wang et al. [15] pointed out that the
recycling of waste electronics has become a key bottleneck for the proper disposal of waste
electronics for reuse and recycling and analyzed the barriers to waste electronics enterprises
by various stakeholders in China. They showed that it is important for the government
to provide some subsidies, tax breaks, and other support to formal recycling enterprises.
Zlamparet et al. [16] confirmed various views on the feasibility of remanufacturing in the
waste electronics industry and showed that the potential for buyback can be increased
by implementing good management, eco-design, and the reuse of waste electronics, thus
avoiding major barriers such as environmental concerns and consumer acceptance.
Sustainability 2022, 14, 6136 5 of 44
In summary, research on the recycling of waste electronic products is crucial due
to their rapid renewal, high pollution, and high recycling value attributes. Moreover,
electronic products such as high demand products and the platform adhere to “no time, no
space” restrictions on the sales characteristics, so most of the electronic products will be sold
on the platform. We expand on the advantages of platform sales and further consider the
platform as a recycler to explore the issue of recycling model options for waste electronics.
2.2. Selection of Recycling Model for Waste Products
In recent years, with the proposal of sustainable development, many the manufacturer
save costs by recycling and remanufacturing activities. At present, there are many litera-
tures on the analysis of the reverse recycling of waste products, and some results have been
achieved on the issue of reverse recycling model selection.
Around this theme, scholars have considered factors affecting the choice of recycling
model, such as competition in recycling channels, the costs and benefits of remanufacturing,
and the adoption of new recycling technology (platform). In terms of considering recycling
channel competition. Savaskan et al. [17] explored the issue of recycling channel selection
for waste products and found that retailers recycled at a higher rate than the manufacturer
and third parties when other conditions are the same. Wu and Zhou [18] extended the
model of Savaskan et al. (2004) to examine the influence of supply chain competition
on the manufacturer’s choice of optimal recycling channels. The results showed that the
manufacturer adopted a manufacturer-managed recycling strategy. Liu et al. [19] showed
that the dual manufacturer-retailer recycling model is the best recycling choice model for
the manufacturer, regardless of the intensity of competition. Huang et al. [20] showed that,
in the forward supply chain, the manufacturers sell products through retailers, while, in the
reverse supply chain, retailers compete with third parties to recycle waste products. The
results showed that a single recycling channel model for retailers is always better than the
third party model. In terms of considering the costs and benefits of remanufacturing. Hong
et al. [21] considered the effect of advertising on consumers’ acceptance of re-products and
compared the performance of a closed-loop supply chain under the mode of manufacturer,
retailer, and third party recycling. He et al. [22] showed that retailers’ participation in
recycling competition leads to an increase in the manufacturers’ remanufacturing costs,
which is not conducive to improving recycling efficiency. In considering new recycling
technology (platform). Wang et al. [23] pointed out that platforms can increase consumers’
willingness to recycle online by publishing green information such as environmental
knowledge about product recycling and corporate social responsibility online. Liu and
Huang [24] considered the option of e-commerce platform recycling in the reverse recycling
process and showed that the best strategy for the manufacturer and the platform is a
separate recycling model for e-commerce platforms when the recycling price sensitivity
is low.
The research on the selection of a recycling model for waste electronics is as follows.
Liu et al. [25] in the context of recycling waste batteries from new energy vehicles found that
manufacturer recycling models can generate higher profits for closed-loop supply chain
systems, though may create environmental burdens. Chuang et al. [26] studied the problem
of recycling model selection for high-tech electronics, which are characterized by short
life cycles and fluctuating demand. It was found that manufacturer recycling is optimal
when recycling costs exhibit diseconomies of scale, and that retailer recycling outperforms
manufacturer and third-party recycling when recycling costs exhibit economies of scale.
Xue et al. [27], aiming at the inefficiency of recycling and management of electronics in
China, examined and compared the impact of closed-loop supply chain recycling and
remanufacturing strategies on total supply chain revenue and the market share of two
manufacturers, combined with the implementation of the Gree and Haier renewable energy
projects. It was found that optimizing the incentive strategy between the manufacturer and
retailers can effectively improve retailers’ motivation to recycle. Moreover, retailers can
improve recycling efficiency by increasing recycling channels.
Sustainability 2022, 14, 6136 6 of 44
Most of the above studies are related to the offline recycling of waste products, and
the recycling channels are mainly focused on the manufacturer, retailers, third parties,
or online platforms for recycling; however, there are relatively few studies on recycling
by the manufacturer with the help of online platforms. Particularly in the recycling of
waste electronics, there is little research that considers both platform sales and recycling
functions. This paper studies the selection of the recycling model of waste electronic
products empowered by blockchain in a closed-loop supply chain on the basis of platform
resale. This study aims to fill the gap of such research.
2.3. Application of Blockchain Technology in Supply Chain
Blockchain is a unique information technology with decentralized structure, dis-
tributed storage mechanism, consensus algorithm, smart contract, asymmetric encryption,
and other functions. It has the “4T” technology features of traceability, transparency, trust,
and transaction, ensuring the security and transparency of network information [28]. Al-
though the development and application of blockchain technology is still in its infancy,
it has been accepted by more and more groups and organizations in recent years, and its
application potential has been recognized by more and more industries. We review the
relevant literature on the application of blockchain technology in the supply chain in recent
years and analyze and summarize the benefits and challenges brought by the application
of blockchain technology in the supply chain combined with the technical characteristics
of blockchain.
Babich and Hilary [29] summarized five key advantages and five major weaknesses of
blockchain technology in operations management. They also pointed out that blockchain
technology improves supply chain operations through its advantages of transparency,
information aggregation, information verification, automation, and system resilience,
thereby creating a more stable, secure, efficient, ethical, and robust supply chain sys-
tem. Lim et al. [30] pointed out that blockchain enables supply chain information sharing,
maintains traceability throughout the process, and improves the efficiency of supply chain
operations. Moreover, blockchain technology will bring disruptive changes to supply chain
operations. Wang et al. [7] stated that blockchain overcomes the barriers of distrust, privacy
issues, data misuse, and information asymmetry in information sharing between upstream
and downstream of the supply chain by creating a transparent, trustworthy, and fair mech-
anism for sharing supply chain information. With the transparent and trustworthy nature
of blockchain technology, Yu et al. [31] showed that small- and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs) can use self-guarantees to obtain loans from financial institutions and showed that
platform guarantees with the help of blockchain are more efficient and market-effective
compared to traditional platform guarantees. Shen et al. [32] categorized consumers into
professional and novice types and explored the market conditions for brands and manufac-
turers to effectively combat counterfeit products by using blockchain technology. Cai and
Choi [33] analyzed a supply chain model with the presence of a platform and found that
the presence of a platform leads to a “triple marginal effect”, particularly that labeling con-
tracts can coordinate the supply chain but may lead to moral hazard problems for retailers.
The introduction of blockchain can effectively avoid moral hazard while coordinating the
supply chain. Chod et al. [34] investigated the problem of asymmetric information from
lenders to borrowers, specifically their operational capabilities, and studied the impact of
two types of information reflecting borrowers’ operational capabilities: lenders’ application
information and blockchain-recorded inventory transaction information on financing. The
study found that transparent inventory transaction information will produce less distortion
in business financing. With the traceable characteristics of blockchain technology, Hastig
and Sodhi [35] addressed the need for traceability systems in cobalt mining and phar-
maceuticals industries, and presented the industry needs and critical success factors for
blockchain implementation, laying the foundation for blockchain applications in the supply
chain. Wu et al. [36] investigated the optimal strategy for different member-led blockchain
construction in a fresh produce supply chain consisting of suppliers, third-party logistics
Sustainability 2022, 14, 6136 7 of 44
service providers, and e-retailers, aiming at issues such as perishability and difficulty in the
traceability of fresh produce. The study found that blockchain implementation was related
to the consumer acceptance of products without blockchain technology, product spoilage
rate, and the proportion of traceability costs borne by members when adopting blockchain.
Liu et al. [37] proposed a five-layer smart traceability platform based on blockchain and the
Internet of Things (IoT) to provide drug traceability and visibility solutions for the drug
supply chain in response to the inability of pharmaceutical companies to address potential
data manipulation and conflicts of interest by using traditional traceability platforms for
controlling drug quality and improving transparency.
In summary, the application of blockchain in supply chain management mainly focuses
on the forward sales process of products, mostly relying on the trust, traceability, visibility,
and other characteristics of blockchain technology, focusing on the research of product
traceability and anti-counterfeiting. The theoretical research results of blockchain in the
reverse recycling of waste products are rarely reported, especially in the electronics industry.
This paper mainly relies on the transparency and traceability of blockchain technology
to strengthen the supervision of the reverse recycling process and promote the real and
effective recycling of waste electronic products in the closed-loop supply chain.
In order to sort out the studies related to this paper and highlight the contributions
of this paper, some representative articles are listed, compared, and analyzed in Table 1,

3. Model Description and Assumptions
A two-level, closed-loop supply chain system consists of a manufacturer M and a
retailer platform P, in which the manufacturer is responsible for the remanufacturing
activities of waste electronics. Assume that the quality of the remanufactured product is the
same as that of the new product. In the forward selling process of electronic products, the
manufacturer decides the wholesale price w(t) of the product, and the platform purchases
the product from the manufacturer and sells it to consumers and determines the retail price
p(t) of the product. The platform promotes the demand of the consumer market through
certain marketing efforts s(t). In the reverse recycling process, whoever does the recycling
invests in the corresponding recycling effort u(t). The Stackelberg differential game is
played in a power structure where the manufacturer is the channel leader and the platform
is the channel follower. The relevant assumptions of this paper are as follows.
We considered four different recycling models, i.e., the manufacturer recycling model
NM and the platform recycling model NP without blockchain technology, and the manu-
facturer recycling model BM and the platform recycling model BP with blockchain empow-
erment, as shown in the Table 2.

Marketing investment can improve the visibility of the product and win consumers’
good impression of the product so as to improve the brand goodwill of the product. In
this paper, brand goodwill of the product is taken as the state variable of the model, and
the Nerlove–Arrow (1962) [38] model is used to portray the impact of marketing efforts on
brand goodwill. The dynamics of brand goodwill change is modeled without blockchain
technology as follows:
.
G(t) = ρs(t)− (δ + 1− ξ)G(t), G(0) = G0 (1)
where s(t) represents the marketing efforts of the platform, ρ > 0 is the influence coefficient
of marketing efforts on brand goodwill, and δ > 0 represents the normal decay rate of
goodwill caused by the consumer forgetting effect. G0 represents initial goodwill. When
the recycler does not implement the blockchain, ξ ∈ [0, 1] represents the ratio of the
actual recycling volume of waste electronic products to the theoretical recycling volume,
namely, the real recycling rate. 1− ξ represents a false ratio. This false recycling will make
consumers who return waste products distrust the recycling party, thereby dampening the
goodwill of the product brand.
When the recycler implements the blockchain, the recycling process of waste elec-
tronic products is made more transparent by utilizing the visibility and traceability of the
blockchain technology. It can effectively supervise the recycling process of waste electronic
products, so that the actual recycling amount is consistent with the theoretical recycling
amount, that is, ξ = 1. Therefore, in the case of the introduction of blockchain, the dynamic
equation of brand goodwill can be expressed as:
.
G(t) = ρs(t)− δG(t), G(0) = G0 (2)
Positive consumer market demand is always positively related to the product’s brand
goodwill G(t), that is, the higher the brand’s goodwill, the more trust it will gain from
consumers, thereby increasing market demand. The demand of the consumer market and
the retail price of the product p(t) is always negatively correlated, that is, the higher the
price of the product, consumers may choose to give up buying the brand product or switch
to other brands, which will lead to a lower demand for the brand’s product in the consumer
market. Therefore, the demand function of the consumer market can be expressed as:
D f (t) = (θ + λ)
√
G(t)− βp(t) (3)
where θ > 0 represents the coefficient of goodwill’s influence on the basic size of market de-
mand, and θ
√
G(t) reflects the market demand due to the brand’s own influence. λ
√
G(t)
represents the expansion of the potential market size due to “platform power” when the
manufacturer sells products at the platform, and λ > 0 reflects the size of this “platform
power”. The square root of brand goodwill’s influence on demand reflects the saturation
effect of brand goodwill’s influence on market demand. β > 0 is the price sensitivity
of consumers.
The recycling amount of waste electronics is affected by the recycling effort u(t),
assuming that the theoretical recycling amount Db(t) of waste electronics is:
Db(t) = a + εu(t) (4)
Sustainability 2022, 14, 6136 9 of 44
where a > 0 is the basic recycling amount of waste electronics, and ε > 0 represents the
impact of the recycling efforts of the recycling party on the theoretical recycling amount
of waste products. When blockchain is not implemented for recycling, there is always the
possibility of false recycling, and the real recycling volume is lower than the theoretical
recycling volume because the recycling process is not transparent and cannot be effectively
monitored. Suppose the real recycling volume of waste electronics is ξDb(t). When the
recycler implements the blockchain, the real recycling volume is equal to the theoretical
recycling volume, that is, ξ = 1.
In order to conform to the actual operation rules of the market, D f (t) > Db(t), namely
a < (θ + λ)
√
G(t)− βp(t)− εu(t), should be guaranteed. In addition, according to the
research of Giovanni [39] and Liu et al. [40], it is assumed that the recycling cost Cu(t) of
the waste electronic products of the recycler and the online marketing cost CP(s(t)) of the
platform are: {
Cu(u(t)) = 1
2 kuu(t)2
CP(s(t)) = 1
2 kss(t)2 (5)
where ku, ks > 0 represents the recycling cost coefficient and online marketing cost coef-
ficient, respectively. The marginal revenue of the manufacturer mainly comes from the
wholesale price w(t) of electronic products and the recycling and remanufacturing ∆ξ,
where ∆ is the marginal residual value of waste electronic products, which is also expressed
as the marginal cost that can be saved by remanufacturing waste electronic products [41].
The marginal revenue of the platform mainly comes from the sales activities of products.
The implementation cost of blockchain technology is F, which is an exogenous variable [32].
In the extended model, we further consider the assumption that the blockchain implementa-
tion cost is a unit cost scenario to test the robustness of the model results. The manufacturer
and the platform have the same time discount rate r, and each seeks to maximize its own
profit within the planning period [0,+∞). In the manufacturer recycling model, the present

technology is used are:

In the platform recycling model, the manufacturer enters into revenue sharing con-
tracts with the platform for the residual value of waste electronics to incentivize the platform
to recycle waste electronics. In this case, the residual value obtained by the platform is
(1− α)∆ξDb(t), ξ ∈ [0, 1]. The residual value benefits obtained by the manufacturer and
the platform under different recycling modes are shown in Table 3. Where α denotes
the residual value sharing ratio of waste electronics, also known as the revenue sharing
coefficient. Thus, in the platform recycling model, the present value of the manufacturer’s
profit and the present value of the platform’s profit without and with the blockchain

4. Model Analysis
Based on the problem description and decision assumptions in the previous section,
this section first discusses NM and NP in the benchmark model. Secondly, we explore BM
and BP. The optimal steady-state strategies and profits of supply chain participants and
brand goodwill under four different recycling models are obtained. In addition, we also
analyze consumer surplus and social welfare under each model.
4.1. Manufacturer Recycling Model without Blockchain Technology (NM)
In the benchmark model without the use of blockchain technology, the manufacturer
and the platform take the maximization of their own profits as the business objective and
carry out Stackelberg differential game, dominated by the manufacturer in the planning
period. In the recycling model dominated by manufacturer channels, the game order
is as follows: the manufacturer first determines the wholesale price w(t) of the product.
In the recycling process, in order to increase the recycling volume of waste electronics,
the manufacturer needs to determine its recycling effort u(t). The platform purchases
products from the manufacturer and resells them to consumers and determines the retail
price p(t). In the sales process, in order to expand consumer market demand, the platform
needs to conduct marketing activities and determine its marketing effort s(t). The goal
of the manufacturer and the platform is to maximize their respective profits by offering
Sustainability 2022, 14, 6136 11 of 44
the optimal price. When waste electronics are recycled through the manufacturer, the
optimization problems are as follows:

Proposition 1 states that all optimal policies are invariant over time. From a manage-
ment point of view, it is easier to implement a constant price, effort decision, and marketing
decision. We can more intuitively see that these decision variables are relatively static. The
greater the impact of brand goodwill on consumer market demand (i.e., the greater the θ),
the more the platform will invest in marketing efforts. In addition, cost parameters, decay
rate, and discount factor have a negative impact on the corresponding decisions.
The consumer surplus CSNM and social welfare SWNM under the manufacturer’s

4.2. Platform Recycling Model without Blockchain Technology (NP)
In the benchmark model without blockchain technology, the platform recycling model
is the same, wherein the manufacturer prioritizes the wholesale price w(t) of the product.
The platform determines the retail price p(t) of the product and the marketing effort s(t).
The difference is that, in order to increase the recycling volume of waste electronics, its
recycling effort u(t) is determined by the platform. The manufacturer and the platform
take profit maximization as the decision-making goal, respectively, and their differential
game model is as follows:

Proposition 2 is very similar to Proposition 1. The wholesale price and the retail price
of electronics and the marketing effort of the platform are the same; the difference is that, in
the platform recycling model, the amount of recycling effort invested is determined by the
platform, therefore the profit of the manufacturer and the platform varies slightly. In the
manufacturer recycling model, the residual value of recycled waste electronics belongs to
the manufacturer, that is, ∆ξDNM
b . During platform recycling, the residual value of recycled
waste electronics will be divided into the platform part (α ∈ [0, 1]), namely α∆ξDNP
b . The
residual value obtained by the manufacturer is (1− α)∆ξDNP
b , and the share ratio α is
going to be between 0 and 1. The manufacturer encourages the platform to recycle by
increasing the profits of the platform.

4.3. Manufacturer Recycling Model Empowered by Blockchain (BM)
In the manufacturer recycling model empowered by blockchain, the marginal revenue
of the manufacturer will add a fixed cost F of using blockchain in addition to the marginal
revenue w(t) of product wholesale, ∆ of recycling and remanufacturing, and the marketing
effort u(t) to increase recycling. The blockchain technology used here is self-built by
the recycler, therefore there is only a fixed cost F, assuming that the cost per unit of
blockchain consumed per recycling is zero (as discussed in Section 7, when recyclers
introduce blockchain technology in partnership with third parties). Therefore, when
Sustainability 2022, 14, 6136 13 of 44
waste electronic products are recycled by the manufacturer empowered by blockchain, the
optimization problems are as follows:

Proposition 3 is basically similar to Proposition 1, albeit with three main differences.
First, the real recycling rate ξ is 1 when using blockchain technology, which ensures that
no loss and malicious damage to goods will occur during the recycling process. A false
recycling rate of 0 will not have a negative impact on brand goodwill. As a result, the brand
goodwill of the product is also improved. Second, when the true recycling rate ξ equals 1,
the investment of the recycling effort will increase, thus increasing the recycling amount
of reverse waste electronics. Third, the introduction of blockchain technology incurs a
fixed cost F, and the manufacturers are likely to introduce blockchain technology only if
F < r

4.4. Platform Recycling Model Empowered by Blockchain (BP)
In the blockchain-enabled platform recycling model, the platform will introduce
blockchain technology to generating a fixed cost F. Thus, the main sources of marginal
revenue for the platform are the sales activity of the product (namely, p(t)− w(t)), the
marketing effort s(t) invested by the platform, and the fixed cost F of the blockchain.
Sustainability 2022, 14, 6136 14 of 44
Therefore, when blockchain-enabled waste electronics are recycled through the platform,
and the manufacturer and the platform maximize their respective profits by offering the
optimal price, and the optimization problem is as follows:

Proposition 4 is essentially similar to Proposition 3 in that the wholesale price and

5. Implementation Conditions and Value of Blockchain Technology
In this section, we first compare the optimal steady-state profit under the four recycling
models, and then we analyze the manufacturer and platform preferences in the scenarios
of the four recycling models. Finally, the consumer surplus and social welfare in different
recycling models are analyzed, and it is concluded that the profit (economics) and social
welfare (society) of each participant we are concerned about are improved when using
blockchain technology. (In the numerical example in Section 6, it is concluded that the
Sustainability 2022, 14, 6136 15 of 44
recycling rate of waste electronic products is also significantly improved with the use of
blockchain technology.)
5.1. Implementation Conditions of Blockchain
In the manufacturer recycling model, the manufacturer’s profit and platform profit
are compared respectively when blockchain technology is used and not used, and the
following propositions are obtained.

the manufacturer’s profit when using blockchain technology is greater than when not using it in the
manufacturer recycling model, i.e., VBM
M∞ > VNM
M∞ . That is, using blockchain technology is better
than not using blockchain technology for the manufacturer.
Secondly, the impact of the presence or absence of blockchain technology on their profits was com-
pared from the perspective of the platform. VNM

compared respectively with and without blockchain technology, and the following propositions
are obtained.

It is found that the manufacturer profit, when blockchain technology is used, is greater than
when not used, that is, VBP

M∞. For the manufacturer, using blockchain technology is always
better than not using blockchain technology in platform mode recycling.

When the fixed cost of blockchain is F < B, in both recycling models, the economic benefit
of using blockchain technology is better than that of not using blockchain technology, both for the
manufacturer and the platform.
5.2. Implementation Value of Blockchain
In the absence of blockchain technology, we will compare the profits of the manufac-
turer and the platform under the manufacturer recycling model and platform recycling
model, respectively, and arrive at the following proposition.
Proposition 8. Without the use of blockchain technology, the manufacturer will choose the manu-
facturer recycling model; however, the platform does not benefit more from it, and the supply chain
cannot reach coordination.
In the absence of blockchain technology, we first compare manufacturer profits under
the manufacturer recycling model versus the platform recycling model. From Propositions
1 and 2, we can conclude that VNM
M∞ − VNP
M∞ = α ∆ξ
r a + (∆ξε)2
rku
[
1
2 − (1− α)α
]
> 0; there is
always VNM
M∞ > VNP
M∞. Therefore, when blockchain technology is not used, it is always
better for the manufacturer to choose the manufacturer recycling model than the platform
recycling model. Then, we compare the profit of the platform in both models analytically;
again, by Propositions 1 and 2, we can conclude that VNM
P∞ −VNP
P∞ = − α∆ξ
r
(
a + αε2∆ξ
2ku
)
< 0;
there is always VNP
P∞ > VNM
P∞ . Therefore, the platform recycling model is always better
than the manufacturer recycling model for the platform when blockchain technology is
not used. Overall, without blockchain, the manufacturer will opt for the manufacturer
recycling model without the platform gaining more revenue from it, thus the supply chain
cannot be coordinated.
With the introduction of blockchain technology, the profits of the manufacturer and
the platform under the manufacturer recycling model and platform recycling model are
analyzed and compared, resulting in Proposition 9, as follows.
Proposition 9. When the self-built cost of blockchain α∆
(
a + αε2∆
2ku
)
< F < α∆a + (∆ε)2
ku[
1
2 − (1− α)α

, the manufacturer chooses the manufacturer recycling model, and the platform can
also gain more revenue from it, and the supply chain reaches coordination.
With the introduction of blockchain technology, we first analyze and compare the man-
ufacturer’s profit under the manufacturer recycling model and the platform recycling model.
From Propositions 3 and 4, we can derive VBM

,
the manufacturer’s profit under the manufacturer recycling model is greater than that un-
der the platform recycling model, VBM
M∞ > VBP
M∞, namely, the manufacturer recycling model
is superior to the platform recycling model for the manufacturer. Secondly, we analyze
and compare the profit of the platform under the two recycling models, VBM
P∞ − VBP
P∞ =

. When the fixed cost of blockchain F < α∆
(
a + αε2∆
2ku
)
, the profit of the
platform under the manufacturer recycling model is smaller than those under the platform
recycling model, VBM
P∞ < VBP
P∞. That is, the platform recycling model is better than the
manufacturer recycling model from the perspective of the platform.
From the above comparative analysis, it is clear that, when the manufacturer and the
platform have the ability to build their own blockchain technology, the manufacturer will
gain more from the manufacturer recycling model, while platforms will gain more from the
platform recycling model. For the above two ranges, we take an intersection of the fixed cost
F of blockchain, that is, α∆
(
a + αε2∆
2ku
)
< F < α∆a + (∆ε)2
ku
[
1
2 − (1− α)α
]
. When F is within
this interval, the manufacturer recycling model outperforms the platform recycling model
from the perspective of both platform and manufacturer. In general, when the fixed cost
α∆
(
a + αε2∆
2ku
)
< F < α∆a + (∆ε)2
ku
[
1
2 − (1− α)α
]
for self-built blockchain, the manufacturer
recycling model is better than the platform recycling model for the manufacturer and
the platform, and the supply chain achieves coordination. From Propositions 8 and 9,
it is clear that the use of blockchain technology enables supply chain coordination from
an economic perspective. That is, when the fixed cost of blockchain self-construction
α∆
(
a + αε2∆
2ku
)
< F < α∆a + (∆ε)2
ku
[
1
2 − (1− α)α
]
, the manufacturer and the platform will
both gain more benefits when the manufacturer chooses the manufacturer recycling model.
We analyze how blockchain technology affects consumer surplus and social welfare
from a social perspective. We first analyze by comparing consumer surplus and social
welfare under two recycling models without blockchain technology.
Proposition 10. From the consumer surplus and social welfare in Propositions 1 and 2, it is clear
that the consumer surplus in the manufacturer recycling model and in the platform recycling model
are equal when blockchain technology is not used. The comparison of social welfare under the
two recycling models, SWNM − SWNP = (ε∆ξ)2(1−α)2
2rku
> 0, indicates that social welfare under
the manufacturer recycling model is superior to that under the platform recycling model when
blockchain technology is not used.
Secondly, we compare consumer surplus and social welfare in the two recycling
models using blockchain technology, resulting in Proposition 11, as follows.
Proposition 11. The social welfare under the manufacturer recycling model is always better
than that under the platform recycling model, regardless of whether blockchain technology is used.
Consumer surplus under blockchain empowerment is better than that without blockchain technology.
From the consumer surplus and social welfare in Propositions 3 and 4, it is clear
that the consumer surplus in the manufacturer recycling model and that in the platform
recycling model are equal when using blockchain technology. The comparison of social
welfare under the two recycling models, SWBM − SWBP = (∆ε)2
2rku
(1− α)2 > 0, found that
the social welfare under the manufacturer recycling model is always better than that under
the platform recycling model when using the blockchain. Combining Proposition 10, an
analysis comparing social welfare under the two models without blockchain technology, we
conclude that social welfare under the manufacturer recycling model is always better than
that under the platform recycling model, regardless of whether blockchain technology is
used. For the longitudinal comparison, i.e., the impact of whether or not to use blockchain
on the social welfare of the manufacturer recycling model and the platform recycling model,
respectively, we assign values to them in the numerical algorithm in Section 6 and then
compare them analytically.
To sum up, we find that consumer surplus in the manufacturer recycling model is the
same as that in platform recycling model regardless of whether blockchain technology is
used. Not only is the consumer surplus the same, but we can see from Propositions 1, 2,
3, and 4 that the wholesale price of electronics, the retail price, and the marketing effort
Sustainability 2022, 14, 6136 19 of 44
of the platform are the same for both recycling models, meaning that the optimal pricing
of electronics and the marketing strategy of the platform are independent of the recycling
model is chosen. Therefore, we use the superscript B to denote the consumer surplus under
both recycling models when using blockchain technology and the superscript N to denote
the consumer surplus under both recycling models when not using blockchain technology,
and then analyze and compare the effect of blockchain technology on the consumer surplus
again, finding that CSB − CSN > 0, that is to say, the consumer surplus with blockchain
technology is better than that without blockchain technology.
Proposition 12. Considering the impact of a relevant parameter on brand goodwill, retail and
wholesale prices of electronics, marketing efforts of the platform, and recycling efforts of the recycler,
this paper analyzes the key parameters in the manufacturer recycling model and the platform
recycling model in both cases with and without the use of blockchain technology, as shown in Table 5.
Since the wholesale price, retail price, marketing effort of the platform, and brand
goodwill of the electronics are independent of which recycling model is used, we directly
use wN
∞, pN
∞, sN
∞, GN
∞ to denote the wholesale price, retail price, marketing effort of the
platform, and brand goodwill, respectively, when blockchain technology is not used, and
use wB
∞, pB
∞, sB
∞, GB
∞ to denote them when blockchain technology is used, respectively.

As can be seen from the above table, brand goodwill GN/B
∞ , retail price pN/B
∞ , wholesale
price wN/B
∞ , and marketing effort sN/B
∞ under the two recycling models with or without
blockchain technology increase with the increase in the influence coefficient θ of goodwill
on basic market demand, platform power λ, and the influence coefficient ρ of marketing
effort input on brand goodwill. All decrease with the increase in the coefficient of platform
marketing cost ks, price sensitivity β of consumers, the discount rate r, and the coefficient
of the decay of brand goodwill δ. In the absence of blockchain technology, if the real
recycling ξ is increased, the impact of the false recycling rate on the brand goodwill of
the product will be reduced, thus improving the brand goodwill of the product. Based
on the expressions for each control variable that we derived in Sections 4 and 5, we can
find that the wholesale price of the product, the retail price, the marketing effort, and
the recycling effort of the platform in both recycling model strategies increase as the real
recycling rate increases.
In the platform recycling model, the platform delivers the recovered electronics to the
manufacturer, and gains a share of the residual value of α. The higher the share ratio is,
the more the platform will invest in recycling efforts and increase the recycling amount,
Sustainability 2022, 14, 6136 20 of 44
thus increasing the total profit of the platform. In other words, in the platform recycling
model, regardless of whether blockchain technology is adopted, the platform’s recycling
effort will increase with the increase in the residual value ratio α. We also find that the
recycling effort in both recycling models increases with the marginal residual value ∆ of
the recycled scrap product and the coefficient ε of the impact of the recycling effort on
the amount of waste electronics recycled, and decreases with the increase in the recycling
effort cost coefficient ku, regardless of whether blockchain technology is used. It is easy
to explain that, when the cost coefficient of recycling effort increases, the recycler will
certainly reduce the recycling effort accordingly unless there is sufficient funding available
to support it. When the marginal residual value of waste electronics increases, it will
directly improve the profit of the recycler, therefore the recycler will continue to increase
the recycling efforts to improve the recycling amount. When the coefficient of the impact
of the input of recycling effort on the amount of waste electronics recovered increases,
the improvement of recycling efforts will directly increase the recycling amount of waste
electronics, improve the total residual value, and thus improve the profit of the recycler,
which is in line with practical significance.
6. Numerical Analysis
In this section, we perform numerical analysis to gain more management insights by
examining the following questions:
(1) The effect of the change in the share ratio α on the growth rate of recycling rate, the
growth rate of supply chain profit, and the growth rate of social welfare;
(2) The impact of the ratio of real to theoretical recycling volume on profit of manufacturer,
platform and supply chain, and social welfare under two recycling models;
(3) The impact of platform power on profit of manufacturer, platform and supply chain,
and social welfare under two recycling models;
(4) Proposition 7 shows that, when F < B, both the manufacturer and the platform prefer
to use blockchain technology in both recycling models. Proposition 9 shows that, when
the self-built cost of the blockchain is α∆
(
a + αε2∆
2ku
)
< F < α∆a+ (∆ε)2
ku
[

,
the manufacturer chooses the manufacturer recycling model and the platform can
also gain more revenue from it. Then, whether there is an intersection between the
two, both the manufacturer and the platform will choose the manufacturer recycling
model empowered by blockchain from their own interests. If so, what is the range of
F as well as α, and are the economic, environmental, and social aspects of choosing
the manufacturer recycling model enabled by blockchain better than other modes?
In this section, based on the actual situation, basic parameters are set as follows:
a = 0.2; ρ = 2; ks = 3; ku = 7; θ = 3.5; λ = 2; δ = 1.5; r = 0.1; ξ = 0.6; ∆ = 6;
ε = 0.8; β = 0.8
6.1. Brand Goodwill Time Trajectory Chart
The initial goodwill of the electronics brand is GH
0 = 2 and GL
0 = 0.1, respectively,
with α = 0.4 and F = 10. The time trajectory of product brand goodwill and the time
trajectory of product retail price under the four recycling models of manufacturer recycling
and platform recycling without blockchain empowerment, and manufacturer recycling and
platform recycling with blockchain empowerment, are shown below.
As can be seen from Figure 1, the time trajectory of brand goodwill under the four
recycling models has nothing to do with the initial goodwill. A higher initial goodwill will
decay with an increase in time, while a lower initial goodwill will improve with an increase
in time; however, both will eventually converge to a steady state. Brand goodwill in both
recycling models is the same regardless of whether blockchain is used, though brand
goodwill with blockchain enabled is higher than that without blockchain. When brand
goodwill is high, that is, in the recycling model enabled by blockchain, consumer market
demand and the wholesale and retail prices of products are increased, and the profits of
Sustainability 2022, 14, 6136 21 of 44
the manufacturer and the platform are also increased. However, the use of blockchain
technology leads to a double marginalization effect. The retail price of electronic products
changes with the change of goodwill, thus the time trajectory of the retail price of products
under the four recycling models in Figure 2 is similar to that in Figure 1.

6.2. Influence of the Ratio of Real to Theoretical Recycling (Real Recycling Rate) on Profits of 
Supply Chain Participants and Supply Chain, and Social Welfare 
In the absence of blockchain empowerment, we conduct a comparative analysis of 
the impact of the true recycling rates on manufacturer profits, platform profits, supply 
chain profit, and social welfare under the two recycling models. The supply chain profit 
is the sum of manufacturer profit and platform profit, and the supply chain profit under 
the manufacturer and the platform recycling model, are 
NM NM
M PSNM V V = +  and 
NP NP
M PSNP V V = + . 
From Figures 3–5, it can be clearly seen that the real recycling rate has a positive im-
pact on profits of the manufacturer, the platform and overall supply chain, and social wel-
fare under the two recycling models. With the gradual increase in the real recycling rate, 
it has a greater impact on supply chain profits and social welfare in the manufacturer 
recycling model than in the platform recycling model. As can be seen from Figure 3, the 
effect of the real recycling rate on the manufacturer’s profit and platform profit under two 
recycling models is that the manufacturer’s profit under the manufacturer’s recycling 
model is greater than the platform profit under the platform recycling model, and greater 
than the manufacturer’s profit under the platform recycling model and greater than the 
platform profit under the manufacturer recycling model. As can be seen from Table 5, 
with an increase in the real recycling rate, the wholesale price, retail price, brand goodwill 
and recycling efforts of the recycler all increase accordingly. The increase in recycling ef-
forts increases the recycling amount of reverse waste electronic products. Moreover, an 
increase in the real recycling rate will increase the total residual value of waste electronic 
products. Therefore, under the influence of the above factors, regarding the manufac-
turer’s mode recycling, the manufacturer’s profit will increase more with an increase in 
the real recycling rate, and the residual value of the waste products’ recycling all belong 
to the manufacturer; the profit of the platform will not be affected by the residual value, 
therefore the real recycling rate has a smaller image of the platform profit under the man-
ufacturer recycling model. In the platform recycling model, the manufacturer signs a

In the absence of blockchain empowerment, we conduct a comparative analysis of 
the impact of the true recycling rates on manufacturer profits, platform profits, supply

it has a greater impact on supply chain profits and social welfare in the manufacturer

model is greater than the platform profit under the platform recycling model, and greater 
than the manufacturer’s profit under the platform recycling model and greater than the

with an increase in the real recycling rate, the wholesale price, retail price, brand goodwill

6.2. Influence of the Ratio of Real to Theoretical Recycling (Real Recycling Rate) on Profits of
Supply Chain Participants and Supply Chain, and Social Welfare
In the absence of blockchain empowerment, we conduct a comparative analysis of the
impact of the true recycling rates on manufacturer profits, platform profits, supply chain
profit, and social welfare under the two recycling models. The supply chain profit is the sum
of manufacturer profit and platform profit, and the supply chain profit under the manufac-
turer and the platform recycling model, are SNM = VNM
M∞ + VNM
P∞ and SNP = VNP
M∞ + VNP
P∞ .
From Figures 3–5, it can be clearly seen that the real recycling rate has a positive
impact on profits of the manufacturer, the platform and overall supply chain, and social
welfare under the two recycling models. With the gradual increase in the real recycling
rate, it has a greater impact on supply chain profits and social welfare in the manufacturer
recycling model than in the platform recycling model. As can be seen from Figure 3, the
effect of the real recycling rate on the manufacturer’s profit and platform profit under
two recycling models is that the manufacturer’s profit under the manufacturer’s recycling
model is greater than the platform profit under the platform recycling model, and greater
than the manufacturer’s profit under the platform recycling model and greater than the
platform profit under the manufacturer recycling model. As can be seen from Table 5, with
an increase in the real recycling rate, the wholesale price, retail price, brand goodwill and
recycling efforts of the recycler all increase accordingly. The increase in recycling efforts
increases the recycling amount of reverse waste electronic products. Moreover, an increase
in the real recycling rate will increase the total residual value of waste electronic products.
Therefore, under the influence of the above factors, regarding the manufacturer’s mode
recycling, the manufacturer’s profit will increase more with an increase in the real recycling
rate, and the residual value of the waste products’ recycling all belong to the manufacturer;
the profit of the platform will not be affected by the residual value, therefore the real
recycling rate has a smaller image of the platform profit under the manufacturer recycling

model. In the platform recycling model, the manufacturer signs a revenue-sharing contract
with the platform for the residual value of waste electronics, therefore the platform will
have a residual value share ratio of α. Therefore, as the real recycling rate increases, its
impact on the platform profit under the platform recycling model is greater than that under
the manufacturer recycling model.

revenue-sharing contract with the platform for the residual value of waste electronics, 
therefore the platform will have a residual value share ratio of  . Therefore, as the real 
recycling rate increases, its impact on the platform profit under the platform recycling 
model is greater than that under the manufacturer recycling model.

A comparative analysis of the impact of platform power on manufacturer profit, plat-
form profit, supply chain profit, and on social welfare under two recycling models.

the impact of platform power on platform profit is positively and identically correlated in 
both recycling models, that is, ,NM NP BM BP

6.4. Impact of Residual Value Share Ratio and Blockchain Fixed Cost of Waste Electronics on

From Proposition 9, when the fixed cost of the blockchain satisfies a certain range, 
the benefits of both the manufacturer and the platform will be better than the platform 
recycling model when the manufacturer chooses the manufacturer recycling model. The 
impact of the residual value share ratio and blockchain fixed cost on the choice of recycling

spective of the manufacturer and the platform, as shown in Figures 6–9. 
From Figure 9, it can be seen that, when the residual value share ratio ( )0.34,0.98
, the manufacturer chooses the manufacturer recycling model in the case of using block-
chain, and the platform will also gain more revenue from it. Region I and Region II are 
the ranges from which the platform can also gain more revenue when the manufacturer 
chooses the manufacturer recycling model. However, with a residual value share ratio of 
almost 1, why does the platform still obtain more from the manufacturer recycling model?

Figure 9. Optimal recycling model selection from an economic perspective under blockchain em-

This is easy to explain. We can see clearly in the figure above that, when the share 
ratio   reaches a maximum value of 0.98, the fixed cost of self-built blockchain technol-
ogy is also high. The cost of introducing a blockchain technology alone is expensive, and 
even if all the residual value of the waste electronics goes to the platform, it may not offset 
the cost of the self-built blockchain. Region I and Region III are the range of conditions for 
the manufacturer to choose the manufacturer recycling model based on their maximiza-
tion of benefits. When the share ratio and the fixed cost of blockchain are in Region I, both 
the manufacturer and the platform will prefer the blockchain-enabled manufacturer recy-
cling model. 
Figure 10 reflects the impact of the residual share ratio and blockchain fixed cost on 
the choice of recycling model from a social perspective when using blockchain technology. 
  
Figure 9. Optimal recycling model selection from an economic perspective under blockchain
empowerment.
From Figure 9, it can be seen that, when the residual value share ratio α ∈ (0.34, 0.98),
the manufacturer chooses the manufacturer recycling model in the case of using blockchain,
and the platform will also gain more revenue from it. Region I and Region II are the ranges
from which the platform can also gain more revenue when the manufacturer chooses the
manufacturer recycling model. However, with a residual value share ratio of almost 1, why
does the platform still obtain more from the manufacturer recycling model?
This is easy to explain. We can see clearly in the figure above that, when the share ratio
α reaches a maximum value of 0.98, the fixed cost of self-built blockchain technology is also
high. The cost of introducing a blockchain technology alone is expensive, and even if all the
residual value of the waste electronics goes to the platform, it may not offset the cost of the
self-built blockchain. Region I and Region III are the range of conditions for the manufac-
turer to choose the manufacturer recycling model based on their maximization of benefits.
When the share ratio and the fixed cost of blockchain are in Region I, both the manufacturer
and the platform will prefer the blockchain-enabled manufacturer recycling model.
Figure 10 reflects the impact of the residual share ratio and blockchain fixed cost on
the choice of recycling model from a social perspective when using blockchain technology.
From Figure 10, when the share ratio and the fixed cost of blockchain are within
Region I, the social welfare under blockchain empowerment is superior to that without
the use of blockchain technology in the platform recycling model. In the manufacturer
recycling model, social welfare is better with blockchain technology than without it when
the share ratio and the fixed cost of blockchain are within Region I and Region II. It can
be clearly seen that, within Region I, the social welfare with blockchain empowerment is
better than that without blockchain technology in both the manufacturer and platform
recycling models. This is also the result of the longitudinal comparison of the impact of
using or not using blockchain on the social welfare in the manufacturer recycling model
and the platform recycling model, respectively, in Section 5. However, in Region III,
manufacturers and platforms are not inclined to use blockchain technology due to the high
fixed cost of blockchain. As seen in Proposition 11, the manufacturer recycling model is
superior to the platform recycling model from a social welfare perspective, regardless of
Sustainability 2022, 14, 6136 25 of 44
whether blockchain technology is used. Therefore, we conclude that the use of blockchain
technology and the choice of the manufacturer recycling model is superior in terms of
social welfare when the share ratio and the fixed cost of blockchain are within Region I. In
Region III, it is preferable not to use blockchain technology and to choose the manufacturer
recycling model.

Figure 10. Optimal recycling model selection from a social perspective under blockchain empower-
ment. 
From Figure 10, when the share ratio and the fixed cost of blockchain are within Re-
gion I, the social welfare under blockchain empowerment is superior to that without the 
use of blockchain technology in the platform recycling model. In the manufacturer recy-
cling model, social welfare is better with blockchain technology than without it when the 
share ratio and the fixed cost of blockchain are within Region I and Region II. It can be 
clearly seen that, within Region I, the social welfare with blockchain empowerment is bet-
ter than that without blockchain technology in both the manufacturer and platform recy-
cling models. This is also the result of the longitudinal comparison of the impact of using 
or not using blockchain on the social welfare in the manufacturer recycling model and the 
platform recycling model, respectively, in Section 5. However, in Region III, manufactur-
ers and platforms are not inclined to use blockchain technology due to the high fixed cost 
of blockchain. As seen in Proposition 11, the manufacturer recycling model is superior to 
the platform recycling model from a social welfare perspective, regardless of whether 
blockchain technology is used. Therefore, we conclude that the use of blockchain technol-
ogy and the choice of the manufacturer recycling model is superior in terms of social wel-
fare when the share ratio and the fixed cost of blockchain are within Region I. In Region 
III, it is preferable not to use blockchain technology and to choose the manufacturer recy-
cling model. 
Make the share ratio of the residual value 0.4 =  to compare the impact of the block-
chain technology on the recycling rate in different recycling models. 
As shown in Table 6, the recycling rate is higher when using blockchain technology 
than when not using it, regardless of whether the manufacturer recycles or the platform 
recycles. When using blockchain technology, the manufacturer recycling model has a 
higher recycling rate than the platform recycling model. Therefore, from the perspective 
of the recycling rate (environment), it is optimal to choose the manufacturer recycling 
model under blockchain empowerment.

As can be seen from Figure 11, Region I, Region II, and Feasible Region are preferable 
from the perspective of social welfare to use blockchain technology and select the manu-
facturer recycling model. From a manufacturer and platform profit (economic) point of 
view, it is preferable to choose a manufacturer recycling model within the Feasible Region. 
It is found that, when the share ratio and the fixed cost of blockchain are within the Fea-
sible Region, the introduction of blockchain technology and the choice of manufacturer 
recycling model are better for economic, social, and environmental benefits compared to 
the choice of other models. In other scopes and other recycling models, the common im-

In the platform recycling model empowered by block chain, the influence of changes 
in the revenue sharing coefficient on supply chain profit growth rate (economy), recycling 
growth rate (environment), and social welfare growth rate (society) is further analyzed, 
as shown in Table 7.

As seen in Table 7, the supply chain profit growth rate (economic), social welfare
growth rate (social), and recycling rate growth rate (environmental) all increase as the
share ratio increases. When α ∈ [0, 0.3], the growth rate of the three types of benefits have
been increasing, although it is negative. Moreover, it can be seen from Figure 11 that,
when α ∈ (0.34, 0.98), the choice of manufacturer recycling model is optimal from both
economic and social perspectives. In the above table, the growth rate of the triple benefits
is positive when α ∈ [0.4, 0.9], which means that it is better with blockchain technology
than without it. This reinforces our conclusion above that economic, environmental, and
societal improvement can be achieved when α and F are within the Feasible Region in
Figure 11 through the introduction of blockchain technology and the choice of manufacturer
recycling model.
7. Extension with Unit Cost of Blockchain
In the main model, we explored how blockchain technology affects the choice of
recycling model from the perspective of the triple benefits, and concluded that, when α and
F are within the Feasible Region in Figure 11, the introduction of blockchain technology
and the choice of the manufacturer recycling model can result in better economic, social,
and environmental outcomes. In this section, we consider another form of introducing
blockchain technology, assuming that the recycler partners with a third party to rent the
blockchain technology, that is, for each use of the blockchain technology, the recycler pays
a fee b to the third party (the owner of the blockchain technology), b being the unit cost of
using the blockchain technology. In this case, we will only discuss manufacturer recycling
and platform recycling when using blockchain technology.
The Stackelberg differential game model for the choice of two recycling models by the
manufacturer and the platform to maximize their respective interests is as follows.

In both recycling models, the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equations are con-
structed for the platform and the manufacturer successively, and their marketing strategies
and recycling effort strategies satisfy the respective HJB equations. The equilibrium solution

It can be found that the balance strategy of wholesale price, retail price, and marketing
effort of the platform remains unchanged when renting blockchain technology from a
third party compared with self-built blockchain technology. The only difference is that the
recycling effort is reduced in both recycling models.
We still make a = 0.2; ρ = 2; ks = 3; ku = 7; θ = 3.5; λ = 2; δ = 1.5; r = 0.1; ∆ = 6;
ε = 0.8; β = 0.8 to analyze the influence of the unit cost b of the blockchain on the choice of
recycling model when using blockchain technology.
As shown in Figure 12, the range of the residual value share ratio of waste electronics
is the same as in Section 6, which is unchanged. When the unit cost of using blockchain
lies within Region (P), it is better for the manufacturer to choose the platform recycling
model than the manufacturer recycling model; however, when the manufacturer chooses
the platform recycling, the cost of the platform using blockchain technology is greater
than the residual value, therefore this range is not desirable. When the unit cost of using
the blockchain is within Region M, the manufacturer chooses the manufacturer recycling
model. In Figure 13, we can see that the platform prefers the manufacturer recycling model
when the residual value share ratio and the unit cost of the blockchain are within Region M.
From the perspective of maximizing platform profits, the platform will prefer the platform
recycling model only when the residual value sharing ratio and unit cost of blockchain
are within Region P, under the condition that the recycling effort of the recycler is positive.
When b lies within Region (P), that is, when the manufacturer chooses the platform to
recycle, the platform will gain more revenue; however, within this range, the cost of using
blockchain technology is greater than the residual value, and the platform will not use the
blockchain to recycle, therefore it is contradictory in Region (P) region.

Figure 14. Impact of unit cost of blockchain on recycling model selection. 
Within Region IV, both the manufacturer and the platform will prefer the platform 
model recycling; however, when choosing the platform recycling model, it is necessary to 
ensure that the unit residual value obtained by the platform is greater than the unit cost 
of the blockchain, namely, b  , therefore it is undesirable within Region IV. Moreover, 
all the ranges on the right side of restriction b =  are undesirable when choosing the 
platform recycling model, that is, within Region III, Region IV, and Region (I). 
In this case, essentially the same trade-offs as in the main model can be found. When 
the cost of using blockchain technology is between two thresholds, the optimal decision 
for the manufacturer and the platform can be unified, that is, the blockchain-enabled man-
ufacturer recycling model. That said, the same conclusions we draw apply when replacing 
the self-constructed cost of using blockchain technology with the unit cost of working with 
a third party.

The final discussion and conclusions mainly highlight the contributions related to the 
study results. This study has important implications for the sustainability of platform-
based, closed-loop supply chains, especially for companies in the electronics category that 
can better develop recycling strategies to increase environmental benefits and play an im-
portant role in promoting long-term sustainable development. 
8.1. Discussion 
The main objective of this paper is to explore how electronics manufacturers can de-
velop recycling strategies and consider the inclusion of online platforms as recyclers and 
consider the recycling function of platforms on the basis of platform resell. Therefore, the 
impact of blockchain technology on the selection of recycling models for electronics man-
ufacturers is considered on the basis of a platform-based, closed-loop supply chain. 
It is different from the static game of enterprises considering immediate interests 
found in previous studies. With the help of differential game theory and Bellman’s con-
tinuous dynamic programming method, this paper explores the optimal operational de-
cisions of enterprises with the goal of long-term profits and integrates the impact of cur-
rent decisions on current profits and future performance, which is more in line with the 
actual decision-making environment of enterprises. 
In addition, we have innovated the recycling model. Most of the research on recycling 
models are about offline recycling, with recycling channels focused on manufacturers, re-
tailers, and third parties [17–23]. We further considered the online platform as a recycling 
channel and added blockchain technology to the recycling process. The use of blockchain 
technology can not only expand the market scale in the forward sales process, but also

technology can not only expand the market scale in the forward sales process, but also
increase the actual recycling amount in the reverse recycling process, which has a positive
impact on the whole closed-loop supply chain process.
8.2. Conclusions
This paper studies the selection of recycling models for waste electronics in a platform-
based, closed-loop supply chain empowered by blockchain. Specifically, we considered
a dynamic closed-loop supply chain consisting of an electronics manufacturer and an
online platform. In the forward selling process, electronics manufacturers resell their
products through the platform. In the reverse recycling process, manufacturers can either
recycle by themselves or use online platforms to recycle waste electronics. In this paper,
we study the strategies of four recycling models, namely, the manufacturer recycling
model (NM) and platform recycling model (NP) without blockchain technology, and the
manufacturer recycling model (BM) and platform recycling model (BP) with blockchain
enabled. This paper focuses on the impact of blockchain technology on the selection of
recycling models for waste electronics from the perspective of profit maximization for the
manufacturer and the platform. Next, we analyze the consumer surplus and social welfare
under each recycling model, and further consider the possibility that blockchain technology
can improve the “triple benefits”. Finally, the model for unit cost used by blockchain
technology is expanded and several main findings are made.
We found that blockchain technology can solve the challenge of uncoordinated supply
chain in the reverse recycling process. In the absence of the introduction of blockchain
technology, the manufacturers prefer to recycle waste electronics themselves, however the
platform cannot gain more revenue from it and the supply chain is difficult to coordinate.
The introduction of blockchain technology can effectively solve this problem. When the
fixed cost of the blockchain and the share ratio of the residual value of waste electronics are
between two thresholds, both the manufacturer and the platform prefer the manufacturer
Sustainability 2022, 14, 6136 30 of 44
to recycle the waste electronics. This means that both receive more out of it and the supply
chain is coordinated.
The blockchain-enabled manufacturer recycling model can improve profits for partici-
pants in the supply chain. Blockchain technology makes the reverse recycling process of
the closed-loop supply chain more transparent and easier to supervise, therefore the true
recycling rate of waste electronics can be significantly improved. When the real recycling
rate increases, the total residual value of waste products will also increase. Therefore,
the recycler will increase the investment in recycling efforts, thus improving the recycling
amount of waste electronics and further increasing the profit of the recycler. However, using
blockchain technology by the recycler is not a small expense. For platforms, when the fixed
cost of the blockchain is too high, the higher residual value share will not offset the cost
of using blockchain technology for the platform. As a result, platforms will then abandon
the use of blockchain technology or abandon recycling. However, the use of blockchain
technology will increase the brand goodwill of the product and thus its profits, therefore the
platform continues to prefer blockchain technology. Moreover, for manufacturers, the use of
blockchain technology will also increase their profits. When the manufacturer recycles, all
of the residual value of the waste electronics goes to the manufacturer, thus making it more
profitable. Although the cost of using blockchain is higher, using blockchain technology
can be more profitable for manufacturers. In the numerical analysis, we concluded that, in
the problem of choosing the recycling model, when the ratio of the fixed cost of blockchain
technology and the share of the residual value of waste electronics is in a certain interval,
the model in which both the manufacturer and the platform can gain more revenue is the
blockchain-enabled manufacturer recycling model. Moreover, the same applies when the
fixed cost of a blockchain input becomes a marginal cost of use.
The blockchain-enabled manufacturer recycling model can achieve economic, envi-
ronmental, and social “triple benefits”. This means that, in this model, the profit of supply
chain, the recycling rate of waste electronics, and social welfare are significantly improved.
Specifically, blockchain technology can improve the real recycling rate of waste electronics,
so that all recycled products can be truly and effectively recycled, thus increasing the real
recycling volume. Thus, the recycling rate is higher with blockchain than it is without
blockchain. Blockchain technology further improves the consumer trust effect by increasing
the amount of real recycling and reduces the impact of false recycling rates on goodwill,
thus improving the brand goodwill of electronic products. When the brand goodwill of a
product increases, the retail and wholesale prices of electronics also increase, which leads
to a double marginal effect and indirectly affects the demand in the consumer market.
However, the use of blockchain technology will also increase consumer surplus, and the
increased consumer surplus will compensate for the loss due to the double marginal ef-
fect. Moreover, as the profits of supply chain increase with blockchain empowerment,
social welfare increases as well. Based on the numerical analysis, we obtain an interesting
finding that the recycling rate and social welfare are always higher in the manufacturer
recycling model than in the platform recycling model. Therefore, we conclude that, in the
closed-loop supply chain, the blockchain-enabled recycling model for manufacturers can
achieve the improvement of the “triple benefits”. The numerical analysis also verifies our
conclusion that, in the problem of the selection of a recycling model, when the fixed cost of
blockchain and the share ratio of the residual value of waste electronics are between two
thresholds, the condition to meet the common improvement of the “triple benefit” is the
blockchain-enabled manufacturer recycling model.
This paper highlights the important role of blockchain technology for the recycling of
waste electronics. It considers the recycling function of the platform on the basis of platform
resell and analyzes the impact of blockchain technology on the selection of recycling model
(manufacturer recycling/platform recycling) for waste electronics in a platform-based,
closed-loop supply chain, filling in this aspect of the study and providing some valuable
management insights for relevant enterprises and personnel, as follows.
Sustainability 2022, 14, 6136 31 of 44
For electronics manufacturers, the recycling of waste electronics will reduce the waste
of resources and environmental pollution and other conditions, which is the specific
performance of enterprises to fulfill their social responsibility. It has a high economic and
social value and plays an important role in promoting long-term sustainable development.
Blockchain technology can make the whole process of the supply chain more transparent
through its visibility and traceability features. Manufacturers can leverage blockchain
technology in the process of reverse recycling electronics for better regulation and recycling.
However, manufacturers have to consider its construction costs when using blockchain
technology to further achieve the improvement of “triple benefits” while increasing profits.
For online platforms, blockchain technology can increase the real recycling rate of
waste electronics, increase consumer trust, and reduce the impact of false recycling rates on
brand goodwill, thereby expanding the market scale. However, the platform only receives
a portion of the residual value of the recycled waste electronics, therefore it can barely make
up for the higher cost of blockchain self-construction. Therefore, in the closed-loop supply
chain using blockchain technology, the platform is not involved in the reverse recycling
process, and the platform will benefit from the manufacturer’s recycling. In the positive
sales process, the platform should give full play to its unique “platform power”, leveraging
the network effect of its own channels or adopting online marketing to expand the potential
demand of the consumer market, increase the sales volume of products, and increase the
profits of manufacturers and platforms.
In short, the research in this paper is based on a one-to-one, two-stage, platform-based,
closed-loop supply chain, and solves the problems of low recycling rates of waste electronics
and consumer trust with the help of the visibility and traceability of blockchain. This study
is also applicable to the recycling of waste products in other industries, which can solve
the problems of resource waste and environmental pollution and contribute to long-term
sustainable development. In the future, it can be considered to increase the competitive
relationship of supply chain members and expand the complex closed-loop supply chain
network system. In addition, the assumptions in this study are based on information
symmetry; however, in practice, enterprises tend to be more reluctant to disclose their
private information. Further research can consider how blockchain technology impacts
platform-based, closed-loop supply chains in the presence of information asymmetry.
The future research can consider the impact of using blockchain technology on forward
selling and reverse recycling processes when remanufactured products are unequal to
new products.
