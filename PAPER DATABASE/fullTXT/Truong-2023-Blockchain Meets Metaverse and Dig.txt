ABSTRACT Envisioned to be the next-generation Internet, the metaverse has been attracting enormous
attention from both the academia and industry. The metaverse can be viewed as a 3D immersive virtual
world, where people use Augmented/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) devices to access and interact with others
through digital avatars. While early versions of the metaverse exist in several Massively Multiplayer Online
(MMO) games, the full-flesh metaverse is expected to be more complex and enabled by various advanced
technologies. Blockchain is one of the crucial technologies that could revolutionize the metaverse to become
a decentralized and democratic virtual society with its own economic and governance system. Realizing the
importance of blockchain for the metaverse, our goal in this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey that
clarifies the role of blockchain in the metaverse including in-depth analysis of digital asset management.
To this end, we discuss how blockchain can enable the metaverse from different perspectives, ranging from
user applications to virtual services and the blockchain-enabled economic system. Furthermore, we describe
how blockchain can shape the metaverse from the system perspective, including various solutions for the
decentralized governance system and data management. The potential of blockchain for security and privacy
aspects of the metaverse infrastructure is also figured out, while a full flow of blockchain-based digital asset
management for the metaverse is investigated. Finally, we discuss a wide range of open challenges of the
blockchain-empowered metaverse.

I. INTRODUCTION
A. BACKGROUND
The term metaverse was first introduced by Neil Stephenson
in his science fiction novel Snow Crash written in 1992 [1],
where the metaverse was described as a virtual world running
parallel to the physical world. In particular, people immerse

themselves in the metaverse using VR devices and interact
with each other through their digital representation called
avatars. Thanks to the rapid development and invention of
various advanced technologies, the concept of metaverse is
re-emerging and has been envisioned as the next-generation
Internet. Specifically, while Digital Twin (DT) enables
seamless mapping between the digital and physical worlds,
the Augmented/Virtual Reality (AR/VR) technology allows
people to explore the 3D virtual world with immersive and

vivid experience [2]. The advancement of state-of-the-art
communication and networking technologies such as 5G-
and-beyond wireless networks is also a key driving force
for the metaverse as they provide ultra-high speed, low
latency and reliable data communications among metaverse
devices and between devices and the network [3]. Artificial
Intelligence (AI) offers efficient tools to create virtual
environment and digital items automatically as well as to
extract valuable knowledge from massive data generated in
the metaverse [4]. The metaverse is expected to revolutionize
various aspects of life such as education [5], healthcare [6],
entertainment [7], e-commerce [8], smart manufacturing and
other social services [9].
Many giant technology companies and organizations have
been investing heavily to make the metaverse a reality. In
2021 alone, Meta poured at least $10 billion into building the
metaverse [10]. Similarly, other tech giants like Microsoft,
Google, and Nvidia have also taken solid steps to advance
themetaverse with huge investments [11]. Existingmetaverse
projects and platforms such as Fornite,1 Roblox,2 and
Sandbox3 have been attracting great attention from the
entire society. However, these platforms are still far from
realizing the ultimate concept of themetaverse. They could be
considered as light versions of the metaverse which evolved
from Multiplayer Online (MMO) games.
In MMO games, users playing the games are typically
represented as in-game characters, which are similar to
the concept of avatar in the metaverse. The players could
also interact with each other and participate in various
virtual activities held by game publishers or even by the
players themselves. Even as these games integrate VR/AR
technology offering their players immersive 3D experience,
there are still several differences between them and the
full-flesh metaverse. Firstly, the games usually lack the
interoperability capability. While the metaverse is envisioned
to be a global virtual world in which people are not restricted
to any particular platform [2], current game-basedmetaverses
operate separately and could not connect to each other.
Secondly, to truly imitate and enable a virtual society,
the metaverse must not be controlled by any particular
organization [3]. The metaverse should be a decentralized
environment with its own democratic governance system in
which every participant has a voice instead of depending
entirely on a centralized party. Thirdly, it must maintain a
complete economic system, where the value of digital assets
is kept stable regardless of platforms, and they could be traded
conveniently within the virtual world via a digital version of
real-world fiat currencies [4]. If a particular organization has
all rights to generate or delete digital contents and virtual
currencies, the platform would lack the desirable fairness and
sustainability.

From the technical viewpoint, blockchain is a digital
distributed ledger that stores transactions and data in a
decentralized manner. Specifically, transactions submitted
by network nodes are bunched into blocks, then blocks
are linked together through a hash function to form a
chain. This chain is distributed throughout the network in
which each node stores a replica of it. Thanks to this
architecture, blockchain possesses outstanding properties
such as immutability, transparency, decentralization, and
security [12].
Cryptocurrency, an important derivation of blockchain
technology, is a potential use case in the metaverse’s
economic system. Furthermore, major key technologies
derived from blockchain such as smart contract, Non-
Fungible Token (NFT) [13], Decentralized Autonomous
Organization (DAO) [14], Decentralized Finance (DeFi) [15],
and Decentralized applications (dApps) [16] can be leveraged
to build the economic, financial, and governance systems in
themetaverse.Moreover, blockchain can be used as a resilient
decentralized data storage method, where various cross-chain
communication techniques could be employed to achieve
metaverse data interoperability [3].
Most blockchain-based applications in the metaverse are
related to certain types of digital assets. While cryptocur-
rency, NFT, virtual real estate, user avatar and user-generated
content (UGC) are obviously digital assets, one could argue
that any data generated and stored in the metaverse can
be considered as digital asset since they are commercially
valuable. Thus, while development of blockchain-based
metaverse applications is an important research direction,
detailed studies of blockchain-based digital asset manage-
ment are also necessary when it comes to the next-generation
metaverse. To this end, a comprehensive survey covering
most up-to-date use cases of blockchain for the metaverse
could provide researchers and developers necessary knowl-
edge and facilitate further research in this burgeoning field.
B. EXISTING SURVEYS
There were several recent surveys on metaverse and related
enabling technologies, and the list has been growing rapidly
over recent years. The authors in [17] conducted a survey of
blockchain-enabled networking for the metaverse. The paper
mostly focuses on intelligent networking for the metaverse,
whereas other use cases of blockchain such as data storage,
governance and financial applications are not investigated.
Two recent papers [4], [18] both presented the use of
blockchain combined with AI in the metaverse. They show
the importance of these two technologies and show how
they can be leveraged to create the virtual world in certain
aspects. However, they did not offer comprehensiveness in
terms of blockchain-based applications, while the included
use cases are mostly limited to introduction. The contribution
of blockchain to the metaverse is also illustrated in [3]
as one of edge-enabling technologies. The paper mostly
concentrates on use cases related to mobile edge computing
and communication networks, while deeper analysis on
VOLUME 11, 2023 26259

blockchain-based applications such as the governance system
were not carried out. The authors in [2] discussed the
metaverese in terms of security and privacy in which
blockchain is used in several use cases to ensure these
important properties. For example, blockchain can guarantee
security of cross-domain authentication and offer privacy-
preserving features. The study in [19] investigates a wide
range of applications of blockchain in social media platforms.
They found out that existing studies mainly focus on blocking
fake news and enhancing data privacy. However, the concept
of metaverse is not just limited to social media as it is
broader and involves more factors to be discussed. Similarly,
other metaverse surveys [6], [20], [21] mentioned blockchain
technology as one ofmetaverse technology enablers, but none
of them treats the blockchain technology thoroughly since
they focus on other technologies and aspects of themetaverse.
C. MOTIVATIONS AND CONTRIBUTIONS
Aiming to fill the existing gaps in the literature, our paper
provides comprehensive discussions on the role of blockchain
in the metaverse. Since both blockchain and metaverse are
under rapid development, we attempt to include the most up-
to-date blockchain-based applications that could be deployed
in the future metaverse. By discussing the potential of the
blockchain-enabled metaverse deeply and comprehensively,
our survey offers necessary guidelines for both developers
and researchers in exploring and developing these state-of-
the-art technologies. Specifically, the contributions of our
survey can be summarized as follows:
• Firstly, we provide readers with necessary background
of blockchain technology and the metaverse. Then,
we discuss the potential impacts and contributions of
blockchain to the metaverse.
• Secondly, we investigate a wide range of blockchain-
enabled use cases for the metaverse from the user
application perspective, including economic system,
entertainment, financial services, and social services.
• Thirdly, we describe the impacts of blockchain on
the metaverse from the system perspective, including
applications for the governance, reputation, identity
system, and data management.
• We discuss security and privacy of the metaverse
infrastructure with the corresponding countermeasures
based on existing works.
• Next, we conduct an in-depth technical analysis on
digital assets in the metaverse, and present a 8-stage
digital asset management workflow for the virtual world.
• Finally, we discuss open challenges in integrating
blockchain into the metaverse from both technical and
social angles.

II. BACKGROUND OF METAVERSE
The metaverse concept was first coined in the science fiction
book Snow Crash in 1992. In 2003, Second Life,4 which is
considered as the first metaverse platform, was introduced
and attracted enormous attention from both industry and
academia [23]. One of the most important breakthroughs
of Second Life compared to previous platforms is that it
allows users to create, own, and trade their virtual creations.
In the last several years, thanks to the development of AR/VR
technology and especially the introduction of blockchain
technology, the term metaverse has again emerged and trig-
gered huge attention from the society. While AR/VR enables
the immersive and embodied experience in the virtual world,
blockchain technology revolutionizes metaverse digital asset
management and provides necessary tools to address a wide
range of issues in the metaverse [4].
A. METAVERSE ARCHITECTURE
The metaverse is envisioned to be an immersive 3D virtual
world that reflects the physical world in various aspects such

as society, politics, culture, and economy [3]. In this digital
world, people can participate in different virtual activities
such as working, playing games, shopping, trading assets, and
even purchasing virtual lands. To take part in the metaverse,
users use wearable AR/VR devices and represent themselves
as a real-time digital avatar, reflecting their appearance with
a variety of facial expressions and gestures [22].
The general metaverse architecture is presented in Fig. 2,
consisting of four main elements which are metaverse
infrastructure, metaverse tools, the virtual world and virtual
life of participants.
1) METAVERSE INFRASTRUCTURE
The infrastructure of metaverse can be constructed based
on a wide range of physical IoT devices and sensors,
which help collecting real-world data and reflecting the
physical world into the virtual world. The huge amount
of collected data is then transmitted seamlessly through
advanced communications and networking systems support-
ing high speed, low latency, and reliable communications [3].
The networking infrastructure can consist of various ele-
ments such as satellite, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
communications, and especially 5G and beyond wireless
networks [2]. To efficiently handle and process the metaverse
data, an appropriate combination of computing technologies
such as cloud, edge, and end-user computing is crucial.
Besides, data storage is an important factor in the metaverse
infrastructure, and it could be facilitated by blockchain [4].
This technology provides various options for data storage,
including on-chain storage with consortium blockchains,
or off-chain storage on distributed database and file systems.
Blockchain offers many outstanding characteristics such as
immutability, transparency, and interoperability [12].
2) METAVERSE TOOLS
Different metaverse tools are needed for metaverse users to
interact with the virtual world. For instance, users participate
in and view the metaverse through AR/VR headsets or
glasses, while haptic gloves make them feel like they are
touching real 3D objects by providing haptic feedback when
touching objects in the virtual world [22]. On the other
hand, DT technology takes responsibility for mapping and
synchronizing between the digital world and physical world,
thus offering users immersive and vivid experience [24].
To boost user experience further, AI can be utilized to realize
many potential metaverse functions and applications [18]. For
example, when users look at an object or place through AR
glasses, the AI system could automatically detect and provide
information related to it. Besides, blockchain can contribute

to this process with smart contract, cryptocurrency, NFT, and
decentralized applications [3].
3) VIRTUAL WORLD AND VIRTUAL LIFE
With all necessary technologies, the digital environment is
created with digital assets, real estate, UGCs, and even its
own financial and governance systems [25]. Users participate
in the platform through their avatars, thereby involving
in a variety of activities and services such as education,
entertainment, and healthcare [2]. At the highest extent, the
metaverse could bring users an entire virtual ‘‘second life’’.
B. CHARACTERISTICS OF METAVERSE
In the following, we describe eight different characteristics of
the metaverse:
• Immersive: Far beyond the current 2D interaction
between users and computers, the metaverse must pro-
vide users with vivid and realistic experience so that they
could feel psychologically and emotionally immersed in
the virtual space [26]. Such immersive experience could
be achieved through a blend of visuals, sound, touch,
even temperature, and environment effects.
• Embodied: Users not merely look at the virtual world
and its 3D contents, they are inside of it as a character
with a unique and specific role [22]. Specifically, users
are represented by their 3D digital avatars and can
interact with each other in the metaverse.
• Global:Themetaversemust be a shared and global envi-
ronment where everyone can access freely, regardless of
their location or nationality.
• Persistent: The metaverse must always be available at
all times. It continues running in any circumstance, even
when users exit the platform.
• Decentralized: The metaverse must not be controlled
by a particular organization. It should be an open space
where users completely own their assets and have a voice
in any future direction of the platform.
• Interoperable: Each user have a specific identity across
platforms and can transfer digital assets across the
virtual world. Furthermore, the ultimate version of the
metaverse could even interact with the real world [2].
• Sustainable: The metaverse must have a complete
and stable economic system with its own medium of
exchanges and financial activities. All virtual contents
in the metaverse must retain their value in comparison
with the real world.
• Synchronized: The virtual world co-exists and syn-
chronizes with the physical world. Any changes in the
physical world can be reflected to the virtual world and
vice versa [24].
To achieve the ultimate vision of the metaverse with
all of the above characteristics, a wide range of advanced
technologies must be employed properly to build the
metaverse infrastructure, applications, and services. Most
existing metaverse projects still lack certains functions and
26262 VOLUME 11, 2023

characteristics, thus they could be considered as the light
versions of the metaverse.
C. TECHNOLOGIES BEHIND METAVERSE
In terms of technology, the metaverse is considered as the
next-generation and the 3D model of the Internet. It is a com-
prehensive fusion of various emerging technologies such as
VR/AR, Extended Reality (XR), DT, AI, Blockchain, 5G/6G
Wireless Networks, Internet of Things (IoT), cloud and edge
computing. These advanced technologies all contribute to the
metaverse in different ways, and they complement each other.
The general roles of these technologies can be presented as
follows:
• Interactivity Technologies (AR/VR/XR): These tech-
nologies are very crucial in enabling the immersive
characteristic of the metaverse. They allow users to
experience the metaverse visually through wearable
devices such as VR headsets and haptic gloves instead
of traditional devices like smart phones and laptops [22].
• Digital Twin: DT uses real world data to create digital
representations of physical objects [27]. It enables
the synchronized property of the metaverse [24], thus
allowing the co-existence of physical-virtual reality
where real-world objects can appear in the virtual world,
and any changes applied to these objects in the digital
world will be reflected into the real world [28].
• Artificial Intelligence: AI contributes to the metaverse
in different ways [4]. Firstly, it could empower other
metaverse technologies such as IoT, DT and blockchain,
thereby indirectly contributing to the metaverse [4].
Moreover, it can enable the automatic creation process
such as creating vivid digital avatars through learning
user emotions and facial expressions. AI can also be
utilized to develop various virtual smart services such
as smart NPCs (non-player character), automatic trans-
lation, and recommendation systems in the metaverse.
• Internet of Things: IoT with numerous sensors and
cameras connecting together provides a massive source
of data for the metaverse. It facilitates digital twin in the
process of mapping the physical world into the virtual
world and vice versa [29], [30].
• Cloud and Edge Computing: While wearable devices
often have limited processing power and storage capac-
ity, the servers running the metaverse applications and
functions could also be overloaded due to the massive
number of users participating in the platform. Therefore,
proper combination and utilization of advanced cloud
and edge computing is crucial in processing the tremen-
dous amount of data in the metaverse while delivering
the required quality of service [3].
• Communication and Networking Technologies:With
massive data generated from an enormous number of
users around the world and their virtual activities,
a fast and ultra-reliable network infrastructure is cru-
cial [3]. Furthermore, state-of-the-art communication
technologies can be leveraged for low latency and high
speed communications to prevent motion sickness from
using VR devices, thus providing users the highest sense
of user experience and improving social acceptance to
the metaverse [17].
• Blockchain: Blockchain is the key technology which
enables the decentralized and sustainable characteristics
of the metaverse. It can help creating the economic
system of the metaverse with NFT, cryptocurrency
and DeFi [25]. In terms of metaverse infrastructure,
blockchain offers reliable data management and decen-
tralized systems for various applications.
The development and maturity of aforementioned tech-
nologies are the prerequisites for the formation of a complete
metaverse in the future. Currently, most metaverse platforms
are still incomplete versions of the metaverse [3]. However,
these light-version metaverses all seem to point towards
the ultimate concept of the metaverse and would gradually
converge at some point in the future, when technologies are
more mature in both software and hardware.
D. METAVERSE APPLICATIONS
Several prominent applications of the metaverse are
described in the following:
• Education: The metaverse could provide students
immersive learning experience with visual graphics
thanks to AR/VR technology. Students can interact
efficiently with their teachers through digital avatars.
Furthermore, DT enables practically learning with real-
time 3D models in the metaverse.
• Business: The metaverse could revolutionize sales and
marketing sectors with virtual stores built on metaverse
real estate. Besides, virtual factories in the metaverse
could enhance the productivity for businesses, while
digital workplaces offer convenient communication
between staff.
• Entertainment: Themetaverse can be considered as the
future of the entertainment industry. It offers immersive
play-to-earn games, provides unlimited spaces for
virtual concerts, virtual reality theme parks [31] and
exhibitions.
• Healthcare: The metaverse with virtual reality and DT
technologies could revolutionize the surgical practice
and medical training for the healthcare sector [6].
Moreover, medical records could be managed by
blockchain-based solutions within the metaverse plat-
form to ensure security and integrity.
• Social Services: Besides education and healthcare, the
metaverse could revolutionize both social and com-
mercial insurance sectors by leveraging the blockchain
technology for transparent document storage. It also
offers social service management and various types of
financial services in a decentralized manner.
There could be more metaverse applications emerging
during its development. Within the scope of the paper,

FIGURE 3. The general structure of a blockchain. The Merkle tree allows
users to verify payments quickly without having to download the entire
transaction history [33]. The block header actually often contains more
fields, depending on particular blockchain.
we concentrate more on applications enabled by blockchain
technology and its derivative mechanisms.
III. BACKGROUND OF BLOCKCHAIN
A. BLOCKCHAIN STRUCTURE AND PROPERTIES
Blockchain, as its name suggested, is a chain of consecutive
blocks linked together. Each block includes two parts, which
are block header and block body. In general, the body
of a block contains a certain amount of data. If these
data are financial transactions (e.g., sending cryptocurrency
from one node to another node), the blockchain can be
considered as a ledger, while the native currency being traded
is called cryptocurrency. That is why blockchain technology
sometimes referred to as Distributed Ledger technology.
On the other hand, the block header often contains at least
three fields. The first one is the Merkle root, which is the
root hash of the Merkle tree whose leaves are all transactions
in the body of the block [32]. The second field is the
hash of the previous block’s header, while the third one
is the time stamp, which estimates the time when a block
is created. This general blockchain structure is shown in
Fig. 3.
With this structure, if any transaction of a block is
modified, the Merkle root of that block will be changed
completely due to the collision-free characteristic of the
hash function. Therefore, the hash of that block’s header is
also changed, breaking the link between that block and its
next block [32]. This offers the first feature of blockchain
technology, tamper-proof, meaning that any tampering on
the blockchain can be detected easily by comparing block
hashes between every pair of consecutive blocks. Besides,
since every block includes a time stamp field indicating
its creation time, we could track the creation time of any
transactions inside it. This presents the second characteristic,
traceability, meaning that we can always keep track of any
data in a blockchain over time by accessing the chain’s
history.
Furthermore, a public blockchain is usually distributed
throughout a large peer-to-peer decentralized network with
numerous nodes, where each node keeps a replica of the
chain. Therefore, it possesses the next characteristic, trans-
parency, meaning that all data on the blockchain is transparent
to the public as everyone can download a replica of it at any
time. This implies that if a node unilaterally modifies data
on her blockchain, the change is only applicable to her local
chain and it will not impact on the rest of the network. This
upgrades the tamper-proof feature of blockchain to a higher
level of security, immutability, meaning that no one can
unilaterally make changes to the global blockchain, including
adding/removing blocks or modifying data on any block.
To add new valid data to the chain, blockchain consensus
algorithms are used.
B. BLOCKCHAIN CONSENSUS ALGORITHM
A crucial mechanism is needed to ensure only valid blocks
(i.e., blocks containing only valid transactions) can be
added onto the blockchain; and this mechanism is called
consensus algorithm [34]. In consensus algorithms, a block
is considered valid if the majority of participants in the
network agree on its validity. Moreover, a transaction is
valid if the digital signature of the sender is valid and the
amount of tokens sent does not exceed the sender’s balance.
Currently, there are different consensus algorithms [35] and
the popular ones include Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of
Stake (PoS) algorithms [34]. In PoW, nodes in the network
compete to solve a complex puzzle and who finds the
correct solution first will become the block proposer for
the next block (the miner) and earn a reward. Specifically,
it requires exhaustively searching for a solution string, nonce,
such that cryptographic hash of the concatenation of x, the
previous block’s header, and the nonce satisfies the following
condition:
Hash(x, nonce) ≤ target,
where x is the previous block’s header, target is a small value
determining the hardness of the current block, and nonce is
the solution that miners search for. Since miners use brute
force to find the satisfied nonce, the more computational
capacity a node possesses, the higher possibility it wins
the race, thus becoming block proposer for the next
block.
On the other hand, in PoS, the possibility for a node to
become the block proposer is proportional to the amount
of financial resource it owns [34]. In a normal case, after a
block proposer is chosen, the proposer will validate certain
transactions received from other nodes, and then gather the
valid ones to form a block [32]. The proposer also attaches
a proof into the block, proving that it is the right node to
produce the next block (e.g., the proof in PoW is the solution
for the mathematical problem). Then, it broadcasts the block
to the rest of the network. All other nodes receive the block
and validate the transactions. If honest nodes see that all
transactions in the block are valid and the attached proof is
correct, they must append the block to their own local chain.
26264 VOLUME 11, 2023
V. T. Truong et al.: Blockchain Meets Metaverse and Digital Asset Management: A Comprehensive Survey
If the majority of the network accepts the block, we can say
that the network has reached consensus for that block [34].
C. SMART CONTRACT
Blockchains supporting smart contracts usually follows the
account-based model, in which each user owns an account
with the corresponding account address and the account
balance. It operates similar to a state machine which receives
transactions as inputs, then changes its state accordingly. The
blockchain global state represents all user accounts and some
special accounts, which are smart contract accounts [36].
A smart contract account also has an address and its balance.
However, it stores a piece of code, similar to a computer
program. Anyone can write and deploy smart contracts to
the network, but they are not controlled by any user once
created. Users can interact with a contract account and
trigger its code by submitting transactions that execute a
function defined inside the contract. Since smart contract
accounts are available on-chain, every participant can verify
its source code and make sure of its functionality [36].
Contract functions are executed automatically without any
trust assumption and intervention of intermediaries. However,
smart contracts are immutable once they are deployed, thus
theymust be designed and tested carefully before deployment
to prevent potential issues [37], [38].
With smart contracts, blockchain technology goes far
beyond a mere ledger of financial transactions. One
well-known application of smart contract is NFT. NFTs
are cryptographic tokens stored on blockchain that prove
the ownership of digital assets [13]. NFTs cannot be
counterfeited or divided as they are often represented by
the ERC-721 standard, in which each of them has a unique
identification for recognition. This means that while we can
buy, for example, 10 bitcoins or 10 Ethers, there is no sense of
‘‘10 NFTs in general’’ because all NFTs are totally different
from each other. Smart contract is also the foundation of
DeFi and dApps. DApps are applications whose back-end
is built by smart contracts, making them fair, transparent,
and cannot be dominated by attackers [16]. DeFi [15] is
an emerging financial technology which provides users a
variety of financial services such as borrowing, lending and
investment without third-party authorities like central bank or
financial corporations.
D. BLOCKCHAIN INTEROPERABILITY
Blockchain interoperability refers to the ability of dif-
ferent blockchains to communicate with each other to
exchange cryptocurrencies, tokens, and any type of digital
asset [39]. It can help independent blockchains to connect
together to form a large network, which could be consid-
ered to be the Internet of blockchains [40]. In general,
blockchain interoperability often includes cross-chain bridge
and multi-chain platform, which are discussed in the
following.
• Cross-chain Bridge: This presents a mechanism con-
necting two arbitrary independent blockchains together.
FIGURE 4. The general operation of blockchain cross-chain
communication. The process above with red lines is to transfer tokens
from one blockchain to another, while the figure below with green lines
illustrates how tokens are transferred back to the original chain.
Some current popular bridges include Binance Bridge,5
Umbria Narni Bridge,6 and Wormhole.7
• Multi-chain Platform: Instead of connecting indepen-
dent blockchains, a multi-chain platform is usually
an ecosystem with multiple built-in blockchains. Cur-
rent prominent multi-chain ecosystems include Polka-
dot [41] and Cosmos [42].
Figure. 4 illustrates a high-level description of cross-
chain communication between two blockchains A and B.
Specifically, when a node on blockchain A wants to send
some tokens to its account on blockchain B, it firstly deposits
them to a custodian smart contract on the blockchain A,
in which the tokens are locked. A third-party service provider
called the operator takes responsibility for collecting all
of these deposit transactions and sending them to an
issuer smart contract on the blockchain B. This smart
contract automatically issues wrapped tokens, which are the
representation of the original deposited tokens, to the node’s
address on the blockchain B. After that, these wrapped tokens
could be traded normally on the chain B. Whenever a node
wants to transfer its tokens back to the chain A, it sends them
to the issuer smart contract in which these wrapped tokens
are burned, while the deposited tokens are unlocked and send
back to the owner on the chain A by the custodian smart
contract.
IV. BLOCKCHAIN-ENABLED METAVERSE: USER
APPLICATIONS
In this section, we present potential contributions of
blockchain technology to the metaverse from the user
applications perspective, including the metaverse economic
system and metaverse virtual services. According to various
metaverse features and applications, a summary of some
existing metaverse platforms based on these features is
provided in Table 3, while Fig. 5 illustrates blockchain-based

use cases for metaverse user application and potential issues
that are discussed in this section.
A. METAVERSE ECONOMIC SYSTEM
The virtual economic system in the decentralized metaverse
would be an integration of various types of digital assets such
as blockchain native cryptocurrency, fungible token, NFT-
based UGCs and virtual real estate. With the decentralized
nature of blockchain, the metaverse economic system with
its own virtual currency is projected to operate transparently
and verifiably without the need for intermediaries [3].
In the metaverse creator economy, users can produce con-
tent (i.e., UGC) and trade them in the provided marketplace
to earn cryptocurrency and tokens. In this use case, NFT can
be used to tokenize UGC to ensure its uniqueness and prevent
counterfeiting, while the metadata is often stored in off-chain
environment to reduce storage cost. Similarly, virtual real
estate in the metaverse can be tokenized as NFT to make it
scarce and valuable. For instance, creators in Roblox can earn
certain Robux (i.e., virtual tokens of the platform) for creating
UGCs such as items and game scenes, while Decentraland
users can trade virtual real estate ‘‘LANE’’, an ERC-721
token in the Ethereum blockchain, through the platform’s
currency.
However, there are potential security and trust issues
of blockchain-based tokens and cryptocurrency [43], [44],
especially when it is adopted widely in the metaverse.
In terms of cryptocurrency attacks, the authors in [45]
formalized cryptocurrencies to find solutions addressing
the double spending and secret mining problems. They
develop an equilibrium model with a certain confirmation
lag that disincentivizes users from double spending. With
the proposed model, it is shown that attackers must spend
more resource than the monetary benefits obtained from
the attack. Besides, selfish mining is another well-known
attack, in which the attackers attempt to fork a blockchain
by privately maintaining a chain that is longer than the
public branch [46]. To prevent this type of attack, the authors
in [47] proposed a solution in which there is a ‘‘truth state’’
within block data to identify selfish miners. It is computed
based on an indication that if the difference between the
previous block’s average expected height and the current
block’s height is significant, it is highly likely that the miner
withheld the block to conduct selfish mining. In terms of
privacy, the authors in [48] discuss anonymity issues of
different cryptocurrencies, and possible designs have been
pointed out to preserve privacy of cryptocurrency systems.
Specifically, ZKP allows users to prove that their transactions
are valid under the blockchain consensus rules without
revealing any of the computed information [49], whereas
mixing protocols make participants anonymous within the
platform by permuting ownership of cryptocurrency.
In terms of token-based UGC and virtual real estate, the
key challenge is to ensure the integrity of smart contract
on which the tokens are deployed, thereby preventing asset
counterfeiting. Due to the immutable nature of blockchain,
smart contract are unchangeable once they are deployed,
thus requiring thorough testing and validation during its
development [38]. To this end, the authors in [37] introduced a
novel test pattern for reliable smart contract verification. The
proposed symmetrical testing method reduces the required
number of test cases to just one more than the number
of verification rules, leading to a significant decrease in
execution time to only a fewmilliseconds. The authors in [50]
analyzed security vulnerabilities of smart contract, including
transaction ordering dependence, time stamp dependence,
mishandled exceptions, and reentrancy attack. Consequently,
they proposed OYENTE, a framework detecting security
issues of smart contract based on its bytecode. The framework
was then evaluated in 19,366 Ethereum smart contracts,
showing its practicality and robustness.
B. METAVERSE ENTERTAINMENT
Themetaverse has the potential to revolutionize the entertain-
ment industry through a wide range of applications, including
gaming and virtual events. An example metaverse game is
Roblox, a worldwide platform for user-generated games that
enables users to create their own block-based avatars and
play a variety of games. When it comes to metaverse virtual
event, hundreds of graduating UC Berkeley students attended
a virtual commencement ceremony organized in Minecraft,
while more than 12 million people participated in the virtual
concert of Travis Scott in Fortnite [51].
In terms of metaverse gaming, blockchain and NFT can be
utilized to tokenize in-game assets to make them unique and
valuable. The authors in [52] proposed a blockchain-based
gaming platform that leverages NFT to represent in-game
assets, thereby offering effective asset tracking and reward
administration. Additionally, blockchain is also utilized for
profile management and providing efficient data exchange
among players within the game. On the other hand, metaverse
gambling games (e.g., the poker game in certain locations of
Decentraland)may be designed to give players a disadvantage
with a high likelihood of losing their tokens. In this case,
blockchain can guarantee the transparency of in-game rules
and the fairness of the random generation process. For
instance, the authors in [53] proposed a blockchain-based
algorithm that generates random number in a decentralized
manner. In particular, the final random number is calculated
based on the random numbers of both the game provider,
players, and an on-chain random number. As multiple
participants involve in the generation process, the results are
verifiable and cannot bemanipulated by any centralized party.
For virtual events in the metaverse, blockchain can be
utilized for ticket management, in which tickets are securely
linked to their buyers and all associated transactions are
transparent on the blockchain, making them resistant to
tampering and enabling verification. To this end, Cha et al.
proposed a privacy preserving blockchain-based ticketing
service [54], using blockchains to store information related to
events and tickets, whereas Non-Interactive ZKP are used to

preserve user privacy. It allows users to prove the ownership
to their tickets and ensures the integrity of data, while user
privacy is guaranteed as personal information is not required
to be provided.
C. METAVERSE FINANCIAL SERVICES
In the physical world, we often participate in a wide range of
financial activities such as lending, borrowing, saving, and
stock investment. Similarly, the metaverse can also reflect
those activities and services, in which blockchain along with
the emerging DeFi technologies provide suitable tools to
realize them in a decentralized manner. In general, financial
activities can be classified into three groups, which are
personal, corporate, and public finance.
In terms of personal finance, possible use cases for the
metaverse include lending, borrowing, saving and investment
in the virtual world. The authors in [55] proposed an
architecture using Hyperledger Fabric as a trusted service
to enhance the reliability and security of the peer-to-
peer lending process. While loan transactions are collected
and submitted to the blockchain network by Order nodes,
smart contracts regulate the registration process, making
it automatic with trust establishment. The authors in [56]
proposed a decentralized credit evaluation model based on
blockchain and Prospect Theory to minimize the risk of
lending. In this system, blockchain takes over the role
of third-party organizations in receiving loan funding and
determining criteria. Because transactions on the blockchain
are verified and permanent, they can be used to assess user’s
credit using Prospect Theory, which is a reliable method for
determining whether to grant a loan to a specific user.
On the other hand, blockchain technology can facilitate
corporate finance in stock issuing and exchange. The
authors in [57] proposed a decentralized stock exchange
platform operating on top of a consortium blockchain. Unlike
traditional platforms regulated by a third-party authority,
participants in this scheme interact with a smart contract
to place orders. The smart contract is preprogrammed
with necessary rules and business logic so that a trade
is generated securely whenever the prices are matched
between the orders. Blockchain network ensures information
transparency, availability and security, while experimental
results also prove the performance and efficiency of the
system [57].
VOLUME 11, 2023 26267
V. T. Truong et al.: Blockchain Meets Metaverse and Digital Asset Management: A Comprehensive Survey
In terms of public finance, it includes social financial
services such as insurance and taxation. For these purposes,
blockchain technology can be a game changer by offering
transparency and verifiability properties for documents. The
authors in [58] introduced BlockCIS, a smart contract-based
cyber insurance framework using Hyperledger Composer.
When a customer node suffers a cyber attack, it submits the
logs (e.g., firewall or storage logs) to the BlockCIS system as
an evidence of the intrusion. Thus, the insurers can compute
the premium and fees based on the analyzed logs, which
are transparent, verifiable, and permanently stored on the
blockchain network.
D. METAVERSE SOCIAL SERVICES
The metaverse is envisioned to be a complete virtual society,
thus it has the potential to revolutionize the delivery of social
services and make them more accessible and convenient.
In the context of healthcare, the metaverse can provide
virtual consultations, remote monitoring, and telemedicine
services, thereby reducing the need for physical appearance
at hospitals [6]. For education, the metaverse can provide
a platform for virtual classrooms and enable immersive
learning experiences. This can greatly increase access to
education, removing geographic limitations and expanding
educational opportunities.
In the metaverse, while many of healthcare applications
are based on virtual reality technology, blockchain also
offers various benefits for medical management [59]. The
authors in [60] proposedMedRec, a decentralized permission
management scheme for medical record based on Ethereum
blockchain. In [60], medical records are managed by three
different smart contracts. Firstly, the Registrar Contract with
embedded policies regulates participants’ identity and maps
their ID to Ethereum address. The Relationship Contract
allows healthcare providers to access patient data, while
patients can refer to all healthcare providers they have been
engaged with thanks to the Summary Contract. On the
other hand, the linkability between user identification and
Ethereum address by the Registrar Contract can threaten
data privacy. Liu et al. [61] proposed a medical management
framework with enhanced privacy protection. In this scheme,
medical data are encrypted by patients’ public key and
stored on a DPoS-based blockchain, thus ensuring privacy
and immutability of medical record. Proxy re-encryption
enables medical data sharing between patients and doctors
by allowing authorized doctors to decrypt the ciphertext to
obtain the medical plain text without knowing the patient’s
private key.
With respect to metaverse education, blockchain can
facilitate educational administration [62] and offer CIA
(i.e., confidentiality, integrity, and availability) to education
microservices [63]. The authors in [62] proposed EduCTX,8
a blockchain-based credit platform for global education
with transparency and verifiability. In this scheme, student’s
8http://eductx.org/
credits are represented by the ECTX tokens offered in the
DPoS-based blockchain network. While multisignature tech-
nique is utilized to guarantee security of token transaction,
the blockchain enables a global community between different
institutions without national and administrative barriers,
which totally fits with the global nature of the metaverse.
Besides, the authors in [63] leverage blockchain to offer
cyber defense with CIA for education microservices. In [63],
different educational organizations join a blockchain network
in which education data and microservice transactions are
immutable on-chain to offer integrity. Confidentiality is
obtained thanks to a dual hybrid cryptosystem consisting
of RSA and AES, while an access control model provide
availability feature.
V. BLOCKCHAIN-ENABLED METAVERSE: SYSTEM
PERSPECTIVE
In this section, we discuss the potentials of blockchain for
the metaverse from the system perspective, including identity
and authentication management, decentralized governance,
reputation system, and decentralized data management. They
are summarized in Fig. 7.
A. IDENTITY AND AUTHENTICATION MANAGEMENT
Depending on specific purposes, one may have various
identities such as identification, passport, and driver license.
In specific circumstances, we must present our identity
credentials to access certain services or activities. Similarly,
identity also plays a vital role in the virtual world. Firstly,
authentication must be established to allow metaverse
users with their wearable devices to obtain access to the
platform with proper identity. Moreover, IoT devices in
metaverse infrastructure (e.g., sensors, UAVs) also need
effective mechanisms to authenticate during their opera-
tions. To this end, identity management of IoT devices
can benefit from blockchain [64] with decentralized solu-
tions for key management [65], cross-domain authentica-
tion [66], [67], mutual authentication [68], and privacy
preservation [69].
1) SELF-SOVEREIGN IDENTITY
While centralized identity and federated identity [70] are
vulnerable to potential third-party risks, Self-sovereign Iden-
tity [71] (SSI) could be an appropriate authentication method
for the decentralized metaverse. With SSI, users can prove
their identity through verifiable credentials or claims [71].
Each user or organization is associated with a unique decen-
tralized identifier document (DID), which can be used across
different platforms. To this end, blockchain technology plays
the role of storing all DIDs and making them immutable,
transparent, and secure thanks to its decentralized property.
For instance, the authors in [72] proposed a blockchain-based
SSI model for passport-level biometry of Dutch government
with advanced security features. The model leverages a per-
sonalized blockchain, TrustChain [73], to provide portability,
26268 VOLUME 11, 2023

FIGURE 6. Bubbles of trust for IoT authentication presented in [74].
interoperability, minimalization, and protection for the claim
format. Both interactive and non-interactive ZKP methods
are implemented in four different schemes to minimize
disclosure of claims and enhance portability. Performance
evaluation of the four schemes also shows the model’s
efficiency and practicality.
2) THREATS FROM SPOF AND UNAUTHORIZED ENTITIES
Unauthorized users can exploit the vulnerabilities of cen-
tralized authentication system to get illegal access to the
metaverse. As a result, they can participate in malicious
activities such as phishing, scamming, and impersonation.
In terms of user-side authenciation management, Esposito
et al. [75] presented a distributed authentication framework
for smart city applications based on blockchain technology.
In particular, they integrate blockchain into FIWARE [76]
and OAuth2 [77]. While XACML policies are stored
in blockchain, FIWARE identity operations are regulated
automatically by chaincode (i.e., smart contract) to provide
decentralization. As a result, the framework can protect
identity data frommalicious and unauthorized users in a large
scale scenario by using blockchain to remove Single Point of
Failure (SPOF).
3) INTEGRITY OF IDENTITY DATA
If identity data of metaverse users are altered by malicious
actors (e.g., during communication and message exchange),
it could lead to serious security risks, resulting in financial
losses, reputation damage, and privacy violations. The
authors in [74] introduced bubbles of trust, a blockchain-
based authentication system for IoT devices that can
protect data integrity and availability. In particular, the
system provides ‘‘bubble’’ zones (presented in Fig. 6) that
allow devices to identify and trust each other within a
same zone, while considering devices in other zones as
malicious. Besides, messages exchanged in the platform are
all signed by the ECDSA algorithm using the associated
blockchain private key. These mechanisms offer secure
communication between devices, providing resistance to
sybil attack, spoofing attack, non-repudiation, and message
substitution [74].
4) RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS OF WEARABLE IoT DEVICES
Wearable IoT devices used bymetaverse users often have lim-
ited computation and storage capacity, while the capacity also
varies among devices. To overcome performance limitations
of IoT authentication, the authors in [78] proposed a hybrid
blockchain-based scheme for multi-WSN. In the design
(Fig. 8), IoT nodes are divided into different types based
on their capability, forming a hierarchical structure including
base station, cluster head nodes, and ordinary nodes. Base
station with highest computing and storage resources is
connected to a public blockchain. It manages authentication
of its subnet’s nodes which are implemented in a local
blockchain. While ordinary nodes (with low energy and
computing capacity such as camera or sensor) collect data,
the data are preprocessed and forwarded to the node manager
by cluster head nodes (with certain storage and computing
resources). By doing so, the system is optimized based on
nodes’ capacities, thus achieving higher performance, while
it is shown to be resistant to sybil, denial-of-service (DoS),
message replay, substitution, and man in the middle (MITM)
attack.
While wearable IoT devices are resource-limited, edge
nodes can offer computation offloading to facilitate the
authentication process. To improve the efficiency of dis-
tributed authentication systems, an authentication scheme
based on blockchain and edge computing is proposed by
the authors in [79]. Specifically, authentication data and logs
are stored on a blockchain with optimized PBFT consensus
algorithm. A novel caching strategy based on edge computing
and belief propagation is proposed to enhance hit ratio. Thus,
optimized edge nodes can obtain enough resource to provide
efficient authentication service based on smart contracts.
According to simulation results in [79], hit ratio is about
8%-14% more efficient than other existing strategies, while
the figure for average delay is improved 6%–12%.
5) KEY MANAGEMENT IN AUTHENTICATION
To provide higher flexibility of key management, the authors
in [80] proposed a blockchain-based mutual authentication
protocol with dynamic key management for edge computing.
In this protocol, edge severs participate in a blockchain
system, in which a smart contract is designed to manage user
keys after registration. It allows flexible key update and revo-
cation without any trusted center, while eliminating the need
for computationally expensive cryptographic mechanisms in
key management. Therefore, the computational costs for the
framework are around 80ms for the end-user and 8ms for the
edge server, with a communication cost of 3.4 MB. These
results show an improvement of 5-15% compared to existing
platforms [81]. Besides, the framework is also shown to resist
impersonation, replay, and stolen verifier attacks.
B. METAVERSE DECENTRALIZED GOVERNANCE
Governance plays a crucial role in determining the future of
any digital platform. In traditional centralized systems, the
VOLUME 11, 2023 26269

FIGURE 8. Hierarchical architecture of blockchain-based Multi-WSN
model in [78].
platform provider has complete control over its development.
They could unilaterally release updates that alter the rules and
policies of the virtual world, leaving users with no option
but to accept all the changes. Inevitably, the decentralized
metaverse needs a democratic governance scheme in which
users have a voice in deciding the virtual world’s future.
To this end, blockchain technology offers DAO, a potential
solution for decentralized governance in the metaverse.
Unlike traditional centralized systems, DAOs are flat and
democratic, with members required to vote for any changes
or updates to be approved. For instance, Decentraland is
a popular platform adopting DAO, where stakeholders can
vote to determine policy update, including a wide range of
aspects such as upgrading LAND, specifying dates of LAND
auctions, and determining marketplace fees. In addition,
blockchain and smart contract can be utilized in various
ways to build reliable voting and decentralized governance
schemes for the metaverse [82].
1) RELIABILITY OF GOVERNANCE SYSTEM
In decentralized governance schemes, integrity is the first
and foremost factor deciding democracy of the platform. The
authors in [83] presented BSJC, a proof of completeness
algorithm that builds a specific blockchain for electronic
voting platforms. In this scheme, votes are represented as
transactions on a permissioned blockchain network, in which
they are hashed to form aMerkle hash tree. With the recorded
on-chain information, the authority can confidently query
the voting counts, verify duplication of votes, and ensure
the integrity of votes. However, there is still a third-party
authority involving in the process, making it vulnerable to
data leakage and tallying issues.
2) IDENTITY DISCLOSURE
During the election or voting process, user identity might be
leaked, threatening the privacy of participants. To protect the
tally and provide higher privacy, the authors in [84] proposed
a blockchain-based self-tallying voting system named Open
Vote Network. In [84], participants represent binary votes
as blockchain-based zero-knowledge proofs. The proofs
indicate voters’ decision (i.e., voting yes or no) and prove
voters’ identity without revealing such their identity thanks to
ZKP algorithm. In addition, smart contracts can compute the
tally so that the system does not need a third-party authority
counting and verifying the votes. However, the voting size
in the proposed framework was limited to just around
60 electors. This scalability and performance limitations
could hinder it from being adopted in a large-scale system
like the metaverse.
3) BLOCKCHAIN PERFORMANCE LIMITATION
Blockchain often suffers scalability issues due to its decen-
tralized nature, impacting on the performance of the overall
system. To fill the gap of performance constraint, Khan
et al. [85] investigated a wide range of permissioned and
permissionless blockchain settings across different scenarios
of their e-voting system. With a specific hardware specifi-
cation, they adjust blockchain parameters, including block
size, block rate, number of miners, difficulty of PoW, and
26270 VOLUME 11, 2023
V. T. Truong et al.: Blockchain Meets Metaverse and Digital Asset Management: A Comprehensive Survey
the number of concurrent clients to determine an optimized
architecture with trade-offs between properties. However,
there is no mechanism filtering out invalid voters in the
proposed scheme, while it is shown to be insecure against
quantum attacks [86].
4) QUANTUM THREATS
In the future, quantum computing technology might pose
potential threats to blockchain-based systems [87]. To this
end, the authors in [88] proposed an anti-quantum voting
protocol using blockchain to offer tamper-resistant and
decentralization features. They used a modified version
of the code-based Niederreiter algorithm, an NP-complete
Syndrome Decoding problem which is difficult to solve even
with powerful quantum computers. Furthermore, blockchain
and Key Generation Center in certificateless cryptosystem
provide transparency and auditing functions to the platform.
5) COST EFFICIENCY
In a large-scale scenario, financial cost efficiency is also an
important factor in blockchain-based governance schemes.
The authors in [89] proposed a framework for e-voting system
using smart contracts to enable cost-efficient election. The
system utilizes a PoA-based permissioned blockchain with
significantly lower cost and traffic compared to public chains
of other platforms. Besides, it uses district-based voting to
offer coercion resistance, while there are ‘‘bootnodes’’ that
help district nodes to discover each other more efficiently.
C. REPUTATION SYSTEM
A reputation system allows users and service providers to
build trust through feedback, rankings, ratings, and reviews
of users for any service they have received. This can be
an incentive mechanism which encourages service providers
to offer quality services to maintain their reputation. When
it comes to the metaverse, a reliable reputation system
can provide a powerful trust mechanism to prevent fraud,
scam, and improve the quality of service throughout the
ecosystem. It allows users to rate each other after receiving
the products, services, or any interaction with the others
in the virtual world. Regarding this purpose, blockchain
technology can be integrated into the reputation system to
offer security [90], fairness [91], performance efficiency [92],
and privacy perservation [93], [94], [95].
1) FAKE REPUTATION
Fake reputation can be popular in centralized platforms,
in which users can create fake accounts to rate for themselves,
while the central organization can also modify the rating
data to earn financial benefits. The authors in [90] proposed
a blockchain-based reputation system which resists fake
reviews, sybil and collusion attacks. In this scheme, low
reputation users must stake tokens into a triple signed wallet
of PoS blockchain. Thismechanism, alongwith the expensive
cost of entrance, can discourage malicious reviews and sybil
attacks effectively. Besides, an average-scoring mechanism
and time interval between reviews are introduced to prevent
collusion attacks.
2) ANONYMITY AND RETALIATION
In the metaverse reputation system, users may hesitate to vote
low ratings due to the fear of retaliation from the recipients.
To prevent bad-mouthing attacks, the authors in [94]
proposed a trustless reputation system that offers anominity
based on blockchain technology. In this scheme, the service
provider must provide a token to the customer just before a
purchasing transaction takes place. This token is based on the
signature protocol, allowing the customer to prove that she is
eligible to submit a review, while the token-based review will
be unlinkable to the original blockchain transaction. This not
only protects the service provider from bad-mouthing attacks,
but also ensures privacy of customers since the reviews are
verified without correlating to the reviewers’ identity.
Moreover, the authors in [93] further elaborate the privacy
requirements of reputation system in which not only the rat-
ing provider’s identity is protected, but also the privacy of the
rating weights and rating aggregation process is guaranteed.
In their proposed system, ratings are recorded and managed
by a blockchain with hybird consensus algorithm mixed
between PoW and PoS. Rating provider’s identity and the
rating weights (assigned by reputation requesters) are both
encrypted to provide anonymity for raters and requesters.
In the rating aggregation process, homomorphic encryption
is utilized to allow the aggregator to compute the final
reputation without decrypting the rating weights.
3) EFFICIENCY AND SCALABILITY
A blockchain-based reputation system might suffer from low
efficiency due to scalability issue of blockchain. To overcome
this problem, the authors in [96] proposed an anonymous rep-
utation system IIoT-Enabled Retail Marketing, in which the
state-of-the-art Ouroboros consensus mechanism is utilized
to provide higher efficiency and provable security. In this
system, service providers act as stakeholders in Ouroboros
PoS protocol, and the reputations are associated with their
stake. Operations including review generation, verification,
and aggregation are performed on smart contracts to ensure
reliability, while registration and rating token generation
are performed off-chain to reduce computation overhead
of the blockchain and improve scalability. Furthermore,
Bulletproof [97] is used as an efficient method to provide
unlinkability between reviews and identities. A proof-of-
concept prototype on Parity Ethereum has been conducted,
showing that computation costs are only around 250-500 ms
for rating token generation and registration processes.
4) THIRD-PARTY INTERFERENCE
To truly realize the decentralized metaverse, the intervention
of third-party authorities must be minimized or even elimi-
nated. Li et al. [98] presented a blockchain-based reputation
VOLUME 11, 2023 26271
V. T. Truong et al.: Blockchain Meets Metaverse and Digital Asset Management: A Comprehensive Survey
TABLE 4. The trade-offs between different methods of data storage for the metaverse.
system for e-commerce, RepChain, which is publicly verifi-
able without third-party intervention. Specifically, two-move
lind signatures are leveraged to create anonymous credentials
for the reviews, thus offering unlinkability of transaction and
preventing user identity from being leaked. Zero-Knowledge
Range Proof (ZKRP) is used to verify the submitted reviews
and detect abnormal reviews. Certificate Authority is the
only centralized party in [98], but it only takes responsibility
for generating cryptographic keys, and will go offline after
finishing the entity registration process. Therefore, the ratings
would be more reliable, while the system remains fully
decentralized thanks to blockchain.
5) FAIRNESS CONSIDERATION
Fairness is also a major concern of the metaverse reputation
system to ensure participant’s benefits. The authors in [91]
proposed a blockchain-based reputation system emphasizing
fairness for peer-to-peer energy trading. In this scheme, the
reputation rating is weighted based on a linear combination
of all participants’ current reputation scores. Intuitively, the
vote of a low-reputation user should have less impact than
the ones with high reputation score. There are also a set of
significance factors to adjust the impact of each role (i.e., the
seller, buyer, and consensus node) in the formula based on
specific use cases [91]. As a result, it could further improve
the fairness and quality of reviews in the system.
D. DECENTRALIZED DATA MANAGEMENT
Data management in the metaverse is a critical task impacting
on most aspects of the platform. In general, Metaverse
data can consist of various sources such as (i) user-
generated data from metaverse service providers and users’
activities; (ii) infrastructure data collecting by IoT devices
for virtual-physical synchronization; (iii) Computation data
from computing processes such as edge and cloud computing.
However, if data in the metaverse are all stored in traditional
centralized databases, they would be vulnerable to various
risks such as SPOF, third-party, and privacy issues.
For data management, blockchain technology can offer
a wide range of advantages such as decentralization [99],
security [100], [101], and auditability [102]. However, storing
data on blockchains is extremely expensive due to its
decentralized nature. One approach to address the limitations
of blockchain with regards to storage cost and capacity
is to use consortium blockchain, in which access is only
granted to authorized participants, thus reducing the amount
of on-chain data stored, improving the processing speed,
and reducing transaction cost. Another solution for data
storage in the metaverse is to leverage off-chain mechanisms,
in which only the hash and a small part of the data are
stored on the blockchain, while the metadata can be stored
by traditional storage mechanisms. Illustrated in Table 4, the
extent of decentralization, storage cost, and transparency can
be adjusted based on different storage strategies.
1) VIRTUAL-PHYSICAL SYNCHRONIZATION
In virtual-physical synchronization process, blockchain-
based data management can help to manage data collecting
by IoT devices in the physical world [103]. Li et al. [104]
proposed a blockchain-based scheme for large-scale IoT data
storage, in which a blockchain replaces third party to manage
data storage with trust ensuring. In this scheme, massive
data from IoT devices are collected by the corresponding
edge servers, then forwarded to the blockchain as transactions
to authenticate the devices. Besides, certificateless cryptog-
raphy is implemented to offer an efficient way to identify
IoT devices. As a result, the design is proved to be IND-
CCA secure, while it achieves traceability and accountability
thanks to the blockchain’s features.
2) OFF-CHAIN CLOUD STORAGE
The massive amount of data generated from the metaverse’s
operation may exceed the storage capacity of blockchain,
thus necessitating the use of cloud storage. In this case,
blockchain can provide integrity services for the cloud [105].
Regarding off-chain cloud storage, the authors in [106]
proposed a blockchain-based data storage for IoT with data
integrity protection. In the proposal, a dynamic data integrity
verification protocol is implemented via smart contracts,
called DIS smart contracts. Whenever data are uploaded to
cloud storage, the data owner can trigger the DIS smart
contract to verify the uploaded data. It compares the hash
provided by the data owner and the cloud-based hash
to determine the validity of data, ensuring data integrity.
A prototype of the system has been constructed to prove its
high performance and feasibility.
3) EDGE DATA MANAGEMENT
Certain light-weight tasks of wearable devices can be
processed in edge environment without committing to
cloud servers, providing faster response and computation
efficiency. Regarding edge computing, the authors in [101]
proposed a framework for edge data management with
blockchain-based trust establishment. In this scheme, smart
26272 VOLUME 11, 2023

FIGURE 9. Internet-inspired architecture for blockchain data
interoperability presented in [110].
contracts in the blockchain network layer take responsibility
for edge data management operations (e.g., data invoking
and transferring), providing trust and data integrity. Besides,
sensitive edge data are protected thanks to a matrix-based
multichannel architecture with conditional access, making
the data invisible among users in different channels.
In terms of edge data sharing, the authors in [107]
developed a reputation-based data sharing framework for
edge computing with verifiable credibility of data source.
Firstly, edge nodes are incentivized to contribute to storage
resource through a DSSC smart contract with proof of
storage. Secondly, they act as miners in a PoW process
of ISSC smart contract to provide data sharing, searching,
and auditing for data requestors. Besides, a three-weight
subjective logic model is designed to estimate reliability of
data based on interaction frequency, event timeliness, and
trajectory similarity of data source.
4) DATA REDUNDANCY AND STORAGE COST
In blockchain data storage, every consensus node must store
a replica of the on-chain data, causing high data redundancy
and storage cost. The authors in [108] proposed an algorithm
to reduce this resource overhead issue based on regenerative
code technology, which allows failed data on a damaged node
to be recovered by surviving nodes in the network [109]. For
instance, if the original data are extended by certain amount
of regenerative code, a proportional number of nodes are
allowed to be damaged without impacting on data integrity.
Experimental results show that the proposed framework can
reconstruct the original files with real-time performance and
offers blockchain-enabled security features.
5) DATA INTEROPERABILITY LIMITATION
In blockchain-based data management in the metaverse, the
independence among blockchain platforms can be an obstacle
to data sharing. Consequently, higher level of decentralized
data management requires data interoperability between
different blockchains. This can include the communication
between public blockchains as well as between both public
and permissioned blockchains [39]. To this end, the authors
in [110] proposed an internet-inspired blockchain archi-
tecture offering data interoperability based on blockchain
gateways. As shown in Fig. 9, blockchain networks are
modelled as autonomous systems (i.e., routing domains in the
Internet architecture). Consensus nodes in blockchain play
the role of local gateways within its domain, while there are
certain nodes take responsibility for global communications
(i.e., inter-domain gateways). Due to the isolation and
independence among domains, inter-domain gateways must
establish technical trust based on hardware devices, including
TPM [111] and SGX [112]. By doing so, blockchain systems
can inherit fundamental properties of the Internet such as
interoperability, survivability, and manageability.
However, blockchain gateways could suffer from crashing
due to external attacks. Belchior et al. [113] proposed Her-
mes, a middleware framework for blockchain interoperability
that offers crash-recovery features for gateways based on
ODAP protocol [114]. Whenever a blockchain gateway is
crashed, based on a rollback timeout, the protocol either
(i) recovers the gateway operations using its logs within the
timeout, or (ii) rollbacks the gateway to its previous state
on the affected blockchains. The proposed framework makes
gateway-based data interoperability more reliable and able to
withstand various attacks.
VI. BLOCKCHAIN FOR SECURITY AND PRIVACY OF
METAVERSE INFRASTRUCTURE
The metaverse is envisioned to exceed far beyond the
entertainment purpose, including a variety of activities related
to economy, finance, and business [3]. Therefore, security
and privacy are obviously critical factors that impacts on
most components of the virtual world [2]. While Sections
IV and V have illustrated the potentials of blockchain in
providing security and privacy of metaverse applications,
this section focuses on security and privacy for metaverse
infrastructure divided into three layers, namelymetaverse end
devices, communication network, computing and storage.
In particular, the security and privacy threats are discussed for
the three layers of the metaverse infrastructure, as illustrated
in Fig. 10. While many traditional approaches have been
developed to tackle these threats, blockchain-based solutions
also show the potential in solving many of the mentioned
issues. Due to the scope of our paper, we will only discuss
blockchain-based countermeasures for metaverse security
and privacy threats in the following.
A. THREATS TO METAVERSE END DEVICES
In the metaverse, users are often equipped with wearable
virtual-reality devices (e.g., AR/VR headsets, haptic gloves)
to participate in the virtual world. Besides, metaverse end
devices also include numerous IoT and mobile devices that
collect real-world data to reflect into the virtual environment
through DT. Regarding end devices, various attacks can be
launched.
1) ACCESS CONTROL ATTACK
Attackers can exploit the vulnerability of access control
process to allow unauthorized devices to get access to the
metaverse system, while preventing eligible devices from
VOLUME 11, 2023 26273

TABLE 5. Literature reviews on various issues in the blockchain-enabled metaverse and possible solutions based on existing works.
participating in the platform [115]. Once obtaining illegal
access to the system, unauthorized avatars can impersonate
legitimate users or devices, thereby conducting phishing
scam, digital footprint tracking [116], and deceiving the
victim’s friends in the metaverse.
2) MALWARE ATTACK
One major source of security and privacy issues is the ability
to inject malicious third-party applications (i.e., malware)
intometaverse end devices [117]. Through these applications,
attackers can dominate the devices, stealing sensitive data and
disrupting their operation [118]. Currently, malware is mainly
spread through traditional methods such as email attachments
and malicious websites. When it comes to the metaverse,
interaction between users are significantly enhanced with
virtual reality technology, thus it would be more potential
for attackers to convince and trick victims into accessing
malicious sources through their devices.
26274 VOLUME 11, 2023
V. T. Truong et al.: Blockchain Meets Metaverse and Digital Asset Management: A Comprehensive Survey
FIGURE 10. Security and privacy threats in the metaverse infrastructure.
3) LOCATION AND DIGITAL FOOTPRINT TRACKING
If physical location ofmetaverse users is tracked through their
wearable devices, metaverse-related crimes may no longer
limited to the virtual world, but also in the real world. Besides,
hackers can collect avatar’s digital footprints to link the
avatars to the corresponding real-world identities based on the
recorded behavior pattern and habits from their devices [2].
4) END-DEVICE DATA LEAKAGE
Wearable AR/VR devices would collect far more sensitive
data from metaverse users compared to traditional platforms.
For example, the devices would scan user’s appearance to
construct avatars in the virtual world, while user’s voice and
activities are also recorded to be reflected into the avatars.
Thus, end devices can be a powerful source of personal data
leakage, which can be used for further social engineering
attacks such as impersonation and phishing scam.
5) FIRMWARE VULNERABILITIES
Firmware is another vulnerable target with low-level control
of devices. While malicious firmware can be embedded
into the devices by attackers or such the device producers,
certain firmware processes (e.g., firmware update) are prone
to security and privacy risks [119]. For instance, since
the metaverse is a real-time environment, the delay for
firmware update might disrupt the operation and interaction
of metaverse devices, causing security vulnerability in
specific time intervals.
6) DoS AND DDoS ATTACK
Metaverse end devices often have limited resource and
energy, thus being prone to DoS attacks such as bat-
tery draining, sleep deprivation, and outage attack [120].
Furthermore, when attackers obtain access to a large number
of IoT devices, they can collude to conduct distributed
denial-of-service (DDoS) attack to overwhelm and disrupt the
metaverse decentralized infrastructure.
7) MALICIOUS INJECTION AND TAMPERING
Due to the immersive experience of metaverse, attackers can
inject harmful content in front of user avatar, harassing or
even committing crime to users who suffer mental issues [2].
Besides, IoT data from the corresponding devices could
be tampered to provide false information to the metaverse
system, impacting on other process such as computing.
8) THIRD-PARTY AND SPOF ISSUES
These issues often take place when the management system
of devices is centralized. If the centralized system is
attacked, this can impact to the entire management scheme.
Furthermore, third-party authorities can obtain sensitive
information from user devices, while it is challenging to
ensure that they always their activities in an honest manner.
B. THREATS TO COMMUNICATION NETWORK
As a paradigm of the next-generation Internet, the metaverse
can take advantages of current communication and network-
ing technologies such as 5G/6G,Wifi, Bluetooth, and Zigbee.
Thus, it is also vulnerable to a wide range of network-related
threats.
1) EAVESDROPPING AND MAN-IN-THE-MIDDLE ATTACK
Eavesdropping is a dangerous privacy threat in which
attackers can listen to private conversation betweenmetaverse
VOLUME 11, 2023 26275
V. T. Truong et al.: Blockchain Meets Metaverse and Digital Asset Management: A Comprehensive Survey
nodes. Consequently, the eavesdropper can further conduct
MITM attack to impersonate one of the parties in the
conversation. For example, the eavesdropper inserts itself in
a private communication between a metaverse user and a
metaverse application. Then, the attacker secretly relays and
alters the messages from the application to persuade the user
to give away login credentials, thus obtaining illegal access
to the user’s avatar.
2) NETWORK INTRUSION
Similar to access control attack at end-device layer, network
intrusion allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to the
metaverse network. Consequently, the intruders can carry
out further attacks on the network such as collusion, DoS,
eavesdropping, and MITM attacks. In general, network
intrusion can be organized through the use of phishing scams
or spreading malware such as viruses and trojans [121].
3) SYBIL ATTACK
In a decentralized peer-to-peer network, attackers can add
sybil nodes with many fake identities to gain the majority
of influence in the network, thus manipulating the net-
work [122]. This type of attack is often effective in reputable
system such as the metaverse reputation system presented in
Section V-C.
4) DoS AND DDoS ATTACK
At networking layer, DoS attack floods the metaverse
network with traffic and requests, overwhelming its capacity
and causing downtime. This can disrupt metaverse services
and prevent legitimate users from accessing the network or
services in the virtual world.
5) ROUTING ATTACK
Routing attacks such as BGP hijacking can be arranged to
redirect traffic to a different destination than intended [123],
thus stealing sensitive information of metaverse users (e.g.,
authorization, identity data) or causing communication
interruption (e.g., through routing loops).
6) MALICIOUS INJECTION AND TAMPERING
From networking and communication layer, the attackers can
capture, alter, replay packets and inject fraudulent packets
into communication links [120]. This can threaten severely
to the integrity of metaverse data.
C. THREATS TO COMPUTING AND STORAGE
With massive data needed to be processed, metaverse compu-
tation must be a proper combination of different techniques,
including both edge and cloud computing, storage. Although
end devices often have limited resource, their capacity would
be improved significantly along with the mature of the
metaverse overtime. Therefore, distributed computing based
on end-user nodes is also a potential technique for the
metaverse. However, there are awide variety of threats related
to metaverse computing and storage that must be overcome.
1) POISONING ATTACK
This attack often takes place in decentralized computation
schemes in which multiple nodes contribute computation
resource to a specific task. In this case, malicious actors
can intentionally submit wrong or random results to the
computing system, thus poisoning the computation outputs.
For example, random gradients submitted by malicious nodes
in a federated learning scheme can make the final model less
accurate, while the dishonest actors can still receive reward if
their action is not detected.
2) COMPUTATION DATA LEAKAGE AND INFERENCE ATTACK
On the one hand, input data for the computation process can
be leaked at storage and computation layer. On the other
hand, hackers can also attempt to infer valuable or sensitive
information from the computation outputs (i.e., inference
attack). For example, an attacker can steal the training data
of Deep Learning models in the metaverse, while he can
also collect the parameters trained on the model. Then he
uses specific mechanisms to obtain the data on which the
models have been trained. If the data contains sensitive
information (e.g., medical data), it would threaten the privacy
of metaverse users severely.
3) RESOURCE EXHAUSTION ATTACK
In centralized edge or cloud servers under the metaverse
infrastructure, attackers can organize resource exhaustion
attack in which consecutive resource requests are submitted
to consume the system’s computation resource, making it
slow or even unresponsive. Thus, it is crucial to construct
a reliable resource allocation scheme which can detect
malicious nodes and their abnormal resource requests.
4) DATA PROVENANCE ISSUES
Data provenance is the history of the origin, ownership,
custody, and processing of a piece of data, from its creation
to its current state. In a metaverse application that collects
user data, data provenance can help ensure that the data
is collected and processed in compliance with applicable
privacy regulations and user consent. However, the critical
issue in data provenance is to ensure the integrity of the
provenance, making it traceable and resistant to tampering.
5) MALICIOUS INJECTION AND TAMPERING
At storage level, if attackers can obtain illegitimate access
into storage environment (e.g., cloud storage), they could
tamper the data or inject fraudulent data into the system. For
example, the attacker can modify identity data of metaverse
avatars, preventing honest users from accessing their avatars.
6) THIRD-PARTY AND SPOF ISSUES
In centralized computation and storage systems, if the central
authority is hacked or they simply act dishonestly, SPOF
26276 VOLUME 11, 2023
V. T. Truong et al.: Blockchain Meets Metaverse and Digital Asset Management: A Comprehensive Survey
might occur and impact on the entire ecosystem instead of
certain specific failed nodes. Furthermore, trust management
in these schemes often rely on third-party entities, making
the computation system vulnerable when these parties stop
operating or provide malicious services.
D. SECURITY COUNTERMEASURES
1) BLOCKCHAIN-BASED SECURITY FOR METAVERSE END
DEVICES
Blockchain and smart contract can enable decentralized
access control schemes for IoT devices with enhanced
security [124], [125] and efficiency [126]. To this end,
Ding et al. [127] presented a blockchain-enabled access
control scheme for IoT devices, in which distribution of
attributes is recorded on blockchain to prevent SPOF and
data tampering. Access management is regulated by multiple
attribute authorities, who (i) play the role of consensus nodes
in blockchain network to distribute attributes to IoT devices,
and (ii) act as the key generation center to manage registration
of devices. The attribute authorities grant requested attributes
to devices via blockchain transactions, while only devices
with satisfied attributes can obtain access. According to the
performance analysis, when the number of attributes reach
30, computation overhead for the requester and the verifier is
about 100 ms and 250 ms respectively, which are acceptable
in access control systems. Security analysis shows that the
system can resist SPOF, collusion, and impersonation [127].
To make the access control system more decentralized and
automatic, the authors in [128] presented another scheme for
IoT devices in which access control is managed by a single
smart contract with configurable access control policies
(illustrated in Fig. 11). Communication between devices is
enabled by DTLS [129] to prevent spoofing and tampering.
Due to the resource constraint of IoT devices, the devices do
not join the blockchain network directly, but instead request
access from the smart contract through differentmanagement
hubs. Signed certificates is utilized to ensure the integrity
of these management hubs. A prototype is developed on an
Ethereum-based blockchain, while its security is analyzed by
STRIDE model [130], showing that the system is resistant to
DoS, tamper, and information leakage.
Besides access control, malware is also a potential security
threats to metaverse devices. The authors in [131] proposed
a blockchain-based malware detection system for Android
mobile devices using statistical analysis method. In [131],
a multi-feature model with fuzzy comparison method is
designed to analyze various malware families. Besides,
a consortium blockchain with personalized block structure
is deployed as a fact-base for malicious codes, storing all
malware detection results. Blockchain characteristics ensure
that the fact-base is transparent and secure, while also
providing evidence tracking of malware.
For secure firmware processes, the authors in [119]
designed a blockchain-based firmware update scheme for
embedded IoT devices, using blockchain to securely check
FIGURE 11. Securing access control based on smart contract presented
in [128].
the firmware version, validate the correctness, and download
the latest firmware update. To do so, the block structure
has been modified to include a new verification field, which
consists of firmware version, logs, hashing verifier, and
related information. The distributedmodel allows IoT devices
quickly check and download the latest firmware version,
thereby minimizing the vulnerable period and preventing
devices from firmware-related attacks.
2) BLOCKCHAIN-BASED SECURITY FOR METAVERSE
COMMUNICATION NETWORK
Network intrusion detection [121] is an effective mech-
anism to prevent a wide range of cyberattacks such as
DoS, ransomware, worms, backdoors, and man-in-the-
middle attacks [132]. Regarding blockchain-based intrusion
detection, the authors in [133] proposed a collaborative
intrusion detection model named Deep Blockchain Frame-
work. Specifically, multiple nodes in the blockchain network
collaboratively run a bidirectional long short-term memory
deep learning algorithm to detect network intrusion in
different subnetworks. The detection results and intrusion
alerts are then stored permanently on blockchain, enabling
a large-scale intrusion detection scheme with enhanced
accuracy thanks to the collaborative operation. The proposed
framework is assessed on UNSW-NB15 [134], a research-
oriented data set for network intrusion detection systems,
resulting in high efficiency and accuracy.
To prevent routing attacks in wireless networks, the authors
in [123] proposed a routing scheduling algorithm with
trust management based on blockchain and reinforcement
learning. In this scheme, nodes dynamically select shortest
routing paths thanks to a reinforcement learning model, while
routing information is stored on blockchain to offer data
integrity and traceability. Besides, a token-based incentive
mechanism on PoA blockchain consensus ensures that
malicious routing information would not be uploaded to the
blockchain network.
Regarding sybil attack, a blockchain-based framework for
sybil attack detection in wireless sensor networks is presented
in [135]. In this scheme, blockchain is used to manage
the state of sensor nodes in the network, in which any
VOLUME 11, 2023 26277
V. T. Truong et al.: Blockchain Meets Metaverse and Digital Asset Management: A Comprehensive Survey
changes (e.g., in location) will be recorded into blockchain
transactions. With continuous on-chain observation of node’s
status, a sybil node (which has the same identity with a
legitimate node, but different timestamp and connection) will
be detected when it tries to access the network.
3) BLOCKCHAIN-BASED SECURITY FOR METAVERSE
COMPUTING AND STORAGE
In terms of computation in the metaverse, smart contract
can be used to improve security of AI models [136] and
distributed learning mechanisms [137], [138]. The authors
in [136] utilize smart contracts to directly implement AI
algorithms such as Linear Regression, Naive Bayes, and
Neural Networks to empower the metaverse. By this way,
the ‘‘AI smart contract’’ can make cognitive decisions
automatically with trust establishment. This removes the
centralized parties and provides resistance to SPOF and
tampering. Besides, training data are stored on IPFS to ensure
integrity. Using up to $16 gas fee for each prediction, this can
be an acceptable trade-off in case the AI-based decision is
significantly important. However, larger and more complex
models will require much more resource and would not be
applicable in practice.
Besides, distributed learning models for the metaverse
can also suffer various threats such as poisoning attacks.
The authors in [139] proposed a reputation-based mech-
anism that prevents collusion and poisoning attacks in
FL by a consortium blockchain with contract-theory-based
incentive. Specifically, participant’s reputation is calculated
by a multi-weight subjective logic model, based on their
interaction history and frequency. Besides, a five-stage
worker selection scheme is designed to recognize malicious
candidates and avoid collusion attacks.
In terms of cloud and edge computing, blockchain can
be utilized as a countermeasure to resource-related attacks.
The authors in [140] introduced EdgeChain, a blockchain-
based framework for edge computing that resists DoS and
resource exhaustion attacks. The framework is built on top
of a credit-based resource management scheme, deployed on
smart contracts. If there are edge nodes making maliciously
consecutive resource requests, the smart contracts with
built-in policies will execute automatically to identify the
malicious node and reduce its balance. Since attack logs are
stored transparently on blockchain, these data can also be
used to calculate credit of edge nodes to actively prevent
future attacks.
E. PRIVACY COUNTERMEASURES
1) BLOCKCHAIN-BASED PRIVACY FOR METAVERES END
DEVICES
When users use wearable AR/VR devices in the metaverse,
these devices must collect their personal information for
different purposes such as construction of avatars and
profiles [2]. To protect data privacy of wearable embedded
devices, the authors in [141] proposed a ring signature-based
framework for privacy preserving of wearable IoT devices.
Blockchain is combined with ring signature protocol [142]
to enhance user privacy, in which the signatures are mixed
among groups (i.e., the ring) so that the identity of
signature’s owner is kept secret. Data privacy is further
improved thanks to a double encryption process with ARX
symmetric encryption for data and asymmetric encryption for
authentication.
In terms of device access control, the authors in [143]
introduced FairAccess, a privacy-preserving framework for
IoT access control management based on smart contracts.
In this framework, access control policies (e.g., ABAC)
are codified in smart contracts and triggered by FairAccess
transactions. Whenever necessary access control conditions
are fulfilled, the requesters will receive a token to obtain
access to the specific protected resource. This is done
automatically by smart contracts, thus eliminating data
leakage risks from third-party authorities.
Besides, location tracking is another major privacy concern
of wearable devices in the metaverse. The authors in [144]
proposed a privacy-preserving blockchain architecture opti-
mized for IoT devices, which can be applied to protect devices
from location tracking. In this architecture, IoT vehicles and
devices store location information in built-in storage that is
not disclosed to third parties. The owners can decide what
data can be exchanged, while communication in the network
is encrypted using asymmetric encryption to further protect
privacy.
2) BLOCKCHAIN-BASED PRIVACY FOR METAVERES
COMMUNICATION NETWORK
In terms of networking technology, the authors in [145]
proposed a blockchain-based authentication handover frame-
work for 5G networks with enhanced privacy protection.
In [145], the handover mechanism utilizes blockchain and
software defined networking (SDN) to transmit authen-
tication keys in 5G, thus eliminating eavesdropping and
third-party privacy leakage. Specifically, these data are
encrypted by blockchain-based keys, then divided into
multiple parts and transmitted along different paths as
programmed by the SDN controller. Therefore, privacy level
can be adjusted by modifying the number of transmission
paths, resulting in a trade-off for complexity.
At lower system level, eavesdropping in communica-
tion can be prevented by physical layer security (PLS)
technique [146], in which there would be relay operators
exploiting the physical layer properties of channels to
protect information against eavesdropper through proper
signal coding and processing. In terms of PLS, the authors
in [147] proposed a distributive auction scheme for PLS
based on blockchain and double auction theory. Firstly,
a blockchain-based incentive mechanism is designed to
encourage users participate in the distributed auction process
of PLS. Secondly, smart contracts help verifying bids,
preventing cheating such as multiple-bid submission and fake
identities.

FIGURE 12. Privacy-preserving federated learning framework for
industrial metaverse presented in [148].
3) BLOCKCHAIN-BASED PRIVACY FOR METAVERES
COMPUTING AND STORAGE
The authors in [148] designed a federated learning scheme
for industrial metaverses, using blockchain to prevent privacy
leakage of sensitive data. In this scheme, data collected by
IoT nodes are classified into sensitive and non-sensitive data
types. Illustrated in Fig. 12, while non-sensitive data can be
transmitted to higher-level systems for normal learning-based
metaverse tasks, sensitive data are kept in the physical space
to protect privacy. In the physical space, IoT edge devices
perform local federated training, then submit the trained
parameters to one of multiple subblockchains. Finally, all
learned parameters from subchains are aggregated in a main
blockchain, finishing a federated learning iteration. As a
result, privacy is protected efficiently since sensitive data are
all kept at the physical level.
However, the parameter updating process can also be
prone to privacy risks such as inference attack (i.e., attackers
attempt to obtain information from the learned parameters).
Weng et al. [149] proposed DeepChain, a privacy-preserving
scheme for federated learning, in which privacy is ensured
during the gradient collecting process. Specifically, after
a node finishes a local training iteration, it must encrypt
the trained parameters before uploading them to prevent
inference attack. A ZKP-based proof of correctness is
attached into the uploaded gradients so that participants can
determine whether the gradients are correctly computed,
while they can learn nothing from it. A collaborative
process among parties is required to decrypt the parameters,
while a blockchain-based incentive mechanism ensures that
the process will be correctly executed by the majority of
participants.
In terms of cloud computing and storage, Liang et al. [150]
proposed a blockchain-based cloud data provenance architec-
ture with enhanced privacy preservation, named ProvChain.
In this scheme, user privacy is protected thanks to an ID
hashingmechanism that only allows the data auditor to access
the provenance data, while identity of the owner is kept
secret and cannot be inferred from the recorded data. For
data privacy, provenance data are encrypted by the key pairs
generated by the cloud service provider.
VII. METAVERSE DIGITAL ASSET MANAGEMENT
This section describes the roles and potentials of blockchain
for digital asset management in the metaverse. There is a
need for a digital asset management system that guarantees
the rights of users and protects the platform from bad
content. In this section, we discuss an 8-stage workflow
for metaverse digital asset management integrating the
blockchain technology as shown in Fig. 13.
A. IDEATION AND CREATION
In these two stages, users firstly develop the ideas of the
digital products of interest. Then, they utilize tools suggested
or provided by the publishers to realize their ideas before
going through a series of stages to ensure the quality of digital
assets and the rights of the creators. During this process,
blockchain could enable a shared development environment
in which multiple creators contribute to a particular digital
content. For example, the authors in [151] introduced a
decentralized content creation platform for digital learning
using blockchain. In particular, blockchain is used in the
content development process, where multiple creators take
part in a permissioned blockchain. After a topic is created,
any approved participant could propose adding customized
content to the topic through the blockchain-based framework.
It makes the creation process decentralized and transparent
among creators. Furthermore, smart contracts can be utilized
for versioning control in the content creation process. A tree
structure of content versions is presented in [152] for tracing
the video source origin. In this structure, the original digital
content is stored in IPFS and pointed to by a smart contract.
Other creators could request to make another customized
version of the content and represent it as another smart
contract. The new content’s smart contract is considered as a
‘‘child’’ contract and it points to the ‘‘parent’’ contract (e.g.,
the source content), forming a tree-like model. As a result,
users can easily trace back to the source version of the content
from any branches.
B. CLASSIFICATION AND REVIEWING
The digital world could be affected negatively in both
legality and social acceptance if there are illegal, offensive
digital contents available in the platform. Thus, it is
crucial to construct an auditing strategy that can filter out
illegal contents efficiently. To facilitate the reviewing task,
several blockchain-based techniques have been proposed.
For instance, a platform combating against Internet of fake
media things is proposed in [153]. The authors introduced
a blockchain-based solution using PoA consensus to control
the source of news. In this scheme, whenever a piece of
news is submitted, it must be validated by a group of
validators selected by reputation score. Then, validators rely
on documents submitted by news organizations to decide
the eligibility of each news. If a consensus is reached and
the news is approved, a transaction containing the news
is committed into the blockchain. Otherwise, the news

FIGURE 13. The 8-stage digital asset management workflow in the metaverse.
considered as fake news and its publisher is punished by
reducing reputation.
Similar solutions could be adopted in the metaverse for
reviewing UGCs. However, the metaverse needs an efficient
system that can be applied for various types of digital content.
The authors in [154] proposed a decision making system
using a consensus algorithm based on PoA. In this scheme,
each decision is assigned a ranking score calculated based on
the total up votes and down votes of reviewers. The work also
shows that using the PoA-based consensus in the decision
making process could reduce processing time up to 5 times
compared to PoW algorithm, while the power consumption
is negligible [154].
C. ARCHIVAL AND DIGITAL RIGHTS MANAGEMENT
After a virtual content is approved, its associated files must
be stored in a specific database or IPFS for reservation and
further usage. Different storage solutions could be adopted
depending on the purpose of the creators and the type of
digital assets. Two types of digital asset can be defined based
on its usage and attributes as follows:
• Unique digital assets: This type of digital asset strongly
emphasizes the uniqueness and ownership of the asset.
A digital asset is valuable due to the fact that it is unique,
owned by the right owner, and other similar products
in the market, if any, are all illegal copies. NFT is an
efficient technique to manage this type of digital asset.
• Access-based digital assets: Uniqueness is not an
important factor for this type of digital asset. Instead,
these digital assets could be accessed by multiple users
who have registered or purchased license through a
digital rights management (DRM) system [155].
For access-based digital assets, storing source files in cen-
tralized databases such as cloud storage is a suitable solution,
since it is convenient to access the files and easy to enforce
access-control policies. A typical digital rights management
system for this type of asset is presented in [156] (Fig. 14).
In this scheme, digital assets are protected and distributed by
third-party authorities with an associated license. Therefore,
the traditional system is prone to SPOF and third-party risks.
To solve these issues, blockchain technology can be used
to provide a decentralized environment for the authorization

process and access management. Zhu et al. [157] propose
a distributed permissioned system using blockchain and
Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC) model for digital
asset access control. In this framework, a customer must
initialize a multi-signature blockchain transaction, then col-
lect four signatures from different ABAC-based components
to request access of digital assets. In comparison with the
traditional DRM model, this system is more automatic and
decentralized thanks to blockchain, while it is more flexible
thanks to the ABAC model.
For unique digital assets, tokenizing them into NFTs is an
ideal option compared to other traditional techniques such
as watermarking or fingerprinting. In addition, storing NFT
data using decentralized file storage techniques like IPFS is
a suitable solution which not only ensures the permanence of
data, but also protects data from unintended modification.
To tokenize digital assets into NFTs using IPFS, the source
files of the asset are first split up and stored in multiple IPFS
objects (Fig. 15). Each IPFS object contains up to 256 KB
data and a unique link and they will be stored by different
nodes in the network. There is also an additional empty object
that links all other objects, forming a single link of the source
file. Then, a metadata file is created and stored in IPFS,
containing necessary information about the digital asset such
as name, description, attributes, and the source file’s link.
D. DIGITAL ASSET VALUATION
After digital right management, digital assets are then ready
to be distributed in the market for trading. Another important
stage in the magenagement workflow is digital asset valua-
tion. According to the IEEE Standard for blockchain-based
digital asset management [158], the valuation of a digital
asset depends on the following factors:
• Future revenue: This is the potential revenue that a
digital asset could generate and it is marked as positive
cash flow.
• Future expenses: The operation cost that a digital asset
could consume. It is marked as negative cash flow.
• Price fluctuation: When a digital asset is distributed
into the marketplace, its price would increase/decrease
based on its platform and the market.
For digital asset valuation, blockchain could help in record-
ing the measurement of properties for digital assets [158].
For further usage, if the amortization of a digital asset has
been tested carefully and the owner has a valuation model,
the re-measurement of value could be done automatically by
smart contracts [158]. On the one hand, this eliminates the
role of centralized third parties, thus optimizing the profit of
these platforms and countering human errors. On the other
hand, smart contract code is fixed on the blockchain so
the pricing model cannot be changed. When users want to
adopt a new pricing model, another smart contract must be
constructed, resulting in additional fee and lack of flexibility.
E. DIGITAL ASSET DISTRIBUTION
The final stage in the metaverse digital asset management
workflow is to distribute digital assets to metaverse users.
Different types of assets should be distributed in different
channels based on their attributes.
For access-based digital assets, blockchain technology
could make the distribution process more decentralized by
eliminating third-party entity. Specifically, smart contracts
take responsibility for controlling the payment process and
granting customers keys or licenses to access digital products.
For instance, the authors in [159] present a blockchain-based
system utilizing smart contracts to distribute digital images
in a permissioned network. In this design, every watermarked
image is stored in cloud storage, while its hash is committed
to a scalable blockchain through transactions. Whenever a
customer wants to access an image, she sends a request to an
administrator smart contract through a payment transaction.
After receiving payment, the smart contract sends the session
key to the customer, allowing her to download the image from
the cloud storage. If the image has been modified in the cloud
storage, the customer can report the mismatch of the image’s
hash to the smart contract to receive her fund back.
For unique digital assets tokenized as NFTs, they can
be distributed on NFT marketplaces to take advantage of

the decentralized property. The structure and operation of a
typical NFT marketplace is presented in Fig. 16.
Since blockchain storage does not have query methods, the
dApp still needs a centralized database such as MongoDB
to update every change of the smart contract in real time.
When a user wants to take actions such as listing an NFT for
sale, she must approve the NFT marketplace smart contract
through an approval transaction, so that the smart contract
is allowed to transfer specific NFTs on behalf of the owner.
Through the front-end, she then calls the ‘‘list item’’ function
of the ERC-721 smart contract with the address of the smart
contract, the NFT’s token ID, and a desired price for her
NFT. After a new NFT is listed, the marketplace smart
contract emits an event, which is then listened by a third-party
oracle so that the new item is updated to the database. Other
actions such as buying items, updating price, canceling items,
or withdrawing funds also follow the above process.
VIII. OPEN CHALLENGES
There are many challenges to the development of the
metaverse that must be addressed in the coming years. While
research challenges and issues come from different backbone
technologies of the metaverse, we mainly discuss the ones
which related to blockchain technology, from both technical
and social angles.
A. SOCIAL CONCERNS
The potentials of the blockchain-enabled metaverse have
been exploited thoroughly in the study. Nevertheless, address-
ing persistent social challenges is crucial for enhancing
societal acceptance of the metaverse. Initially, the absence
of proper national and international regulations may result
in severe fraud, crime, and misinformation within the virtual
realm. Several solutions have been figured out to prevent cer-
tain cryptocurrency-related scams [160], in which blockchain
transactions and smart contract bytecodes are analyzed to
detect scams. However, existing solutions primarily focus
on mitigating phishing scams, while countering other forms
of scams and crimes, such as money laundering, remains
untapped. Additionally, some studies aim to address the
dissemination of false information on social media through
blockchain [161], [162], but the metaverse encompasses
a wider range and malicious actors can easily spread
disinformation through interactions between avatars.
Besides, the blockchain-metaverse alliance can pose
a significant risk to the environment due to its high
energy consumption needs. Some studies concentrate on
improving the energy efficiency of blockchain’s consensus
mechanism [163], while some others investigate using the
computational resources of the PoW process for meaningful
purposes such as deep learning and federated learning [164].
However, this could result in security trade-offs due to the
blockchain trilemma. Thus, further research is needed to
address the social implications of the blockchain-empowered
metaverse.
B. VIRTUAL ASSET VALUATION
There have been various extremely valuable virtual contents
issued and traded in the market. The Merge, an NFT
artwork created by the digital artist Pak, has been sold for
$91.8 million on Nifty Gateway [165]. That is also the most
expensive NFT ever sold, with 28,983 collectors pitched
together to purchase 312,686 parts of this NFT.
However, it is still vague in evaluating virtual assets.
There are already several NFT scams that raise the price
of worthless NFTs to very high values. In particular,
organizations issuing those NFT projects often associate
themselves with some existing successful projects, or they
create the artificially drive up demand by buying their owns
NFTs with high prices through different accounts created by
themselves.
When it comes to the metaverse, some traditional valuation
methods such as the DCF model and the Market approach
in the financial sector could be deployed as presented in
Section VII-D, but they all have their own weaknesses. While
the NVT Ratio in the Market approach could not predict a
bubble before it happens, the DCF model requires too many
assumptions in cash flow projection, thus being prone to
errors. The efficiency and accuracy of such methods have not
been verified concretely, thus virtual asset valuation in the
metaverse is still an open issue and further research must be
conducted to develop more suitable solutions.
C. CROSS-CHAIN VULNERABILITY
We have learned that cross-chain mechanisms enable
metaverse interoperability, allowing a global virtual envi-
ronment where users could send assets, messages, and
data across platforms. However, transferring virtual assets
between blockchains is actually not that simple. The oper-
ation of cross-chain communication has been described in
section III-D. This mechanism raises two serious problems:
• Centralization: The intervention of the third-party
operator eliminates the desirable decentralized property.
The cross-chain bridge is usually more centralized
than the blockchains to which it connects. Therefore,
attacking a cross-chain bridge is usually easier than
attacking the blockchains themselves.
• Put all eggs in one basket: Since all users must deposit
their tokens to a smart contract account, the smart
contract contains a huge amount ofmoney from different
sources and becomes vulnerable to attacks. In other
26282 VOLUME 11, 2023
V. T. Truong et al.: Blockchain Meets Metaverse and Digital Asset Management: A Comprehensive Survey
words, attacking a cross-chain bridge is usually more
lucrative than directly attacking the blockchains.
Many recent attacks have proven the vulnerability of
current cross-chainmechanisms. Poly Network, a cross-chain
interoperability protocol for Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain,
and Polygon, have been hacked in 2021. The attacker has
stolen $610 million within just 1 hour [166], making it one of
themost severe attacks in the cryptocurrency space. Similarly,
the vulnerability in centralization of Ronin Network, a bridge
between Axie Infinity and Ethereum, has been exploited, and
$650 million has been stolen by attackers [167]. This would
pose a threat to the economic system of the metaverse and
impact social acceptance of such platforms.
D. FINANCIAL RISKS IN MetaFi
MetaFi has been introduced in Section IV-C with a variety
of financial services provided to metaverse users. However,
the lack of central authorities could raise serious financial
risks in certain circumstances. In traditional banking systems,
our deposits in central banks are often guaranteed by the
government or its associated insurance corporations. On the
other hand, in a virtual and decentralized environment, almost
no similar insurances are available to protect customers from
financial risks.
Besides, volatility is a critical problem of using cryp-
tocurrency as a payment method in the metaverse. Although
stablecoins have been introduced as a solution for volatility,
there are still many issues with this technology. Stablecoins
are cryptocurrencies whose market values are pegged to
external reference such as fiat currencies, cryptocurrency or
other real assets such as gold or real estate. In fact, the
collapse of various algorithmic stablecoins has partly proved
its vulnerability. The crash of Terra project with the stablecoin
UST led to the loss of about $60 billion in the ecosystem’s
market capitalization [168], raising a warning for stablecoins
which are not fully backed by reliable assets. A critical issue
is how to prove that the organization proposing a stablecoin is
reserving enough real assets as collateral for their stablecoin.
In this case, the problem is back to the trust between users
and service providers, although trustless characteristic is one
of the most well-known properties of cryptocurrency.
E. BLOCKCHAIN SCALABILITY AND COST
The cryptocurrency system deployed in the Metaverse must
be as fast as possible to deal with the high demand of
the market. However, cryptocurrency and blockchain face
the scalability problem [169]. In a traditional centralized
system, user transactions and information are submitted to
a centralized server and all clients are implied to trust the
server. Therefore, the process is simple and fast. In contrast,
transactions in a decentralized network are spread throughout
the trustless system, thus complex mechanisms are needed to
reach the consensus among nodes.
To solve the scalability issue, we can use committee-based
consensus algorithm with a small group of validators
responsible for validating transactions. However, this means
that certain degree of decentralization must be sacrificed.
If this trend continues, the blockchain-basedmetaverse would
eventually evolve towards a centralized environment, thus
eliminating the benefits of using blockchain over traditional
financial systems. Another solution is to use layer-2 networks
such as channel, plasma, and rollups built on top of the
main chain which is used for the metaverse economic system.
Nevertheless, they add more complexity to the metaverse
currency system, while each of them still has its own
limitations. For example, a channel only allows interaction
between two nodes, whereas plasma has an extremely high
confirmation time, around several days or even a week.
Therefore, to be applicable for the metaverse, the scalability
of blockchain technology should be improved further.
F. THE EVER-GROWING LEDGER
Even if various proper mechanisms are deployed to improve
blockchain scalability and transaction rate in the metaverse,
one still needs to develop efficient techniques to store this
endlessly long history of transactions. With the huge number
of daily transactions submitted in the metaverse, the number
of nodes who can afford this large amount of data would
decrease over time. This issue comes from two technical
properties of blockchains:
• Blockchain is immutable, meaning that its transaction
history cannot be changed so it just grows up and
becomes larger over time.
• Blockchains are decentralised. Only those who keep the
full history of the ledger can validate transactions.
Several studies have attempted to propose methods to
prune old data from blockchain [170], [171]. However,
this eliminates the immutable characteristic of blockchain.
As blockchain is used in the metaverse not only for payments,
but also for storing data and digital assets, immutability is
indeed important. Hence, further inventions are needed to
tackle this issue to maintain the stability and prevent potential
risks related to decentralization and security in the metaverse
economic system.
IX. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented a comprehensive and in-depth
survey of the blockchain-enabled metaverse. Thorough the
study, the potentials blockchain has been shown in various use
cases of the metaverse, ranging from user application, system
perspective, to security and privacy enabler of the metaverse
infrastructure. Also, blockchain is often combined with other
technology such as IoT and AI to offer further advance
applications. That is to say, the integration of blockchain
into the metaverse is crucial to ensure the decentralization,
security, and privacy of this virtual world. However, several
issues with blockchain technology have also been identified,
indicating a need for further improvement before it can be
fully applied in the metaverse. We expect that our paper can
provide metaverse researchers and developers a clear vision
VOLUME 11, 2023 26283

of the blockchain-empowered metaverse, thus facilitating
further research in this burgeoning area.
For future research, the idea of a multiple-metaverse
architecture based on blockchain interoperability could be
developed further. To this end, all sub-metaverses should
follow a common design standard to be applicable with
each other. Finally, all current metaverse platforms would
eventually connect together to form a global virtual world,
in which each of them offers different sets of virtual services.
Moreover, further innovations are required to develop suitable
and efficient blockchain-based solutions enabling various
metaverse infrastructure functions and applications in order
to realize the full-flesh metaverse in the coming years.
