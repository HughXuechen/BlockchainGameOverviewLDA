Abstract. As an emerging technology and a factor of the era’s progress,
blockchain technologies have gained considerable attention in recent years.
Knowledge on blockchain technologies has become important for students.
Gameplay experiences foster learning as players accomplish game tasks in
virtual environments. In this study, we combine the “learning by teaching” and
“learning through play” to create a digital game-based learning environment for
learning blockchain technologies. This study proposes and evaluates an
innovative way of how the knowledge of blockchain technologies can be taught
via a role-playing game (RPG), or 3D animation and comic teaching materials.
To enhance the knowledge and literacy of computer science students, we
designed and developed an RPG teaching material using the flipped learning and
task clearance modes, which helps undergraduate students learn about and
improve their cognition of blockchain technologies.
Keywords: Blockchain � Role-playing game � Flipped learning � Emerging
technology � 3d animation teaching material
1 Introduction
1.1 Research Background and Motivation
Casey and Vigna [1, 2] pointed out that blockchain technology does not focus on the
opportunity to get rich overnight, nor does it aim to avoid too much government
control; instead, it is established to enable individuals to freely engage in financial
activities. The benefits of blockchain technology is to provide a decentralized
accounting method that subverts traditions, to significantly reduce the cost of trust, and
then, establish an economic organizational structure in the form of a new blockchain.
The applications of a blockchain include identity certification, medical care, logistics,
email, visas, and loans [3]. Blockchain has far-reaching impacts on the future of
students.

1.2 Research Purpose
Digital educational games are innovative teaching tools, and the stimulation brought
about by simulation helps students memorize more course contents [4]. The novelty of
this study lies in the development of blockchain topics in role-playing games
(RPG) through 3D animation teaching materials. In addition, a learning history analysis
platform is constructed to link educational learning with games, and the flipped
learning mode is used to apply game learning in teaching, which cultivates students’
autonomous learning ability and maintains high learning enthusiasm, thus enhancing
the literacy of business administration students in the field of information science in
response to the rapid rise of emerging technologies. The research purposes of this study
are to (1) develop digital 3D animation and comic teaching materials for blockchain
knowledge and application; (2) develop the task clearance self-learning system for the
blockchain game; and (3) develop teaching plans for blockchain education as the basis
for blockchain courses.
2 Literature Review
2.1 Blockchain
Blockchain is driving a new wave of data exchange and transaction revolution. Its
security and transparency make the transaction data credible. Through its operation
model without forgery or falsification, the data can be interconnected and utilized
without any concern, under multi-party authentication [5, 6]. The World Economic
Forum directly named blockchain as one of the potential technologies to promote the
fourth industrial revolution [7], making blockchain one of the modern emerging
technologies [8].
2.2 3D Animation and Comic Teaching
In recent years, the application of 3D virtual reality in education and learning has
gradually become common practice [9], as 3D virtual reality is characterized by the
provision of diverse learning situations [10, 11]. In addition, realistic 3D learning
materials help to improve the learning motivation and active participation of students.
Therefore, the 3D animation and comic teaching materials, as well as the fun-oriented
digital learning website system, are developed for classroom teaching.
2.3 RPG Task Clearance System
Crawford [12] suggested that games hold strong educational meaning, and that all
games are educational activities in a sense. Therefore, computer games have the
potential to be fun learning tools. As people can practice in the process of playing
games, it makes their instincts more intensive, and gives them an opportunity to
explore various possibilities, thus enhancing their cognition and control of self-identity
and environment, while developing individual personality and intelligence [13]. Lu
[14] proposed that the digital game learning mode should be used to introduce students
514 T. Weng et al.
to learning so that students are attracted to the goal-oriented problem-solving process
through game-based human-computer interactions. Provided with challenging home-
work and feedback, students can construct knowledge in an active manner and develop
their own problem-solving skills and creativity. In addition, the flipped learning mode
may serve to construct new teaching modes [15]. The effectiveness of digital games can
shape students’ cognitive abilities and expectations for learning.
RPG refers to games in which the players play different roles, where they com-
municate, trade, engage in combat, decode, and explore in a virtual game scene that
simulates a real-world environment [16, 17]. Liu, He, and Wu [18] suggested that when
RPG is applied in teaching, students can access the virtual game scenes and play their
roles. Moreover, as teachers and teaching assistants can also play their roles, leading to
interaction between teachers and students in the game, teachers can gain insight into the
learning effects of students in the task clearance game, promote the combination of
education and fun, and stimulate the students’ motivation to learn about blockchain
technologies.
3 Research Method
With the progress of computers and Internet technology, students can participate in
courses through various multimedia platforms such as online video and mobile devices.
However, the current traditional take-home assignments are mostly specified by
teachers, for students to practice. As these take-home assignments lack interactivity,
most students are less willing to learn and think; instead, they just wait for their
teachers to tell them what to do next. Furthermore, the traditional approach focuses on
standard answers that rely on memory for learning [19]. At present, the current
problems in the traditional take-home assignment method are classified into the fol-
lowing three points: (1) insufficient willingness to learn; (2) lack of active thinking
ability; and (3) lack of effectively applying the knowledge learned to solve new
problems.
RPG brings students novel experiences which enhance their learning willingness
and has positive impact on learning effects. This study develops a system that combines
a dynamic RPG system and static 3D animation to improve the understanding and
application of undergraduates regarding blockchain, and strengthen their ability to
interpret and solve problems through the integration of the task clearance application in
the task scenarios. By analyzing students’ learning processes, teachers can grasp their
learning process, understand their common mistakes, and take targeted reinforcement
measures in the teaching process to refine the teaching process. This study consists of
two stages of system construction and teaching experiments. In the first stage, the
course and teaching materials are designed, including course planning and design,
blockchain comics, and animation production. The RPG program system development
is the main goal in this stage. In the second stage, the above system is implemented in
teaching including the implementation of the teaching curriculum and analysis of
students’ learning effects.
Integrating the Combination of Blockchain and RPG 515
3.1 Research Design
Traditional classroom teaching cannot improve students’ willingness to learn, as
classes bore them. Blockchain is an emerging technology, and although not necessary
for all disciplines, its importance and necessity for undergraduates have been clarified.
Therefore, this study proposes two methods, static teaching and dynamic teaching, to
reverse traditional classroom education, enhance students’ willingness to learn, and
improve their sense of identity to blockchain.

3.3 Teaching Material Design
The design and development of course and teaching materials are based on Animaker,
which is a free online animation production website suitable for people without
experience in design and which does not require any monetary costs. RPG production
is based on the 11th version of RPG MAKER MV, also known as RPG production
master MV, released by the Japanese company KADOKAWA in 2015.
Production of 3D animation and comic teaching materials
The use of animation in teaching can make up for the deficits of traditional teaching
methods. By visualizing the abstract problem and making static pictures dynamic, this
method reflects the thinking process more concretely, broadens students’ horizons,
stimulates their inspiration, enhances their thinking logic, and integrates the traditional
teaching mode with animation and comics to achieve better teaching results. 3D ani-
mation and comic teaching materials are incorporated into teaching through digital
technology, making students interested and active in learning. In addition, flipped
learning can enhance their learning motivation and help form a positive attitude.

animation.

RPG Production Steps
1. Start the RPG Maker MV software and add a new project.
2. After adding a new map, use the material to design the map according to the
drawing mode.
3. After completing the design, switch to the plot mode, add events to specific areas,
and design the plot.
4. Use the workspace at the top to add background music and adjust character content.
5. Finally arrange the game on the platform, as shown in Fig. 3.
In addition to engaging students in the task clearance game, the course can teach
students to create RPG and give them the opportunity to develop their own ideas, better
understand how the game works, learn more tools, enhance their competitiveness, and
develop their ability to solve problems during the game production process.
Design Bottlenecks
1. Chinese fonts that displayed in game are inconsistent, as shown in Fig. 4 below.
Fig. 3. RPG production page
Fig. 4. Inconsistent game fonts and altered font
518 T. Weng et al.
2. Repeated cycle of events: in the original idea, a player has only one chance to
answer the question. If the player is right, he or she will receive a point; if wrong,
the score will be zero. However, after answering, the player can still repeatedly
enter the task and answer the question if they wish. In this case, “points” lose their
meaning.
Solution
1. Regarding inconsistent game fonts, in the Save Game folder, the fonts folder
contains the original font file. Users should search for other free Chinese font files
from the Internet to replace the original font file, as shown on the right side of
Fig. 4.
2. At the end of the first page of the event, set the self-switch A = ON, and add the
plot on the second page. In the conditional area, check self-switch A, as shown in
Figs. 5 and 6, respectively.
RPG Operations
Barab et al. [20] pointed out that in an immersive game environment, by the manip-
ulation of the virtual characters in the game and talking with other non-player char-
acters (NPC), the learning task transfer will produce more significant learning effects
than the framework of traditional descriptive or narrative textbook contents [21].
Brown, Collins, and Duguid [22] proposed the theory of situational learning which
argues that knowledge only makes sense if it can produce new knowledge and be
applied. Therefore, integrating blockchain knowledge into the game enables students to
apply what they have learned and learn more about the emerging blockchain tech-
nologies in a new situation. The character and plot settings are shown in Table 1.
Fig. 5. Set the self-switch A = ON. Fig. 6. Check the self-switch A.
Integrating the Combination of Blockchain and RPG 519
The process of playing our designed RPG:
1. After entering the game, the player sees the classroom screen and the game
instructions, as shown in Figs. 7, 8 and 9, respectively.
2. Then, the player enters the first task level, find any NPC, and start to answer
questions, as shown in Fig. 10.
Table 1. Character and plot settings
Characters Main characters:
Shelby: The main female character of the game, a second-year college student
Teacher Darren: Professor of the Information Class
Plots Shelby, who is a university student, went to bed late one Sunday after watching
a TV drama, and was late for the Information Class the next day, on Monday.
The teacher of the class, Darren, threw Shelby into the world of task clearance
RPG. Teacher Darren told Shelby if she cannot clear the tasks, she will have to
re-take the Information Class next year. Teacher Darren hopes that Shelby can
absorb the knowledge through the game and wonders whether Shelby can pass
the test
Game
rules
Each character of a BLOCK represents one task level which has a puzzle to be
solved; therefore, there are five task levels and five puzzles. The player answers
the related blockchain questions in the task levels. If the answer is correct, the
player receives a prompt and a gold coin. As the player correctly answers more
questions, he or she will receive more prompts and gold coins, and have a
higher chance of correctly answering the next questions, indicating that the
player is familiar with the concept of blockchain. Finally, the gold coins are
converted into players’ individual scores. There is only one condition to clear
the task levels; in the five task levels, the player must clear three or more task
levels to convert the gold coins into the individual score

520 T. Weng et al.
3. There are four answer options for each
question (A, B, C, and D), and only one option is correct. If the correct option is
selected, the player receives a gold coin. The players can press the ESC key to
check the number of gold coins they have. In Fig. 11, the correct answer is option
B; the player will receive the gold coin if he or she chooses option B, as shown in
Fig. 12. The number of gold coins is shown on the lower left corner of the screen as
shown in Fig. 13, where G stands for gold, (1G means one gold coin), and HP and
MP are the abbreviations for Health Points and Magic Points, respectively. They are
displayed on the upper right corner of the screen as shown in Fig. 13. In Chinese,
they correspond to the value of life and strength, respectively. The game sets full
HP to 450 and full MP to 90.
4. If the answer is wrong, the player does not receive a gold coin, as shown in Fig. 14.
5. After answering a question, players continue to find the next NPC to answer the
next question to receive a gold coin.

5 Conclusion and Suggestions
5.1 Conclusion
This study focused on the situational design of 3D animation and comic teaching
materials to be provided for students and teachers, to promote fun and vividness in
teaching and learning; and to simulate real life situations about knowledge of block-
chain technologies. As a result, we expected that students can be more involved into the
classroom teaching process to recognize the theories and applications about the
blockchain, and then will enhance their learning motivation and attitudes. Thus, this
study combined 3D animations and RPG to improve learning effectiveness in the hope
that it can trigger a far-reaching impact on education and create professionals in
blockchain technologies.
5.2 Suggestions
Suggestions for future research:
1. Explore whether the influence of the RPG task clearance system has significant
effects on learning.
2. Explore whether the difference in learning effects before and after the application of
the system established in this study have reached a significant level.
