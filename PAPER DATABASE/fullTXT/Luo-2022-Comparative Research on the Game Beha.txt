the capital provider and the capital demander would choose to cooperate with greater probability.When the cost of the blockchain
is gradually reduced, the two sides of the game choose to place the transaction information in the chain, which can improve the

1. Introduction
�eauthors constructed the incomematrices byusing chicken
game theory and income analysis theory, compared the game
behavior of the participants in the traditional supply chain
 nance and the supply chain  nance on the blockchain, and
compared the di�erence of the mixed decision Nash equi-
librium whether blockchain rewards and punishment were
added. When the rewards and punishment were added to
encourage the transaction information placing in the block-
chain, theNash equilibriumpointwould be further away from
the origin point. �e distance of the mixed Nash equilibrium
point from the origin is much longer, meaning that the
possibility of “cooperation” between the capital provider and
the capital demander increases from 1/5 to 3/5.�e di�erence
of the Nash equilibrium of the mixed decision showed that
when the transaction is included in the blockchain, meaning
that when the reward or punishment is added, the Nash
equilibrium is further away from the origin, and the two
parties will cooperate with a greater probability. �e research
showed that the probability of choosing cooperation is
strongly correlatedwith the degree of reward and punishment
trading information in the blockchain. By encouraging
trading information to be recorded in the blockchain and
improving the sharing degree of trading information, the
willingness of both parties to cooperate can be promoted.
�erefore, promoting the application of blockchain tech-
nology in the  eld of supply chain  nance and strengthening
the cooperative behavior of participants will be conducive to
the healthy and rapid development of supply chain  nance
and will better solve the  nancing problems of SMSE in the
supply chain.
China’s supply chain  nance has developed rapidly since
it was piloted in Ping An Bank (formerly Shenzhen De-
velopment Bank) in 2006, which has solved the  nancing
problems of many small- and medium-sized enterprises

(hereinafter referred to as SMSE) and greatly promoted the
healthy development of the economy. In recent years,
blockchain, as a new technology, has been gradually in-
troduced into supply chain finance. As an emerging FinTech,
it empowers the supply chain industry. Under this back-
ground, the authors took financing warehouse in supply
chain finance as an example and analyzed and contrasted
game behavior of the participants in supply chain finance
whether blockchain reward is added. (ey wanted to un-
derstand the changing rule of the game behavior and to
provide the reference for the application scenarios and
promotion of supply chain finance in the blockchain.
2. Analysis of Research Status
2.1. Overview of Supply Chain Finance and Its Financing
Warehouse. Supply Chain Finance (SCF) [1] refers to a
package of services such as financing, settlement, and fi-
nancial management, which design and provide for different
links of the supply chain. It takes the transaction with the
core enterprise as the risk control variable on the basis of
analyzing the transaction structure within the supply chain
and takes current assets such as inventory, work in process,
manufactured goods, and accounts receivable in the supply
chain as mortgage or pledge. (e logistics company will
supervise the collateral or pledge.
According to the pledges and their positions in the
upstream and downstream of the supply chain, the bank-
led supply chain finance [2, 3] can be divided into three
financing types: accounts receivable, financing warehouse,
and confirmation warehouse. In the supply chain, financing
carried out with raw materials, work in process, and fin-
ished products as collateral can be called financing ware-
house, as shown in Figure 1. (e demander of the financing
warehouse is the whole supply chain, mainly SMSE, such as
upstream suppliers and downstream dealers of the supply
chain. (e capital provider is the bank and its entrusted
logistics supervision enterprises. Banks, the core enterprise
supply chain, upstream suppliers and downstream dis-
tributors, and logistics enterprises sign the agreement. It
takes materials in the supply chain as the pledge. (e lo-
gistics enterprise is as the pledge mediation, issued the
pledge proves after receiving the raw materials, work in
process, and finished products as collateral, then the bank
provides capital to the demand side according to the certain
loan-to-value ratio, and the core enterprise takes its own
credit or repurchase pledge as collateral. Financing ware-
house is the most common way in supply chain finance. It
can partly solve the capital shortage problem of SMSE in
the upstream and downstream of the supply chain, realize
smooth production of the supply chain, increase product
sales in the chain, and improve the collecting reserves and
profits of banks in capital.
2.2. Research on the Game Behavior of Supply Chain Finance.
Many scholars have discussed the game behavior of the
parties involved in supply chain finance from different
perspectives, providing a reference for the business devel-
opment and risk prevention of supply chain finance. Du
et al. [4] built a game model to analyze the impact of supply
chain finance on the supply chain and the enterprises in the
chain and pointed out that supply chain finance, to a certain
extent, solved the financing problem of small- and medium-
sized enterprises, promoted financial innovation, and im-
proved the ability of supply chain to resist capital chain
fracture. Cao andMa [5] introduced default penalty number
and used the game theory method to solve and compare the
Nash equilibrium of the traditional accounts receivable
financing and supply chain finance accounts receivable fi-
nancing. (ey concluded that the supply chain financial
accounts receivable financing could achieve Pareto efficient
equilibrium, reduce the enterprise financing costs, and
increase the lending rate at the same time. Luo and Chen [6]

discussed the game behavior between the capital provider
and the capital demander in supply chain finance based on
the game theory and calculated the Nash equilibrium of
pure decision and mixed decision. (rough the example, it
was concluded that when the incentives and penalties were
added to the financing contract, the Nash equilibrium point
was further away from the origin, and the two parties would
choose cooperation with greater probability, which could
reduce the risk of supply chain finance. Wang and Zhou [7]
established an evolutionary gamemodel of banks and SMES
in supply chain finance, calculated and analyzed the in-
fluence of information sharing factors and blockchain
technology factors on the model according to the position of
equilibrium points, and then verified the reliability of the
calculation results through MATLAB data simulation
analysis.(e results showed that factors such as information
sharing incentive and blockchain incentive would promote
banks to choose blockchain supervision, while factors such
as information sharing risk and blockchain cost were on the
contrary. Finally, some corresponding suggestions were put
forward according to the results of the evolutionary game
model.
2.3. Research on Supply Chain Finance in the Blockchain.
Blockchain was originally built by Nakamoto as a digital
currency solution based on a distributed ledger. Blockchain
technology provided an imtamable data integrity proof in
terms of digital products, permission, finance, and other
aspects, which had a profound impact on the work and life
of human society in the era of big data and had landed a
series of application scenarios [8, 9]. Yermack [10] believed
that the low-cost, high liquidity, high accuracy, and high
transparency information provided by blockchain would
subvert the balance of power among managers, different
shareholders, intermediaries, and other participants,
forming a new corporate governance mechanism. Sabari
et al. [11] believed that the distributed ledger technology in
blockchain technology solves the problem of original in-
formation asymmetry, making the information among
multiple entities recorded and shared on each unit. (e
consensus mechanism of blockchain made the protocols in
the supply chain immutable. No node could unilaterally or
privately change the protocols and manipulate the data
among only a few subjects. Even if all subjects or a valid
percentage of subjects agreed to change the contract or
data, the original information would remain intact, and
new information would be recorded. Shunzi et al. [12]
discussed the application of blockchain technology in
cross-border payment and settlement, electronic loan,
supply chain finance, asset custody, and other business
fields. Chu and Gao [13] introduced the distributed ledger
of blockchain, encryption technology, and smart contract
into the business link of supply chain finance, which would
effectively promote the depth of transaction data acquisi-
tion by all parties, accelerate the speed of business iden-
tification and settlement, and improve the risk control
ability of financial institutions. Bai et al. [14] realized the
quantification, transmission, and transaction of contract
elements such as credit and reputation in the industrial
chain by building a digital system corresponding to lo-
gistics and applying a new supply chain finance platform,
thus forming a new framework for the development of
supply chain finance in the digital economy environment.
Guo and Chen [15] believe that blockchain technology
should be used to optimize supply chain finance to break
through the transmission mechanism of “information is-
land,” build industrial alliance, improve supervision and
reduce risks, and so on.
2.4. Research Literature Review. (e researchers at home and
abroad carried out a lot of research on the basic formof supply
chain finance, development obstacle, the main risk, and the
game behavior of participants in supply chain finance. (ey
thought that the cooperation and information sharing among
supply chainparticipants could reduce the risk of supply chain
finance and improve the profit level of each participant.
However, there were not many studies on the combination of
blockchain and supply chain finance; especially, the game
behavior analysisof theparticipantsof supply chainfinanceon
the blockchain was relatively less. (erefore, this paper took
the financing warehouse as an example to carry out the re-
search on the game behavior of supply chain finance on the
blockchain. It had certain theoretical research value and
practical guiding significance for the development of supply
chain finance in the new era by comparing the change of the
game behavior of the participants in supply chain finance and
the supply chain finance on blockchain.
3. Problem Description
As shown in Figure 1, the participants of traditional fi-
nancing warehouse mainly include capital demanders
composed of enterprises in the supply chain whose credit is
endorsed by the core enterprise; capital providers composed
of banks and the logistics enterprise entrusted by the bank to
supervise pledges. (e participants of the financing ware-
house on the blockchain have increased the blockchain
technology provider, but whether to introduce the block-
chain technology is mainly decided by the bank, so the
blockchain technology provider can be classified as the
capital provider, and the game subject can still be simplified
as the capital provider and the capital demander. Based on
the above definitions, the problems studied in this paper can
be described as follows:
Capital providers decide whether to lend based on
supply chain credit assessment. By comparing and analyzing
the game behavior of participants on traditional financial
warehouse and blockchain financing warehouse, people can
understand the changes of game behavior and provide
reference for the application and promotion strategy of
blockchain in the supply chain finance scene.

4.1. Game Behavior Analysis of Traditional Financing

4.1.1. Basic Assumptions of the Game Model
(1) 1e Game Participants. Banks and logistics supervision
enterprises shall be the capital providers. Logistics supervision
enterprises shall provide collateral supervision services
according to the requirements of banks and be responsible to
thebanks.Core enterprises of supply chain and their upstream
and downstream SMSE are the demanders of capital, which
take the pledge of raw materials, products in process, and
finishedproducts corresponding to the transactionbusinessof
core enterprises as the guarantee for financing. (is paper
analyzes the gamebehavior of the participants in thefinancing
position of supply chain finance based on the chicken game.
Chicken game, also known as a coward game, is a very im-
portant model in game theory. Suppose that there are two
people, A and B, who meet on a narrow road and both sit in
their cars waiting at the starting line; each party has two
options: back and forward. If A retreats, but B does not, and B
wins,A is a coward. If PartyB also chooses to retreat, thenboth
parties will be in a draw. If A does not choose to retreat and B
retreats, then Awins, and B is a coward. If both parties choose
to move forward, they will both fail. (erefore, for both Party
AandPartyB, it is the best result for the opponent to choose to
retreat while moving forward.
(2) 1e Game Behavior. (e capital provider is {cooperation,
betrayal}, and the capital demander is {cooperation, be-
trayal}. Cooperation of the capital provider means to strictly
supervise that the quantity, quality, storage, and trans-
portation conditions of the pledges of the capital demander
meet the requirements of the contract and ensure that the
pledge ratio is within a controllable range. Capital demander
cooperation refers to that the capital demander guarantees
that all the incoming pledges meet the initial requirements of
the contract and that the value of the pledges meets the
quantity requirements agreed in the contract and will not
take concealment or fraud and replace the defective ones
with the good ones, leading to increased risk of lending. (e
probability of capital supply and demand parties to choose
each strategy according to their own judgment is as follows:
the probability of cooperation of the capital provider is p, the
probability of noncooperation is 1− p, the probability of
cooperation of the capital demander is q, and the probability
of noncooperation is 1− q.
(3) Game Benefits. Parameter description: the loan interest
rate charged by the capital provider is αb, the regulatory rate
is rs, the operating cost rate is cs, the increase income of
betrayal is Us, the probability of choosing cooperation is p,
the probability of betrayal is 1− p, and the income of the
capital provider is πsπs. (e capital provider for each year
can be selling more products to the customer and need to
increase liquidity through loans D, assuming that the de-
mand increase revenue is Drd because of the loan capitals,
capitals demand rate of operating cost is cd, capital de-
manders earnings of betrayal is Ud, the probability of capital
demanders choose cooperation is q, the probability of be-
trayal is 1 − q, and capital demanders earned is πd.
(e payoff of the game is as follows: First, the payoff of the
capital provider πs � D(αb + rs − cs)πs � D(αb + rs − cs).
Second, in the financing supply chain, sales opportunities are
obtained through loan support, and Drd is the gross profit of
sales. (e total cost expenditure is the sum of operating cost
and financial cost expenditure brought by loan, that is,
D(αb + cd), and income is πd � Drd − D(αb + cd) �
D(rd − αb − cd).(ird, to simplify the calculation, if oneparty
cooperates and the other defies, the partner will have no in-
come, and the defector will have an increase in income.
(erefore, if the capital provider defies, its income is
πs � D(αb + rs − cs) + Usπs � D(αb + rs − cs) + Us. If the
capital demander defies, its income is πd � D(rd−
αb − cd) + Ud. Fourth, to simplify the calculation, if both
parties default, there will be no revenue, and the cost is the
operating cost of both parties. (erefore, when both parties
betray, the income of the capital provider is πs � −Dcs, and
that of the capital demander is πd � −Dcd.
(4) Game Information. (e capital provider and the capital
demander fully understand and comply with the contract,
understand their own behavior, and at the same time are
able to judge the other party’s basic situation and predict
the choice of strategy. (e capital provider can judge
whether the capital demander is cooperative from the
information on the goods in the supervised warehouse and
the information of the entry and exit of the warehouse. (e
capital demander can also judge whether the capital pro-
vider is cooperative from the arrangement of the capital
provider’s supervisors and the seriousness of the super-
vision process. In other words, the game information is
symmetric and complete.
4.2. Construction of theGameModel betweenCapital Provider
and Capital Demander. According to the above parameters
and assumptions, the profit matrix of the capital provider
and the capital demander is shown in Figure 2.
4.2.1. 1e Optimal Response of the Capital Provider.
According to the above parameter description, the proba-
bility of the capital provider choosing “cooperation” is “p”;
therefore, the probability of choosing “betrayal” is “1− p.”
(e probability of the capital demander choosing “coop-
eration” is “q,” and the probability of choosing “betrayal” is
“1− q.” Based on Figure 2, the expected returns of the capital
provider and the capital demander in the chicken game are
calculated.
Start with the capital providers. (e following are the
expected benefits of the “cooperation” and “betrayal” of the
capital provider.
(e expected benefits of the capital provider choosing
“cooperation” are as follows:
4 Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society
D αb + rs − cs( 􏼁q + 0(1 − q) � D αb + rs − cs( 􏼁q. (1)
(e expected return of the capital provider choosing
“betrayal” is as follows:
D αb + rs − cs + Us( 􏼁􏼂 􏼃q + −Dcs( 􏼁(1 − q)
� D αb + rs( 􏼁q − Dcs + Usq.
(2)
(en, the probability of “cooperation” and “betrayal” of
the capital provider was set as “cooperation p“> “betrayal
1 − p,” meaning that the probability of cooperation was
greater, and this was used as the equation to solve q.
D αb + rs − cs( 􏼁q<D αb + rs( 􏼁q − Dcs + Usq,
Dcs + Us( 􏼁q<Dcs,
q<D
cs
Dcs + Us( 􏼁
.
(3)
(is means that when the probability of the capital
demander choosing “cooperation” is “q< Dcs/(Dcs + Us),”
the probability of the capital provider choosing “coopera-
tion” is “p > 1 − p,” meaning that the probability of the
capital provider choosing “cooperation p” is 1. On the
contrary, when the probability of the capital demander
choosing “cooperation” is “q> Dcs/(Dcs + Us),” the prob-
ability of the capital provider choosing “betrayal 1 − p” is 1,
namely, “p � 0.” When the probability that the capital de-
mander choosing “cooperation” is “q� Dcs/(Dcs + Us),” the
capital provider can choose all “p” to deal with it. (e
optimal response strategy of the capital provider is shown in
Table 1 after the above three scenarios are summarized.
4.2.2. Optimal Response of Capital Demander. (e expected
income of the capital demander choosing “cooperation” is
D rd − αb − cd( 􏼁p + 0(1 − p) � D rd − αb − cd( 􏼁p. (4)
(e expected return of capital demander choosing
“betrayal” is
D rd − αb − cd( 􏼁 + Ud􏼂 􏼃p + −Dcd( 􏼁(1 − p)
� D rd − αb( 􏼁p − Dcd + Udp.
(5)
(en, the probability of “cooperation” and “betrayal” of
the capital demander is set as “cooperation q”> “betrayal
1 − q,” meaning that the probability of cooperation is
greater. And this is taken as the equation to solve p.
D rd − αb − cd( 􏼁p>D rd − αb( 􏼁p − Dcd + Udp,
Dcd + Ud( 􏼁p<Dcd,
q< cDd/ Dcd + Ud( 􏼁.
(6)
(is means that when the probability of the capital
provider choosing “cooperation” is “p< Dcd/(Dcd + Ud),”
the probability of the capital demander choosing “cooper-
ation” is “q> 1− q,” meaning that the probability of the
capital demander choosing “cooperation q” is 1. In contrast,
when the probability of the provider choosing “cooperation”
is “p> Dcd/(Dcd + Ud),” the probability of the capital
provider choosing “betrayal 1-q” is 1; that is, “q� 0.” When
the probability that the capital demander choosing “coop-
eration” is “p � Dcd/(Dcd + Ud),” the capital provider can
choose all “q” to deal with it. (e optimal response of the
capital demander is shown in Table 2 after summarizing the
above three situations.
4.2.3. 1e Diagram of the Optimal Reaction. An optimal
response diagram is drawn on the basis of parameter as-
signment in order to clearly show the optimal response of
the two parties of the chicken game involved in supply chain
finance.
Example 1. In a supply chain finance project, the operating
cost rate of the capital provider is cs � 4%. (e betrayal
income is the ratio of the capital demander to increase the
working capital D as the base, which is 16%. And the op-
erating cost rate of the capital demander is cd � 4%. (e
calculation results of Tables 1 and 2 are shown in Table 3.

According to Table 3, the optimal decision of the supply
and demand parties in the chicken game is shown in Fig-
ure 3, made by Excel.
4.3. Game Behavior Analysis of Blockchain Financing
Warehouse. In Figure 2, Nash equilibriums (dots marked
with circles) exist only in “cooperate • betray” and “betray •
cooperate” in pure strategy. However, when the range is
expanded to include mixed strategies, Nash equilibrium can
be achieved “with the probability 1/5 that both parties will
cooperate (or betray).” (e probability of the capital pro-
vider and demander choosing cooperation is very low, and
the main reason is to choose the betrayal of income that is
higher, meaning that when the trading information of the
capital provider and demander is not on the blockchain,
asymmetric information, there is no better technology or
mechanism constraints default behavior, the cost of betrayal
is low, and then the possibility of the game participants
choosing cooperation will be very low.
In order to improve the possibility of cooperation, the
capital provider timely introduces the new financial tech-
nology-blockchain. (e capital demander is required to
record all transactions on the blockchain. It will give full play
to the technology advantages of blockchain such as dis-
tributed bookkeeping, nontamper, openness and transpar-
ency, privacy protection, and smart contracts. By making
information more transparent, the cost of default will be
higher for both parties, and the benefits of cooperation will
be greater. At this point, it is equivalent to adding coop-
eration reward and breach penalty to both sides of the game.
When the capital provider or the capital demander chooses
cooperation, the upper chain reward is added; when
choosing to betray, they should be punished. For simplicity
of calculation, the amount of the reward is Dci, and the
penalty for default is Dcp (both are based on the loan
amount D). (e profit matrix is shown in Figure 4.
In this case, the calculation shows that when the
probability of the capital demander choosing “cooperation”
is “q< (Dcs + Dci + Dcp)/(Dcs + Us),” the probability of the
capital provider choosing “cooperation “ is “p> 1 − p,”
meaning that the probability of choosing “cooperation p” is
1. Similarly, when the probability of the capital provider
choosing “cooperation” is “p< (Dcs + Dci + Dcp)/(Dcs
+Us),” the probability of the capital demander choosing
“cooperation” is “q> 1 − q,” meaning that the probability of
choosing “cooperation q” is 1. Assuming that the other
coefficients in the above example remain unchanged,
ci � 4%, cp � 4%ci�4%, cp � 4%. Table 4 can be obtained.
According to Table 4, the optimal decision of the supply
and demand parties in the chicken game is shown in Fig-
ure 5, made by Excel, too.
When the transaction information of the supply chain is
recorded in the blockchain, the optimal reaction diagram of
reward through cooperation and punishment through be-
trayal changes greatly compared with the previous one. At
this time, the distance of the mixed Nash equilibrium point
from the origin is much longer, meaning that the possibility
of “cooperation” between the capital provider and the capital
demander increases to 3/5. (erefore, in the development of
supply chain finance, it can greatly improve the probability
of “cooperation” between the supply and demand parties by
stipulating in advance the incentive and punishment con-
ditions for the transaction information to be recorded in the
blockchain.

conduct an overall evaluation of whether the project can
introduce blockchain. (e competitiveness of the supply
chain, the stability of intrachain transactions, the compli-
ance of intrachain enterprises, the performance of logistics
supervision enterprises, and the information level of the
supply chain will be evaluated. (is is the basis for deter-
mining the rewards and penalties for adding transactions
recorder in the blockchain. (erefore, in the multiparty
agreement of the financing warehouse, the evaluation
standard of the up-chain project should adopt a relatively
systematic, multi-index, and whole-process evaluation
method. (ere are 6 things that should be considered: the
loan recovery, interest income, time point of recovery,
whether the value of the pledge can always meet the min-
imum requirements in the process of lending and payment
collection, whether the requirement is lower than the
minimum pledge rate in the process, and the times of its
occurring. Only by evaluating the process and results to-
gether can we effectively avoid the risk of the capital provider
and reduce the possibility of loss.
5.2.Determinationof theRewardsandPunishment Intensityof
Blockchain Supply Chain Finance. In order to introduce
FinTech blockchain technology into supply chain finance,
the optimal reaction diagram of the rewards and punish-
ments on the blockchain added from the above analysis has
changed greatly from the previous one. At this time, the
distance of the mixed Nash equilibrium point from the
origin is much longer, which means that the possibility of
both sides of the game choosing “cooperation” has in-
creased. (erefore, in order to motivate the supply chain
finance transaction recorded in the blockchain, adding the
rewards and punishments in the lending agreement can
effectively promote the enthusiasm of both parties, provide
power for the application of new science and technology,
increase participants’ willingness of supply chain finance,
and create better conditions for stable economic and social

(e authors took the financing warehouse as an example to
study the game behavior of the participants in supply chain
finance. By calculating examples, they compared and cal-
culated the game behavior of the participants in the tradi-
tional supply chain finance and the blockchain supply chain
finance. (e difference of the Nash equilibrium of the mixed
decision showed that when the transaction is included in the
blockchain, meaning that when the reward or punishment is
added, the Nash equilibrium is further away from the origin,
and the two parties will cooperate with a greater probability.
(e research showed that the probability of choosing co-
operation is strongly correlated with the amount of reward
and punishment trading information in the blockchain. By
encouraging trading information to be recorded in the
blockchain and improving the sharing degree of trading
information, the willingness of both parties to cooperate can
be promoted. (erefore, promoting the application of
blockchain technology in the field of supply chain finance
and strengthening the cooperative behavior of participants
will be conducive to the healthy and rapid development of
supply chain finance and will better solve the financing
problems of SMSE in the supply chain. In the future, in-
depth research can be carried out on the game behavior in
