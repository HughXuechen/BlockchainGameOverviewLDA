Abstract—Scalability has long been a major challenge of
cryptocurrency systems, which is mainly caused by the delay
in reaching consensus when processing transactions on-chain. As
an effective mitigation approach, the payment channel networks
(PCN) enable private channels among blockchain nodes to process
transactions off-chain, relieving long-time waiting for the online
transaction confirmation. The state-of-the-art studies of PCN
focus on improving the efficiency and availability via optimizing
routing, scheduling, and initial deposits, as well as preventing the
system from security and privacy attacks. However, the behavioral
decision dynamics of blockchain nodes under potential malicious
attacks is largely neglected. To fill this gap, we employ game
theory to study the characteristics of channel interactions from
both the micro and macro perspectives under the situation of
channel depletion attacks. Our study is progressive, as we conduct
the game-theoretic analysis of node behavioral characteristics
from individuals to the whole population of PCN. Our analysis
is complementary, since we utilize not only the classic game
theory with the complete rationality assumption, but also the
evolutionary game theory considering the limited rationality of
players to portray the evolution of the PCN. The results of
numerous simulation experiments verify the effectiveness of our
analysis.

I. INTRODUCTION
As Bitcoin [1] prevails in the cryptocurrency market,
blockchain has received explosively increasing attention from
both academia and industry, making the development of this
distributed ledge technology advance greatly. By employing the
decentralized cryptocurrency system, financial transactions can
be successfully conducted without the help and management
of third-party centralized institutions but all by distributed
blockchain nodes, providing transparency and manipulation-
proof experiences to users. However, there exists one major
disadvantage that it takes a long time to achieve transaction
confirmation among a large number of peer-to-peer nodes,
thus leading to the low scalability, e.g., Bitcoin handling
seven transactions per second, and impeding the large-scale
application of cryptocurrency in real-world applications. Even
though Ethereum operates with a relatively higher transaction
processing speed of 15 per second [2], which is still far below
meeting the needs in practice.
To solve this problem, the concept of payment channel
emerges recently to provide an off-chain transaction processing
method, which is established between two blockchain nodes
with each depositing a certain amount of funds for future
instant transactions without waiting the global on-chain confir-
mation. Only when the channel is closed, will the latest state
of the balance be published on the main chain. By this means,
the blockchain system can process transactions in an efficient
way. Further, with the help of Hashed Time-lock Contract
(HTLC) [3], transactions can be completed through multiple
channels even if the sender and receiver nodes are not directly
connected, forming the payment channel network (PCN).
Existing studies about the PCN mainly focus on systematic
performance improvement, including routing and scheduling
algorithm design to improve transaction processing speed [4],
[5], channel deposit optimization to extend the availability
of channels [2], [6], as well as security and privacy issues
[7]–[11]. Nevertheless, the node-level behavior and decision
inspections are largely overlooked, which turns out to be the
essential procedure affecting the formation and sustainability
of PCN, especially in the case of malicious attacks aiming at
exhausting channel deposits or isolating certain nodes.
In this paper, we analyze the PCN from the perspective of
individual node’s decision on whether to help in forwarding
incoming transactions for others, with the concern of potential
malicious attacks depleting the balance of channels during
the relaying process. Specifically, we employ game theory
to model the interactions between connected nodes with the
awareness of various channel attacks, and analyze the behavior
characteristics of nodes from both the micro (individual) and
macro (group) angles. Our study is progressive as the individ-
ual behavior is first investigated in the PCN game between any
two adjacent channels, and then the collective characteristics
of all channels’ interactions are uncovered in the evolutionary
PCN game. Our analysis is also complementary. Because we
study the equilibrium state and the powerful control strategy
of individual players, i.e., zero determinant (ZD) strategy, in
the realm of classic game theory with the assumption that all
players are wise and intelligent enough; then, we examine the
evolutionarily stable points and strategy by taking advantage
of the evolutionary game theory with the relaxed assumption
of ideal game players. In summary, our main contributions can
be listed as follows:
• We establish a game-theoretic model, termed as PCN
game, to capture the dynamic interactions between
blockchain nodes, based on which extensive analysis is
conducted to inspire better PCN system design.
• From the micro perspective, we study the Nash equilib-

the dominant ZD strategy regarding the unilateral control
of expected payoffs.

II. RELATED WORK
As representative PCNs, lightning network (LN) [3] was
designed for Bitcoin, while Raiden network [12] was proposed
as an off-blockchain scaling solution for Ethereum. Many
existing studies have been devoted to improving the transaction
speed and success rate in the PCN. Specifically, some of them
study the relationship between the topological structure and
the efficiency of transaction processing. The formation of the
PCN topology was analyzed in [13], which showed that the
centralized structure can make the PCN more efficient and
stable. Lange et al. [14] studied the attachment strategies’
influences on the PCN topology, which further affected the
connectivity and benefit of participating nodes. There is also
literature focusing on designing routing algorithms and transac-
tion scheduling mechanisms for a higher payment success rate.
A new routing algorithm for reducing the balance skewness of
channels was proposed in [4], which took advantage of both
the static and dynamic routing to improve the success rate
while decreasing latency and expense. Bagaria et al. designed a
multi-path routing scheme named Boomerang [5], which could
build redundant channels to eliminate the risk of participants
not performing transaction agreements.
In addition, the optimization of channel balance has been
widely studied because the depletion of one-way funds can
easily lead to the closure of channels and result in higher
costs for PCN nodes to re-establish channels. Khalil et al.
[6] proposed the first solution of rebalancing channels’ funds,
and Pickhardt et al. [15] continued to study the redistribution
of the balance to improve channels’ capacity, which laid the
foundation for processing more big transactions. Besides, Li
et al. [2] proposed an algorithm to determine the best amount
of initial funds put into the channels to extend the channel
lifetime and increase the number of transactions that can be
processed.
Recently, the security issue of PCN has received great
attention from researchers. Rohrer et al. [7] demonstrated
two attacks, namely exhausting channels and isolating nodes
attacks, where the detailed attacking steps were presented
with quantified success rates. Lu et al. [16] proposed a low-
cost attack named bank run attack which can significantly
reduce the transaction capacity to paralyze the whole PCN.
These attacks are based on the principle of griefing attack [10]
which is mounted by controlling a channel on the payment
path to refuse the contract and then locking the deposits of
each channel from the payer to the receiver for a period of
time. Harris et al. [11] presented a flood and loot attack by
creating multiple conflicting transactions, which may cause the
congestion of submitting arbitration to blockchain, and thus
the malicious nodes are able to steal the funds before the
victims receive arbitration results. Other studies are committed
to solving or mitigating malicious attacks in PCN. Banerjee et
al. [10] imposed a new HTLC protocol with a penalty on the
adversary to mitigate griefing attack, which has not been put
in practice because processing speed has to be sacrificed in
this solution. Some basic defense mechanisms against the flood
and loot attack was also presented in [11] although the authors
claimed that the attack cannot be completely eliminated due
to the function of HTLC. For various private properties of the
PCN, i.e., channel, balance, routing, and payment, Kappos et
al. [8] analyzed the potential attacks. Tang et al. [9] studied
the trade-off between the privacy and utility in releasing noisy
channel balances for the shortest-path routing mechanism.
Given the variety of attacks in PCN without effective control
schemes, the participation behavior of PCN nodes can be
unpredictable, which may negatively affect the formation and
sustainability of PCN. However, there exists no research on
this problem, thus driving this analytical study. Considering
the potential attacks aiming at reducing channel lifetime, we
model the interactions of PCN nodes and analyze both the
characteristics of individuals and groups so as to provide a new
perspective with some insights to enhance the system design
of the PCN.
III. GAME FORMULATION
To mitigate the challenge of blockchain scalability, payment
channels are established between two nodes to process transac-
tions in an off-chain manner. By using the deposits in the chan-
nel, both ends can conduct frequent transactions quickly. A
PCN composed of multiple channels allows payments to cross
the channel network under the condition that the intermediate
channels cooperate to forward transactions. Here we represent
the PCN as a graph G 〈V,E〉, where V = {v1, v2, · · · , vN}
denotes the set of nodes with N denoting the total number
of blockchain nodes in the PCN and E = {e1, e2, · · · , eK}
denotes the set of payment channels with K being the total
number of channels. An exemplary PCN is illustrated in Fig. 1.
Each intermediate node can decide whether to use its own
existing channel with limited deposit to assist in forwarding
others’ transactions. Considering that forwarding transactions
is via a concrete channel which has a certain amount of deposit

represent the deposits invested by blockchain nodes, which can be used to
conduct instant transactions between the connected nodes.
available to be used for transactions, we focus on the action of
each node in terms of deciding whether to forward a coming
transaction through a specific channel or not. In detail, we
consider the interactions between any pair of adjacent channels
with the choices of cooperation and defection, denoted as C
and D, respectively, which can be modeled as a two-player
game. Here the channel choosing strategy C will participate in
forwarding transactions to help complete transactions between
non-adjacent nodes, while the channel with strategy D will
refuse to forward the coming transactions and only use the
deposits to meet its own transaction needs.
Clearly, different behaviors bring different payoffs to the
channels in the PCN. To capture all possible situations, we
define the parameters affecting any channel ek’s payoff as:
• Natural profit (denoted as rk): Compared with process a
transaction on the blockchain, using the payment channel
can reduce block packing cost and time delay for com-
mitting the transaction to the main chain, which is defined
as the natural profit of a channel.
• Profit from helping relay transactions (fk): When ek
chooses strategy C, assisting in routing a neighbor’s trans-
actions, it obtains some profits by collecting transaction
fees from the forwarded transactions.
• Profit from transactions being relayed by a neighbor (ak):
When ek’s neighboring channel cooperates in relaying
transactions from ek, it can benefit from reducing the cost
of sending these transactions on-chain.
• Loss of being attacked (ck): General attacks include but
are not limited to denial-of-service, channel exhaustion,
and node isolation, which result in cooperative channels’
funds being locked for a period of time or even being
terminated, thus leading to economic loss.
For the simplicity and brevity of expression, we consider
two adjacent channels ex, ey ∈ E, which have a point of
intersection node in the PCN. Both ex and ey can select
either C or D, which respectively means that they will relay
transactions for each other or not. The four strategy combi-
nations for channels ex and ey generate different payoffs as
follows: (i) When ex and ey cooperate concurrently, they both
obtain transaction fees and payoffs from their own transactions
being relayed. And they also need to bear the potential losses
caused by malicious attacks. Thus, ex and ey obtain payoffs
rx + fx + ax − cx and ry + fy + ay − cy , respectively; (ii)
if ex chooses cooperation while ey chooses defection, ex does
not get the benefit of transaction demand being satisfied by ey ,
and ey can not collect transaction fees but avoid potential loss
cy , so ex can obtain rx+fx − cx while ey has payoff ry+ay;
(iii) on the contrary, when ex defects but ey cooperates, ex
obtains rx + ax and ey gains ry + fy − cy; and (iv) in the
case that both ex and ey choose defection, they cannot meet
transaction needs of each other, so they only have the basic
payoffs rx and ry . Subsequently, channels’ payoff vectors can
be denoted as follows:

Definition III.1 (PCN game). In the PCN game, any two
adjacent channels ex and ey as players can choose strategies
C and D, indicating whether participating in forwarding
transactions or not, and get payoffs Sx and Sy , respectively.
In the following, we first study the problem of dominant
interest in the interactions between any pair of channels from
a micro perspective, which can reveal some clues about the
optimal actions of individual players in the PCN game. After
that, we study the evolution process of the PCN game from a
macro perspective to show the overall behavior trend, which
may help us understand the collective characteristics of the
PCN and thus direct us to better design and use it.

IV. MICROCOSMIC ANALYSIS OF THE PCN GAME
In this section, we study the interactions between any two
adjacent channels in the PCN game as defined above from
a microcosmic perspective. Specifically, we first analyze the
Nash equilibrium of the PCN game, and then investigate a
powerful control strategy.
A. Nash equilibrium
Given the payoff matrix defined in the above section, we
can derive the Nash equilibrium in three different parameter
cases.
Theorem IV.1. When cx < fx and cy < fy , a Nash
equilibrium is reached when both ex and ey choose strategy
C.
Proof. To derive the Nash equilibrium in the two-player game,
we can start from focusing on the best action of one of the
players. In our problem, we first study the optimal strategy of
channel ex by considering all possible actions of ey . When
ey chooses strategy C, ex’s payoff of choosing strategy C
is more than that of strategy D since rx + fx + ax − cx >
rx+ax given the condition cx < fx. When ey chooses strategy
D, ex’s payoff of choosing strategy C is more than that of
strategy D according to rx + fx − cx > rx. Thus, no matter
channel ey chooses strategy C or D, ex prefers cooperation to
obtain the best payoff. In the same way, we can conclude that
ey will choose cooperation for more payoffs. Therefore, both
players in the game choosing cooperation constitutes a Nash
equilibrium.
Theorem IV.2. When cx > fx and cy > fy , there is a Nash
equilibrium when both channels choose strategy D.
The proof of Theorem IV.2 is similar to that of Theorem
IV.1. For the sake of brevity, we omit the details here.
B. Control analysis of the zero-determinant strategy
The emergence of the zero-determinant (ZD) strategy allows
a player to unilaterally enforce a linear relationship between the
payoffs of its own and the opponent, regardless of the opponent
strategy [17]. In the PCN, since a large number of transactions
need to be processed, there are long-term interactions between
channels, and the result of strategy choice will leave an
impact on the next round of interaction. Under the condition
of ex and ey choosing strategy profile (CC,CD,DC,DD)
in the previous round, we define ex’s mixed strategy as
p = (p1, p2, p3, p4), where each component represents the
probability of choosing cooperation correspondingly. And ey’s
mixed strategy is denoted as q = (q1, q2, q3, q4) analogously.
With the above definitions of p and q, the process of the
repeated game can be regarded as a Markov decision process,
and its transition matrix M is expressed as
M =
⎡⎢⎣p1q1 p1(1− q1) (1− p1)q1 (1− p1)(1− q1)
p2q3 p2(1− q3) (1− p2)q3 (1− p2)(1− q3)
p3q2 p3(1− q2) (1− p3)q2 (1− p3)(1− q2)
p4q4 p4(1− q4) (1− p4)q4 (1− p4)(1− q4)
⎤⎥⎦ . (3)
Let v be the stable vector of the above transition matrix.
According to [17], after the determinant elementary transfor-
mation and based on Cramer’s rule, the dot product of v and
any vector f = (f1, f2, f3, f4) is
v · f = D(p,q, f)
= det
⎡⎢⎢⎣
−1 + p1q1 −1 + p1 −1 + q1 f1
p2q3 −1 + p2 q3 f2
p3q2 p3 −1 + q2 f3
p4q4 p4 q4 f4
⎤⎥⎥⎦. (4)
Besides, the expected payoffs of channels ex and ey can be
calculated as follows:
Ex =
v · Sx
v · 1 =
D(p,q,Sx)
D(p,q,1)
,
Ey =
v · Sy
v · 1 =
D(p,q,Sy)
D(p,q,1)
,
(5)
where 1 is a unit vector with four elements being 1. We can
find the payoffs in (5) are linearly related with their payoff
vectors. Hence, when computing a linear combination of the
above two expected payoffs, with α, β, and γ being constant
parameters, we have
αEx + βEy + γ =
v · (αSx + βSy + γ1)
v · 1
=
D(p,q, αSx + βSy + γ1)
D(p,q,1)
.
(6)
And (6) can be calculated by substituting f in (4) with
αSx+βSy+γ1 in the numerator and 1 in the denominator. By
observing (4), we can realize that the second and third columns
of the determinant are only related to the strategies of ex and
ey , respectively, which means both ex and ey are capable
of choosing strategies to make one column proportional to
f , resulting in the determinant being zero. Taking ex as an
example, if its strategy p makes the second column of (4)
proportionate to αSx + βSy + γ1, then the numerator in (6)
becomes zero. Therefore, the linear combination of the two
payoffs, i.e., αEx + βEy + γ = 0, is established. Without the
loss of generality, we continue to assume that ex uses the ZD
strategy as an exemplary case in the following.
1) ex unilaterally sets ey’s payoff: When α = 0, Ey =
−γ/β holds, which means that ex’s strategy p makes the
second column of (4) equal to βSy + γ1, ex can unilaterally
set ey’s expected payoff Ey . Specifically, p can be solved by
the following four equations,
⎧⎪⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎪⎩
p1 = 1 + β(ry + fy + ay − cy) + γ
p2 = 1 + β(ry + ay) + γ
p3 = β(ry + fy − cy) + γ
p4 = βry + γ
. (7)
300

Then p2 and p3 can be resolved with p1 and p4 to eliminate
parameters β and γ,
p2 =
p1(S
2
y − S4y)− (1 + p4)(S2y − S1y)
S1y − S4y
=
p1ay − (1 + p4)(cy − fy)
fy + ay − cy ,
p3 =
(1− p1)(S4y − S3y) + p4(S1y − S3y)
S1y − S4y
=
(1− p1)(cy − fy) + p4ay
fy + ay − cy .
(8)
So ey’s expected payoff is:
Ey =
(1− p1)ry + p4(ry + fy + ay − cy)
(1− p1) + p4 . (9)
Now we discuss the controlling results of the ZD strategy with
different parameter settings.
Theorem IV.3. When cy < fy , we divide the situation in two
cases according to the relationship between fy−ay and cy: (i)
When cy > fy−ay , ex can control Ey ∈ [ry+fy−cy, ry+ay];
(ii) if cy ≤ fy − ay , ex cannot set Ey’s range unilaterally.
Proof. By observing (9), Ey is the weighted average of ry and
ry+fy+ay−cy , and the weights are 1−p1 and p4 respectively.
We can re-express Ey as ry+
fy+ay−cy
1+λ with λ = 1−p1
p4
, since
both p1 and p4 belong to (0,1), λ cannot be negative. Under
the condition of cy < fy , p2 ≥ 0 and p3 ≤ 1 are satisfied
with any feasible p1 and p4. Subsequently, we calculate the
constraints p2 ≤ 1 and p3 ≥ 0, and obtain{
λ ≥ fy−cy
ay
λ ≤ ay
fy−cy
.
When cy > fy − ay , λ has solutions and Ey is inversely pro-
portional to λ. So we get the maximum Ey when λ =
fy−cy
ay
,
and the minimum Ey with λ =
ay
fy−cy
. While if cy ≤ fy − ay
there is not a feasible solution or no more than one fixed value,
therefore ex cannot control Ey’s range.
Theorem IV.4. When cy > fy+ay , ex cannot unilaterally set
Ey’s range.
Proof. According to (8), 0 ≤ p2, p3 ≤ 1 can only be met at
a single point of p = (1, 1, 0, 0) in the case of cy > fy + ay .
Thus, ex cannot control Ey’s range.
Theorem IV.5. In the case of fy < cy < fy + ay , when
p4 ∈ (0, ay+fy−cy
cy−fy+ay
), Ey has the minimum value of ry +
p4ay
1+p4
;
if p4 ∈ ( ay+fy−cy
cx−fx+ax
,
ay+fy−cy
ay
), Ey has the minimum value of
ry+
p4(cy−fy)
1−p4
. In addition, Ey is ry when p4 = 0 and p1 �= 1,
and Ey has a maximum value of ry+fy+ay−cy when p1 = 1
and p4 �= 0.
Proof. Because of ry < ry+fy+ay−cy in this case, the larger
λ is, the smaller Ey is. To derive the minimum value of Ey ,
we need to calculate the maximum of λ under the constraints
of p1, p2, p3 and p4 belonging to [0,1]. For any feasible p1
and p4, two inequalities are naturally satisfied, i.e., p2 ≤ 1
and p3 ≥ 0. Thus, we only need to focus on the conditions of
making p2 ≥ 0 and p3 ≤ 1, which leads to{
λ ≤ ay+fy−cy
ayp4
− cy−fy
ay
λ ≤ ay+fy−cy
(cy−fy)p4
− ay
cy−fy
.
Because these two inequalities need to be satisfied at the same
time, we need to compare the values of two expressions on the
right side of the inequalities and take the smaller one as the
maximum value of λ. Subtracting the second expression from
the first one, we can get a function of p4 that can be expressed
as f(p4) =
cy−fc−ay
ay(cy−fy)
(
fy+ay−cy
p4
+fy −ay − cy). Since λ ≥ 0,
we can derive the domain of f(p4) as p4 ∈ (0,
ay+fy−cy
ay
).
By calculating the first derivative of f(p4), we can obtain that
f(p4) is a monotonically increasing function with a zero point
p4 =
ay+fy−cy
cx−fx+ax
, which means when p4 ∈ (0, ay+fy−cy
cy−fy+ay
), we
have f(p4) ≤ 0, and thus the first inequality limits a smaller
value of λ; while if p4 ∈ ( ay+fy−cy
cx−fx+ax
,
ay+fy−cy
ay
), f(p4) ≥ 0
and we know that the second inequality becomes the limits
of lambda. Given the maximum λ, we can get Ey’s minimum
value as ry +
p4ay
1+p4
and ry +
p4(cy−fy)
1−p4
. Finally, two special
cases are considered. When p4 = 0 and p1 �= 1, according
to (9), there exists Ey = ry . And when p1 = 1 and p4 �= 0,
which means λ = 0, we have Ey with a maximum value of
ry + fy + ay − cy .
2) ex tries to set its own payoff: Specifically, ex may set
β = 0, yielding Ex = −γ/α. In this way, ex can set its
own expected payoff unilaterally without any impact of ey’s
strategy. Through the analogous calculation with the second
column of (4) equal to αSx + γ1, we can express p2 and p3
with p1 and p4 as follows
p2 =
(1 + p4)(S
1
x − S2x)− p1(S4x − S2x)
S1x − S4x
=
(1 + p4)ax − p1(cx − fx)
fx + ax − cx ,
p3 =
−(1− p1)(S3x − S4x)− p4(S3x − S1x)
S1x − S4x
=
−(1− p1)ax − p4(cx − fx)
fx + ax − cx .
(10)
By calculating the expressions of α and γ, we have
Ex =
(1− p1)rx + p4(rx + fx + ax − cx)
(1− p1) + p4 . (11)
Then we consider the scope limitation under different param-
eter cases.
Theorem IV.6. When cx < fx, we can derive two types of
results according to the relationship between fx − ax and cx:
(i) When cx < fx − ax, ex can control Ex ∈ [rx + ax, rx +
fx − cx]; (ii) in the case of cx ≥ fx − ax, ex cannot set the
range of Ex unilaterally.

Theorem IV.7. When cx > fx + ax, if p4 ∈ (0, cx−fx−ax
cx−fx+ax
),
the maximum of Ex is rx +
p4(cx−fx)(fx+ax−cx)
(1+p4)(cx−fx−ax)
, while if
p4 ∈ ( cx−fx−ax
cx−fx+ax
, cx−fx−ax
cx−fx
), the maximum of Ex is rx +
p4ax(fx+ax−cx)
(1−p4)(cx−fx)−ax
. And in the case of p1 = 1, p4 �= 0, the
minimum value of Ex is rx+fx+ax−cx, and if p4 = 0, p1 �= 1,
the maximum value of Ex is rx.
Theorem IV.8. When fx < cx < fx + ax, ex cannot
unilaterally set its own payoff range.
The proofs of the above three theorems are similar to
those of Theorems IV.3-IV.5, which are omitted here to avoid
redundancy.
3) Experimental evaluation: To evaluate the control power
of the ZD strategy, we conduct a series of simulations to
study the impact of payoff parameters on the payoff range
and report the results in Figs. 3-6. When ex sets ey’s payoff,
we set ry, fy, ay, and cy as 2, 1.5, 1.2 and 0.9, respectively,
to testify Ey’s range when cy < fy and cy > fy − ay hold
in Theorem IV.3, where the experimental results are shown in
Fig. 3. We can see from Fig. 3(a) that Ey’s range is [2.6, 3.2],
which satisfies the boundary range given by λ. We set Ey as
0 when p2 /∈ [0, 1] or p3 /∈ [0, 1], to distinguish the effective
range that ex can control. The two subgraphs in the first row
of Fig. 3(b) show the change of Ey with p4 when p1 = 0.4
and p1 = 0.8 respectively, and the second row indicates the
effect of p1 on Ey when p4 = 0.2 and p4 = 0.6 respectively.
Via adjusting cy to 1.8, Fig. 4(a) shows the payoff range
of ey that ex can control under the condition of fy < cy <
fy + ay . Fig. 4(b) is with the same setting as Fig. 3(b). Based
on the experimental results, when p4 ∈ (0, 0.6), Ey has the
minimum value of 2 + 1.2p4
1+p4
; when p4 ∈ (0.6, 0.75), Ey has
the minimum value of 2 + 0.3p4
1−p4
. And when p4 = 0, p1 �= 1,
Ey reaches the minimum 2; when p1 = 1, p4 �= 0, Ey obtains
the maximum 2.9.
Fig. 5(a) shows that when ex uses the ZD strategy to control
its own payoff, where we set ry, fy, ay, and cy as 2, 1.5, 1.2
and 0.06, so that cx < fx and cx < fx − ax hold. According
to the experimental results, the range of Ex is [3.2,3.44]. And
Fig. 5(b) shows the range of Ex when p1 = 0.4, p1 = 0.8,
p4 = 0.2, and p4 = 0.6. As shown in Fig. 6(a), when we
set cx as 3 so that cx > fx + ax is satisfied as mentioned in
Theorem IV.7, the maximum value of Ex is 2− p4
6(1+p4)
when
p4 ∈ (0, 19 ), and the maximum value of Ex is 2− 1.2p4
1−p4
when
p4 ∈ ( 19 ,
1
5 ). And in the case of p1 = 1, p4 �= 0, there is a
minimum payoff of 1.7, while if p4 = 0, p1 �= 1, Ex has a
maximum value of 2. In this case, the feasible region of Ex is
small, so we fix p1 as 0.9 and 1, p4 as 0 and 0.1 in Fig. 6(b)
to show the change of Ex.
In the cases of other parameters discussed, including the
case of cy < fy −ay in Theorem IV.3, Theorem IV.4, the case
of cx ≥ fx − ax in Theorem IV.6, and Theorem IV.8, Ey and
Ex, which cannot be controlled in a range, so we do not show
their results here.

V. MACROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF THE PCN GAME
Generally, since there are a number of channels in the
PCN, they can be regarded as a population, where each
channel interacts with the adjacent channels in a continuous
manner. By investigating the large number of two-player PCN
games between each pair of adjacent channels, we can study
the evolution of the whole population with the help of the
evolutionary game theory, which is termed as the evolutionary
PCN game. Specifically, we analyze the state that the entire
population can reach from two aspects: replication dynamic
analysis and the evolutionary stability of the ZD strategy.
A. Replication dynamic analysis
A channel is defined as an evolutionary player if it adjusts
strategy according to some optimization scheme to maximize
its payoff. In this paper, we use Fermi evolutionary rule [18],
[19] as an update rule of channels’ strategies, which is based
on the assumption that players’ strategies in an evolutionary
game obtain more payoffs by imitating neighbors’ strategies
and converging to a stable state. The specific manifestation
of this rule is that all the channels in the evolutionary PCN
game, randomly select one adjacent channel to compare their
payoffs and decide whether or not to learn this neighbor’s
strategy after each round of game. Following the update rule,
the final channels’ payoffs and strategies reach a stable state.
In this case, we want to figure out what state the channels will
converge to during the evolution process and the effect of the
parameters on the stable state.
The replication dynamics can well describe how players in
a game gradually achieve the stability of their strategies by
imitating and learning the strategies of their opponents. In
the following, we use this method to study the stable state
of strategies in the evolutionary PCN game.

We assume that θ is the percentage of channels choosing
the cooperation strategy and then 1 − θ is the percentage of
channels adopting the defection strategy. In other words, in
the evolutionary PCN game, the probability of each participant
channel, e.g., ez , encountering the opponent with the strategy
C is θ, and the probability of encountering the opponent with
the strategy D is 1 − θ. We define the payoff vector of ez
as Sz = (S
1
z , S
2
z , S
3
z , S
4
z )
�, corresponding to the payoff of ez
when the strategy combinations of ez and its opponent are
(CC,CD,DC,DD), which can be similarly defined accord-
ing to (1),
Sz =
⎡⎢⎢⎣
rz + fz + az − cz
rz + fz − cz
rz + az
rz
⎤⎥⎥⎦. (12)
Then the expected payoff of ez choosing cooperation, denoted
as EC
z , can be expressed as the weighted sum of S
1
z and S
2
z
corresponding to the strategies of ez and the opponent being
CC, and CD, where the probabilities of the two cases are θ
and 1− θ, respectively. Thus, we have
EC
z = θS
1
z + (1− θ)S2z .
While if ez chooses defection, ez and any opponent can
produce strategy combinations of DC and DD. Then we can
calculate the expected payoff of ez choosing defection, denoted
as ED
z , based on S
3
z and S
4
z as follows,
ED
z = θS3z + (1− θ)S4z .
As a random player, ez also adopts C and D with the
probabilities θ and 1 − θ, respectively, leading to its average
expected payoff being expressed as
Êz = θE
C
z + (1− θ)ED
z .
According to Malthusian replication dynamic equation [20],
the growth rate of θ, denoted as F (θ), can be expressed by:
F (θ) = θ(EC
z − Êz) = θ(1− θ)(fz − cz), (13)
which is based on the fact that the higher the payoff brought
by the strategy C for any player, the higher the growth rate of
the percentage of channels adopting it.
Given F (θ∗) = 0, we name that θ∗ is the evolutionary stable
solution of the replication dynamic equation if F ′(θ∗) < 0. It
means that even any accidental changes in the strategies of
some players make θ deviate from θ∗, the replication dynamic
can restore θ to θ∗. In mathematics, this is equivalent to that
when θ < θ∗, the dynamic equation leads to F (θ) > 0 in
order to guarantee θ’s increasing trend. On the contrary, if
θ > θ∗, then F (θ) < 0 has to hold to make θ decline. So the
derivative of F (θ) must be less than zero in the steady state
θ∗. Therefore, we calculate the equilibrium points by setting
F (θ) = 0, which has two feasible solutions, i.e., θ1 = 0, and
θ2 = 1. And we can calculate the derivative of F (θ) as
F ′(θ) = (1− 2θ)(fz − cz). (14)
Theorem V.1. If cz < fz , θ = 1 is an evolutionarily stable
point of the evolutionary PCN game.
Proof. When cz < fz , there exists F (θ) > 0 for any θ ∈ (0, 1)
according to (13), which indicates that θ increases over time
until θ = 1. By substituting θ = 1 into (13) and (14), we
have F (1) = 0 and F ′(1) < 0. Therefore, θ = 1 is the
evolutionarily stable point in this case. If some channels’
strategies accidentally change to D leading to θ < 1, the
growth rate F (θ) > 0 makes θ increase toward 1.
Theorem V.2. If cz > fz , θ = 0 is an evolutionarily stable
point of the evolutionary PCN game.
Proof. In the case of cz > fz , F (θ) < 0 holds for θ ∈ (0, 1)
referring to (13), θ is decreasing over time as long as there
are channels choosing C in the PCN. When θ = 0, we can
calculate F (0) = 0 and F ′(0) = fz − cz < 0 from (13) and
(14). So θ = 0 is the evolutionarily stable point when cz > fz .
If there are few mutations of channels’ strategies resulting in
θ > 0, these channels will update their strategies to bring θ
back to 0 gradually owing to the growth rate F (θ) < 0.
Theorem V.3. If cz = fz , the current system is in a stable
state.
Proof. When cz = fz , F (θ) = 0 is always true, which means
that the change rate of θ is 0, so each channel in the PCN does
not change its strategy, and the initial state remains stable.
B. Evolutionary stability of the ZD strategy
In this section, we explore the evolutionarily stable strategy
(ESS) of the evolutionary PCN game with the involvement of
the ZD strategy. For a strategy T to be an ESS, it has to satisfy
the following definition [21]:
Definition V.1 (Evolutionarily stable strategy). T is an ESS, if
for an arbitrary strategy J �= T , there exists either E(T, T ) >
303
Authorized licensed use limited to: CITY UNIV OF HONG KONG. Downloaded on April 15,2023 at 07:57:22 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. 
E(J, T ), or E(T, T ) = E(J, T ) and E(T, J) > E(J, J),
where the profit function E(T, J) is the payoff of the player
with strategy T when playing against the other one taking
strategy J .
In the evolutionary PCN game involving the ZD strategy, we
can assume that there are two types of strategies for channels,
i.e., ZD strategy and other well-known strategies (denoted as
OT). We define the channel choosing the ZD strategy as eZD,
and its mixed strategy is denoted as p̃ = (p̃1, p̃2, p̃3, p̃4).
Similarly, a channel adopting OT is expressed as eOT , and its
strategy is denoted by q̃ = (q̃1, q̃2, q̃3, q̃4), including the uncon-
ditional defection (ALLD), unconditional cooperation (ALLC),
and win-stay-lose-shift (WSLS) strategies as examples. When
eOT chooses the ALLD strategy, q̃ = (0, 0, 0, 0); when eOT
chooses the ALLC strategy, q̃ = (1, 1, 1, 1); while if eOT
chooses the WSLS strategy, q̃ = (1, 0, 0, 1).
Next, under the several strategies introduced above, when
ZD players choose to control the opponent’s or their own
payoffs, respectively, we can analyze its ESS feature in the
evolutionary PCN game.
1) When eZD tries to set the payoff of the opponent: The
payoffs of channels playing against the eZD is determined by
p̃1 and p̃4 as shown in (9). When eZD plays the game with
eOT , we have eOT ’s payoff
E(OT,ZD) =
(1− p̃1)rOT + p̃4(rOT + fOT + aOT − cOT )
(1− p̃1) + p̃4 ,
and eZD’s payoff as
E(ZD,OT ) =
D(p̃, q̃,SZD)
D(p̃, q̃,1)
,
which is dependent on both players’ strategies, and can be
calculated using (4). Since the above equation can be over-
length, we do not fully expand the expression here. We know
that eZD enforces the payoff regardless of the opponent’s
strategy, which implies that it also enforces this on another
ZD player. Therefore, when the opponent takes ZD strategy,
we have E(ZD,ZD) = E(OT,ZD). When eOT plays the
game with another eOT , the payoff of eOT changes according
to what the specific OT strategy they adopt. In detail, when
OT is the ALLD strategy, E(OT,OT ) = rOT . When OT
is the ALLC strategy or the WSLS strategy, E(OT,OT ) =
rOT + fOT + aOT − cOT . Here we have the payoff vectors
SZD,SOT for eZD and eOT , which represent their respective
payoffs under different combinations of strategies.
In the above cases, we compare the relationship between the
different payoffs to determine which strategy is the ESS.
Theorem V.4. If E(ZD,OT ) > E(OT,OT ), the ZD strategy
is the ESS. If E(ZD,OT ) < E(OT,OT ), the opposing
strategy is the ESS.
Proof. When eZD chooses to set the opponent’s payoff, both
eOT and eZD who play with eZD have the payoff controlled
by eZD, so the payoffs E(ZD,ZD) and E(OT,ZD) are
equivalent. We determine the existence of ESS by using
the second condition in Definition V.1. In our case, only
when E(ZD,OT ) > E(OT,OT ), ZD is the ESS and vice
versa.
2) When eZD tries to set its own payoff: We denote eZD’s
payoff from (11) as
E(ZD,OT ) =
(1− p̃1)rZD + p̃4(rZD + fZD + aZD − cZD)
(1− p̃1) + p̃4 ,
while E(ZD,ZD) = E(ZD,OT ). And the payoff of eOT
playing against the eZD is denoted as
E(OT,ZD) =
D(p̃, q̃,SOT )
D(p̃, q̃,1)
.
The payoff of eOT against another eOT is E(OT,OT ), whose
value is decided by the specific OT strategy adopted. Similarly,
the determination of the ESS depends on the four payoffs of
both sides in the game.
Theorem V.5. If E(ZD,OT ) > E(OT,ZD), or E(ZD,OT )
= E(OT,ZD) and E(ZD,OT ) > E(OT,OT ), the ZD strat-
egy is the ESS. If E(OT,OT ) > E(ZD,OT ), or E(OT,OT )
= E(ZD,OT ) and E(OT,ZD) > E(ZD,ZD), the opposing
strategy is the ESS.
The procedure of the proof is similar to that of Theorem
V.4, so we omit it for brevity.
C. Experimental evaluation
We validate the results of replication dynamic analysis by
simulating the process of the evolutionary PCN game. We
simulate 1000 channels to represent the PCN with random
connections between channels. Furthermore, we set rz , fz , and
az as 2, 1.5, and 1.2, respectively, while cz as 0.5, 2.5, 1.5 to
satisfy the relationship between cz and fz in three different
cases. We assume that the initial proportion of C players in
the whole PCN population is 0.4 and channels play a random
pairing game with its neighbors. After each round of game,
each channel randomly selects an opponent, if the opponent’s
payoff is higher than its own, it learns the opponent’s strategy.
We verify our analysis by observing the evolution of the
popular strategy in 100 consecutive rounds of game. According
to Fig. 7, when cx < fx, the channels tend to take the strategy
C, and accordingly, θ = 1 is the evolutionarily stable point.
In the case of cx > fx, channels tend to take the strategy D
finally, so θ = 0 is an evolutionarily stable point. In addition,
when cx = fx, channels remain stable without changing their
strategies.
In Fig. 8, we study whether the ZD strategy is an ESS
in the evolutionary PCN game. We assume that when a ZD
player, i.e., eZD, sets the payoff of opponent, eZD makes the
payoff as small as possible; when eZD sets its own payoff,
eZD makes the payoff as large as possible. Similarly, we
set the initial percentage of the ZD players to 0.4. Fig. 8(a)
shows the change in the number of ZD players playing against
three other strategies when setting the payoff range of eOT ,
where we set rOT , fOT , aOT , cOT as 2, 1.5, 1.2, 1.8 and
p̃1 = 0.99, p̃4 = 0.01. Fig. 8(b) shows the convergence of the
ZD players when eZD controls its own payoff, where we set

When eZD controls the opponent’s payoff, if OT is ALLD,
E(ZD,OT ) < E(OT,OT ) is satisfied, then ZD players will
gradually disappear; while if eOT takes the ALLC or WSLS
strategy, E(ZD,OT ) > E(OT,OT ) holds, channels tend to
learn the ZD strategy, which means that the ZD strategy is an
ESS. This is consistent with Theorem V.4. When eZD sets its
own optimal payoff, if OT is ALLC, eZD will learn from eOT
gradually because E(OT,OT ) > E(ZD,OT ); while if OT
is ALLD or WSLS, E(ZD,OT ) > E(OT,ZD) holds, then
ZD strategy will spread to the whole population, becoming an
ESS in this case, which verifies Theorem V.5.

VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose a game model for the PCN
as well as conduct progressive and complementary analyses
based on this model to study the behavior characteristics of
channels under the scenario with malicious attacks. Based
on the classic game theory with the complete rationality
assumption, we study the two-player game from a microcosmic
perspective, which reveals the impacts of parameters and
strategy choices on the individual characteristics. Furthermore,
taking advantage of the evolutionary game theory with the
limited rationality of players, we study the group behavior
from a macroscopic perspective, which serves as a foundation
for portraying the evolution of the PCN. Through analyzing
the behavioral characteristics of channel interactions from
individuals to the whole population of PCN, we can provide
guidance for individuals’ optimization and eliciting mutual
cooperation in the PCN. Extensive simulation experiments
verify the effectiveness of our analysis.
