Abstract. The distributed architecture of applications such as blockchains,
wireless sensor networks, multi-agent platforms, and the Internet of Things
charges technological development to face, by default, with two aspects of
responsibility that were usually accorded to human beings: the “decision” (Who
is enabled to make decisions in a decentralized system? What about the
mechanism for deciding? Authorized by whom? With what kind of consensus?)
and “ethics” (To which principles must respond the decision-making mecha-
nism? And, if decisions are distributed, what is the role of ethics? To guide or to
laissez-faire? Permissive or restrictive? For everyone or only for those who are
authorized?). Responding to these epochal questions can lead to rethinking the
distributed technologies in view of a game-changing transformation of models
of trust-in-governance. From a model signed by centralization of trust, we have
come to progressively more decentralized forms until the contemporary “dis-
tributed trust”. This paper constitutes an endeavor to introduce and address the
main philosophical foundations of this historical passage.

1 Ethics and Decision in Distributed Technology
1.1 Philosophy as Pilot of Technology? the Moralizing of Things
and the Informatization of Morality
The title may seem a provocation: How can technology be guided by philosophy, being
they are two forms of rationality so distant? Philosophy means meditation, contem-
plation; technology instead is pragmatic, speed, anticipation, and consumption. How
can philosophy guide the technological development? The answer starts with observing
technological development.
For centuries the technique has been understood as the human instrument par
excellence to forge nature and replicate its strength and capacity for regeneration.
Think to the myth of Prometheus and fire. Today, technologies appear to shape a
societal power far beyond the nature and instrumentality [1]. The so-called “4th

Revolution” [2] has transformed ICTs in environmental forces that create and transform
our realities. Data technologies are changing the links between sociality and privacy: in
the past they were contrasting concepts and one represented the groundless intrusion in
the other’s domain [3], today they are slowly adjoining and aligned [4], so much that
someone hypothesizes the birth of a “group privacy” [5].
In the past, many philosophers and thinkers have been concerned for many decades
to understand the nature of this power and stable norms and methods to regulate it:
John Dewey, Martin Heidegger, Herbert Marcuse, Günther Anders, just to name a few.
It can be assumed that the main anxiety that worries those thinkers is that, if one day
technology will hold a teleological power – the capacity to establish its own ends for
itself – this would not only be a danger for limiting the human responsibility, but it
would undermine the entire foundations of human rationality.
The inquiry with these accounts about the dangerousness of technology lies in a
split vision of being human and technology struggling over the world. Humans and
technologies are figured as superpowers that play the hegemony over a world made up
of dumb and unarmed things. The novelty is that the technological development pushes
the world toward a disruptive scenario where things can communicate. The number of
smart objects is keeping growing. Different studies forewarn that by the 2020th around
34 billion smart devices will be connected to the Internet (24 billion IoT objects and 10
billion more traditional devices such as smartphones, tablets, smartwatch, etc.) [6].
A world in which even things contribute, with their M2M communications, to shift
meanings and make decisions, it is a world no longer human-centered in a philo-
sophical sense. This implies a set of imperative queries: What is the moral consistence
of a M2M communication? When is it really true? In more exhaustive words: To which
logical and ethical criteria this communication must respond? Do human being have
already embedded by history or experience the conditions of thinkability of these
criteria or, otherwise, do we have to learn novel way of thinking the truth?
It therefore seems evident to envisage that digital technologies and ICTs will place
philosophy once again at the center of knowledge. This is the background thesis of
paper, a legacy of philosophy with a supplementary role. No longer investigating
separately the construction of human subjectivity and the being of the world, rather
quite the opposite, intersectively: the construction of the world though the being of
agents operating such a construction. There are trends observable in society that seem
to authorize this thesis:
• The moralizing of things. Objects are increasingly designed for having already
incorporated value-laden settings [7, 8].
• The informatization of reality. ICT have populated not only the devices of tech-
nology but also the language and its “metaphors we live by” [9], that is the key
vehicle to construct the meaning of the world and collect a shared social imaginary.
Our experiences are formed in a reality that is conditioned by computer technology
in a consistent manner [10]. This substrate filters through the cognitive and emo-
tional processes also in the ways in which we elaborate visions of the world,
especially in all those types of technologies that are based on the relationship in
order to be performative (machine learning, AI, blockchain, IoT, total no-gate
solution).

1.2 Distributed Technologies: Strengths and Weaknesses
of an Announced Technological Revolution
According to many experts, the blockchain and more generally distribute technologies
[DTs] represent the most suitable candidate technologies capable of maintaining an
immutable log of transactions happening in a distributed network, building a truly
decentralized, trustless and secure environment for the IoT [11], representing the
infrastructure of reference for the operation of this “spiderweb of intelligent objects”
[12]. The most known DTs are represented by the blockchain, namely, a digital ledger
that allows for verification without having to be dependent on third-parties. When the
blockchain first term appeared, in an article of 1991, it referred an abstract description
of “a cryptographically secured chain of blocks” [12]. However, Nakamoto, an
anonymous person (or group of persons) is universally recognized being father of the
blockchain formally theorizing the blockchain technology [13] and implementing it (in
2008 and 2009, respectively) as a core component of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. From
this starting point, the theoretically-disruptive impact of DTs has been addressed as
response that offers benefits in several other domains of application. But, along with the
benefits, the worries have also grown. In the Table 1 we resume the most evident
potentiality as well as weaknesses of DTs.
1.3 “Distributed”, the Quality Beyond the Border of Technology: The
Case of PERSONA Project
Despite the many qualities and faults, DTs cannot be totally considered as hoaxes or,
opposedly, as revolutionary not only because they are too new technologies to be
assessed. Rather, the crux of the matter concerns the ontological transformation – if we
may say so – DTs concurs to promote of the “border of technology”. Thinking of
technology as a rationality that designs smart and intelligent “agent” (robots,

autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligences) means failing to see an important facet. So
that these devices can work best, technology must be rethink beyond the border that
previously separated the agents from their environment. This distinction has been
reconceptualized and we have tom assume it in form of a flow that relates agent and
environment within enabling architectures. Against this backdrop, “distributed tech-
nology” is no longer a defined type of technology – such as blockchain or distributed
ledger technology – rather it becomes an interpretative paradigm of technological
development. “Distributed” is the environmental characteristic that will characterize
future integration between moral agents, technological architectures, and security
systems to overcome the current practices of “border”. From this point of view, an
interesting case study is represented by the EU project PERSONA of which the authors
of this paper are partners [22].
The project does not deal with DTs commonly understood. Its main aim is to design
and establish effective methods in order to carry out an impact assessment of no-gate
border-controlling technology. Nevertheless, the distributed nature of the no-gate
technologies, theoretically, favors the integration and facilitation both of crossing the
border (i.e., no-gate solution), and controlling people (i.e., intensive use of technology
to handle personal data and risk of data manipulation). Precisely this new possibility of
combination makes important the role of decision-making and ethics in guide dis-
tributed technology.
1.4 The Importance of Ethics and Decision-Making to Guide
the Environmental Architecture of Technology
For many years we have become accustomed with physically technological artefacts
that constituted a “presence” in the world. They needed to be crossed, to be installed,
and “power supplied” by switching or physical operations. In this sense, DTs aims to
be no-gate, flowing, environmentally installed, and monitored by other technology and
as much as possible designed for self-supply. Philosophically speaking, it seems a
move from presence to absence. Against this backdrop, such a configuration needs also
to be accompanied in its progressive development according to two guidelines:
• Decision-making. The rules of the decision represent the main technical and reg-
ulatory aspect for the good functioning of the system and its elements. Therefore,
both decision-making rules relating to the experience of the agents (transparency,
security, privacy, immutability) and decision-making rules relating to the mainte-
nance of the distributed nature of the environment (adaptability, resilience, level of
consensus, trust) are important. Agents well educated to the distribution but living
in an environment without rules and not very protected, end up succumbing to
external attacks. On the contrary, a too top-down and vertically managed envi-
ronment that protects itself from everyone, including its elements, loses the essential
quality of distribution in the long run.
• Ethics. For guaranteeing the accurate balance between the instances of agents and
those of environment, the decision-making process needs to be guided by rules that
respond to ethical principles. Ethics gives the rules the value-laden contents that
allow rules not only to be observed as “commands”, but to be chosen as an intrinsic
Ethics and Decisions in Distributed Technologies 303
and rational aspect of a more universal vision [23] or, in the case of an artificial
intelligence, as an agent performing different levels of abstraction [2].
2 Distributed Technologies, Trust, and Governance
of Democracy
2.1 Trust, a Complex Human Feeling
It is commonly believed that trust has to do with having moral certainty and security,
but it also includes the idea of risk [24].
Trust therefore moves between two opposing poles, on the one hand security, on
the other vulnerability. It plays an important role both at interpersonal and impersonal
level. But as the classical theorists of sociological thought – among others Georg
Simmel and Émile Durkheim – trust is a pre-contractual element of social life, that is,
with those basic solidarity and implicit cooperative agreement (both moral and cog-
nitive) that allow to ‘hold together’ the society. In impersonal systems such as eco-
nomics or law, trust develops a general social bound that leads to the internalization of
common values, that is an active adherence to the normative order [25], or to a blind
mechanism of adhesion to society released from the motivational structures of the
actors [24]. Finally, at the political level, trust is the moral basis of the consensus that
allow the legitimacy of the institutions [26].
2.2 Are We Experiencing a Real “Crisis of Trust”?
Today, many facts of the reality speak about a “crisis of trust”. Rachel Botsman in a
recent book [27], analyzing the 2017 report of Barometer of trust, underlines how the
trust regarding the intermediate bodies of society is the lowest of recent decades. The
most interesting aspect is that the people interviewed said they had lost confidence not
only in governments and private companies – a consideration perfectly explainable in
the view of the ongoing economic and political crisis – but also for media and NGOs,
thus those agencies of society that should act as a critical marker of democratic values
such truth, cooperation, solidarity, etc. By the 82% of the contexts surveyed, media are
considered part of the elite. This misrepresentation has caused an implosion of trust in
participatory processes and generated a parallel tendency to prefer self-referential truths
and rely on own peers. It seems that people try to confirm the beliefs already they have,
often turning to people they already know. Today trust and influence are directed more
towards “people” – family members, friends, classmates, colleagues – than towards
hierarchical elites, experts and authorities.
However, social behaviors that seem to disconfirm this negative picture are
observable in society. An interesting study is the Science Barometer, a representative
survey of German citizens on science and research: The 2018 report shows that, despite
the mentioned hostility towards elites, the public trust in science and research remains
stable. But above all, the phenomenon of greater empirical relevance is the fortune of
global companies that operate in the online marketplace. In a society apparently closes
to the hierarchical elites, where individuals’ preferences count more than abstract
304 A. Carnevale and C. Occhipinti
institutions, it happens inexplicably that millions of people share billions of sensible
personal data on remote and de-materialized platforms, sharing imagines, memories,
emotions with virtual (often unknown) contacts on social forums.
Is there an effective crisis of trust?
2.3 The Crisis as Change of Trust-in-Governance Model
It is evident that trust, even today, remain the same complex feeling between risk and
inclination, egoism and reliance. The novelty is rather represented by the fact that we
are faced with a profound transformation of the models that link trust and governance.
From an era of centralization of trust, we have come to progressively more decen-
tralized forms until today where an era of distributed trust.
The main advantage of the distributed trust model is that it brings the community of
experts closer to the community of stakeholders, the flaw is that it remains a model of
engineering computing [28].
2.4 Democracy for Trusting Distributed Technology
Nevertheless, these models outlook how trust has changed, but they do not explain why
trust changes in this determined way, nor do they offer counteractive tools to intervene in
case the human development should not be directed as desiderata. Although these
models fit into an appreciable and shareable interpretive line – i.e. the environmental
character of DTs favors transparent and secure processes of decision making and the-
oretical respect of fundamental ethical principles – however, they alone are not enough
to guarantee democracy. Extra distributed decisions and deeper ethical load are not a
sign of better democracy. From the point of view of distribution, as economist Amartya
Sen has argued, a more transparent and equal distribution has little meaning if we do not
understand the weight that the distributed good has in the capacity of individuals to
realize their life plans [29]. On the other hand, if we mean ethics as respect for fun-
damental human values, it is not enough to make those values a real practice. There is no
proportional automatism between more distributed technology and better ethical quality
of life. Such automatism is but a possible version of how the two can be governed
together. Therefore, the definition of decisions and ethical values are necessary aspects
so that trust can be a constituent of DTs architectures, but they are not sufficient con-
ditions. Sufficiency is reached when decisions and ethical values are “problematized”
rather than “defined”. Problematic in the sense of being subjected to the democratic
scrutiny of the public discussion. Problematization is the better distributed form of
governance of democracy. It does not mean inventing difficulties where there are not,
but rather enhancing democracy as an epistemic [30] and communicative [31] space to
offer and to take reasons. Democracy is a problematization of facts in view of better
collectively participated solutions. In so doing, DTs will help people to regain the trust
in institutions, that is providing political decentralizations that give citizens or their
elected representatives more power in public decision-making [32].
Ethics and Decisions in Distributed Technologies 305
3 Conclusions
No-gate border-controlling technology, IoT, blockchain, multi-agent platform, and any
other DTs can increase the perception of reality, but this does not in itself imply an
increase in democratic quality of the empirical experience. The positive philosophical
aspects of the DTs – emphasizing decision-making and ethical principles at the center
of the policy agenda – are just the initial step (and not the solution) of the slow
integration of the digital revolution with the human development and the environmental
eco-sustainability. The return of philosophy as insightful disciplines in constructing the
world does not simplify things, nor complicates them, simply questions them in the
positive sense, that is, makes them more democratic. In this sense, DTs and democracy
will converge if the former will provide the latter an informational and socialized space
to trust the democratization of the decision-making mechanism. We need more dis-
tributed technological media to enhance the dialectical game of democracy: giving and
requesting public reasons to discuss socially-relevant facts, to involve citizens in public
consultations, to deliberate solutions that solve the actual problems but, at the same
time, create responsibility and accountability for the future sustainability.
