Abstract— A tourism serious game requires a transaction 
system to handle the transaction process's visualization between 
players. In this paper, we propose a serious game with a 
blockchain-based multiplayer transaction system. To integrate 
the transaction system with the game engine, we use the 
ethereum platform. In this serious game, ethereum handles the 
simulation of transaction activities between several characters' 
choices, including tourists, ticket sellers, jeep drivers, traders, 
and horse rental. The experimental results show that the gas 
price variable affects the speed of the transaction process. 
Meanwhile, setting the gas limit value in this serious game 
affects the transaction process's success rate between players.  
Keywords—tourism, serious game, multiplayer, transaction 
system,  blockchain 
I. INTRODUCTION  
There are three phases in traveling activities: before the 
trip, during the trip, and after the trip [1]. Between the three 
stages, before the trip becomes an essential phase, a tourist 
prepares and plans the tourism activities they will do in this 
phase. In the before trip phase, tourists explore data and 
information before determining the choice of tourism 
destinations. Today's development makes it easy for tourists 
to explore tourist destinations from the internet through 
websites and social media [2]. However, tourists' not all 
required information is well visualized, especially concerning 
interactions and transactions between parties at tourist 
attractions, such as tourists and ticket providers, tour guides, 
or other parties at tourist attractions. This visualization is 
important because tourists need an understanding of the 
activities to be carried out at tourist attractions as a 
consideration for determining destination choices. To answer 
this problem, it is necessary to develop alternative media with 
visualization that makes tourists interested and easier to 
absorb the information illustrated. 
Several studies have developed various forms of media as 
information providers for tourists, among others, the web [3], 
mobile application [4], augmented reality [5], and game [6]. 
Among these media, games are an interesting one to be 
developed as a medium of learning, simulation, and 
information visualization. The serious game is one of the 
game genres appropriate to be used as a medium of learning 
and visualization. It has elements of teaching, learning, 
training, adaptation to the environment, and entertainment. [7] 
[8]. Therefore, this study uses a serious game to simulate and 
visualize transactions between tourists so that users as 
potential tourists are interested and easily understand the 
transaction activities.  
We propose an architecture using blockchain technology 
to support a transaction system's development in a serious 
game. In some research, blockchain has been used 
successfully in the cryptocurrency transaction system on 
Bitcoin [9], tourism rating data sharing [10], medical data 
sharing [11], and also autonomous transaction for IoT-based 
e-commerce [12]. Blockchain is a technology platform that 
uses a decentralized network architecture [13]. This 
architecture has advantages over other architectures, namely 
centralized. Using a decentralized architecture, each node in 
the network has characteristics connected, so that data 
transmission between nodes does not need to go through the 
middle node. [14]. Apart from having a decentralized 
architecture, blockchain also has distributed data sharing 
characteristics and has better security [15]. This research takes 
advantage of blockchain's benefits to improve the transaction 
system's performance in the serious game of tourism. 
To integrate blockchain technology, we use Etherium as a 
platform that supports game design through the Unity 3D 
game engine. The platform has a Smart Contract feature that 
allows transaction scenarios to set the game's economic value 
[16]. We built a serious game with Bromo Mountain tourism's 
theme to implement the proposed blockchain-based 
multiplayer transaction system architecture. This game has 
several characters that can be used by each user to simulate 
transactions between them. Furthermore, this study's trial 
phase has a role in determining and analyzing the speed of the 
process and the success of transactions between users based 
on several variables on the ethereum platform.  
We divide this paper into several sections to explain the 
steps for designing a serious game and the trials' analysis 
results. These sections include Introduction, Related Work, 
Design and Method, Result and Discussion, and finally, 
Conclusion.

II. RELATED WORK  
Several studies discuss the implementation and integration 
of games in the tourism sector. In a paper, Feifei Xu shows his 
research results that identify tourists' motivation to play tourist 
games [17]. In another article, he stated that building a tourism 
serious game was useful for increasing brand awareness and 
loyalty to the destination [18]. This paper describes several 
conceptual examples of the application of games in the 
tourism sector. Paper [19] proposed gamification techniques 
on three phases of the trip to support the tourism destination's 
visiting process. Gamification in the before trip stage has a 
function to increase the interest of tourists to visit. One way is 
to design game content that contains visualizations of internal 
activities at tourist attractions. Paper [20] proposed a tourism 
game architecture with a multiplayer concept. This research 
still discusses communication between players to find virtual 
and real objects in the game and has not yet addressed the 
transaction system's visualization.  
Paper [21] discusses the concept of transactions in the 
massively multiplayer online games genre. The author of the 
paper proposes a transaction concept to determine the 
consistency model in the game environment. Jouni Smed 
presents four aspects that affect multiplayer computer games, 
including the communication architecture and control 
architecture used, for example, centralized, decentralized, 
distributed, and replicated. At his point, Leo Besancon 
proposes blockchain as a decentralized and distributed 
architecture to handle data exchange transactions in video 
games. He also presented the original data representation of 
game assets using blockchain to improve the data exchange 
process [22]. Paper [23] introduced a multiplayer online game 
using blockchain as realtime cheat prevention to increase 
security in the game.  
III. DESIGN AND METHOD 
In this study, we built a transaction system between 
players for a blockchain-based tourism serious game. Figure 
1 shows a proposed system architecture consisting of several 
parts: player, player device, game visualization, ethereum 
blockchain transaction system, ethereum blockchain network, 
and other player devices. 
 
Figure 1: Proposed system architecture 
In this study, prospective tourists play games using their 
own devices, such as smartphones, iPads, or computers. In the 
user's device, we designed the game visualization using the 
Unity3D game engine. To build 3D assets, we use Blender3D 
software. To construct an ethereum blockchain-based 
transaction system, we use Visual Studio as the Script Editor 
and Metamask as the blockchain wallet dashboard. The 
software is open-source with an easy to understand user 
interface. This research uses the ethereum blockchain network 
to connect each player device to interact with each other. 
Furthermore, this paper describes the research steps in two 
stages. First, designing and building visualization and scenario 
of the Mount Bromo tourism game, and the second is building 
an ethereum blockchain-based transaction system. The details 
of the two stages are as follows. 
A. Mount Bromo Tourism Game  
Mount Bromo tourism game is a serious game genre that 
simulates transaction activities between parties in Mount 
Bromo tourist attractions. When playing this game, players 
must follow the game flow, as shown in Figure 2. In the early 
stages of the game, the player as the host faces the start menu, 
which can be accessed after acquiring clients in their room. 
Three menus can be selected on the main menu, starting to 
enter the gameplay location selection, finding out information 
about the Mount Bromo tourist park, and exiting to exit the 
game.  
 
Figure 2: Mount Bromo tourism game flow 
 After the main menu display, the game's scenario rules 
start from choosing the character player want to play, where 
each character has a different role. These characters' choices 
include tourists, jeep drivers, shop traders, ticket sellers, and 
horse rental services. After character selection, players will 
immediately enter the game and carry out tasks according to 
their respective roles. The tasks of each character are as 
follows. 
• Tourists explore all locations in the tourist park of 
Mount Bromo. 
• Jeep driver driving a jeep rented by tourists. 
• Traders are selling goods to tourists. 
• Ticket seller sells tickets to tourists who will enter 
tourist attractions. 
• Horse rental services provide horse riding services 
for tourists. 
If the players complete the mission, they will get reward 
points. Then they can choose to play again or finish playing.

B. Blockchain Transaction 
To implement blockchain technology in game design, we 
use the Ethereum framework. This framework handles the 
transaction system between players in the Unity 3D game 
engine. By using blockchain as a decentralized method, 
allowing players and developers to control transactions 
jointly. So that players can fully own and manage their items 
and assets. Players can sell their assets to get the currency 
they can use both inside and outside the game. Item 
ownership cannot be changed or deleted even by the 
developer because the decentralized system is complicated to 
penetrate. Therefore, using this decentralized system is 
expected to increase credibility and security in playing this 
game. Figure 3 shows an illustration of the transaction flow 
in this proposed game. 
 
 
Figure 3: Transaction flow  
When the player performs the transaction process in the 
game, some data is ready to be sent. The data includes the 
player's identity, type of transaction, and the number of 
tokens used. The system uses this data as input to be 
processed by ethereum for verification purposes. After the 
data is verified, the photon network then processes it to 
produce a photon output process. Figure 4 illustrates each of 
these processes. 
  
 
Figure 4: Transaction process 
After ethereum gets input data from player transactions, 
there are several processes this framework carries out, 
including creating block structures, hashing, validating 
Proof-of-Work, and publishing to the blockchain network. 
Figure 5 shows the block structure published on the ethereum 
blockchain network, including the block header, block index, 
previous block hash, transaction root hash, receipt root hash, 
timestamp, difficulty, nonce, gas limit, and the gas used. 
 
 
Figure 5: Block structure 
A detailed explanation of the parts of the block structure 
is as follows. 
• Block index hash is the index number of the block 
• Block hash is the hash value of the block  
• The previous block hash is the hash value of the 
previous block 
• Transaction root hash is the hash value that generated 
for each transaction execution 
• Receipt root hash is the hash value of the transaction 
details 
• The timestamp is the time of block creation 
• Difficultly is the level of difficulty to mine.  
• The nonce is an integer value determined by the 
miner to select a valid hash value. 
• The gas limit is the gas variable limit set for the block 
• The gas used is the amount of gas used by all 
transactions 
In an ethereum blockchain-based transaction system, each 
data input will go through several processes, including 
creating blocks, hashing, Proof-of-Work validation to 
broadcast blocks to the blockchain network. Figure 6 shows in 
detail each step in the process. The first process in sending 
input data to ethereum is entering data into blocks, including 
the type of transaction, the value sent, the destination of 
transaction, gas limit, private critical account. After the data 
entry to the block, the system performs the hashing process 
using the Keccak-256 algorithm.  
Keccak-256 is a hashing algorithm used on the Ethereum 
network. This algorithm is similar to the SHA-3 hashing 
standard, but the two algorithms produce different outputs. 
This algorithm also produces an output of 32 bytes with an 
input of an arbitrary length. As with other hashing algorithms, 
this algorithm also has a characteristic where the initial input 
generated cannot be easily calculated even with known output. 
140Authorized licensed use limited to: CITY UNIV OF HONG KONG. Downloaded on April 15,2023 at 07:25:04 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. 
One of the main functions for Keccak-256 in the Ethereum 
framework is to handle the creation of account addresses. The 
address has a hexadecimal value, where each ethereum 
address is 40 hexadecimal digits long [24]. This algorithm is 
used automatically in the hashing process by the ethereum and 
is the framework's default. 
 
Figure 6: Validation using Proof of Work 
The hashing process will check whether the computation 
amount exceeds the previously entered gas limit value in the 
unity3D code line. If the computation value exceeds the 
specified gas limit, the system stops the process. If the 
computation has not exceeded the gas limit value, it continues 
to the Proof of Work process. In the Proof of Work process, 
the system validates the hash value. If the hash value still 
hasn't reached the target, the system will perform a 
pseudorandom increment process and repeat the hashing 
process until the hash value reaches the target. After the target 
is achieved, the Proof-of-Work process continues to validate 
the input data. If the data entered is invalid, then the process 
is stopped, and the program sends a message to the system, in 
the form of error details. Otherwise, the system continues the 
block publication process to the blockchain network. 
After publishing a new block to the network, each block 
forms a block's chain to be connected. Each block is associated 
with a block hash and a previous block hash. For example, the 
previous block hash of block 2 has the same value as the block 
hash of block 1, while the previous block hash value is block 
3, same as the block hash of block 2. The data contained by 
the new block is broadcast throughout the network so that 
every connected node in the network can store the data. 
C. Ethereum Blockchain Setup 
In the ethereum blockchain setup, this study's first process 
is to make a wallet that will accommodate smart contract 
tokens to become the main currency in this tourism serious 
game. A smart contract is one of the advantages of the 
Ethereum framework, where everyone can program the 
transactions they want. In this research, we use smart 
contracts to create an in-game currency used for transactions 
between players and developers. Figure 7 shows the flow of 
smart contract token creation to support the transaction 
system in this study. 
 
 
 
Figure 7: Smart contract creation flow 
IV. RESULT AND DISCUSSION 
This section describes the results of testing the transaction 
system carried out between characters. Some examples of 
transaction activity between characters are as follows.  
• When tourists transact with the ticket seller, tourists 
make payment transactions for Bromo tourism 
entrance tickets. After tourists have completed 
payment transactions, the gate bar for tourist 
attractions opens.  
• When tourists have made payments for jeep driver 
services, the jeep driver takes the tourists to Bromo 
crater's location.  
• When players meet with rental horses, they can 
choose a horse and make transactions for the rental. 
The player interacts with horse rental services to 
simulate a tour by riding a horse. 
 The transaction testing in this study includes testing the 
transaction speed, transaction success, and transaction 
accuracy. Several variables influence testing, including gas 
price, gas limit, gas used, and data size. Gas price is the cost 
incurred for each gas used, and the gas limit is the limit for 
using gas in the transaction process, gas used is the amount of 
gas used in the transaction process, while data size is the 
weight of the data that processed in the transaction. 
A. Transaction Speed 
Several things that affect the speed of transactions include 
the number of blocks in the network, gas price, and data 
weight. The more blocks in the blockchain network, the 
longer the Proof of Work validation process will take. Gas 
price also affects the speed of the hash value prediction 
because the more significant the price offered, the faster the 
transaction process will be. The data weight affects the 
transaction process's speed because the more influential the 
processed data's weight, the longer the processing time is 
needed. It is impossible to change the number of blocks and 
data weights to adjust the transaction speed. These two

variables are variables related to the amount and quality of 
data. So that among the three variables, gas price is the most 
likely to be adjusted to get changes in transaction speed. 
Equation 1 is a reference for calculating the average for 
processing a transaction.  
�� � �
����
	
��

�� is the average time needed to process a transaction. Ti is 
the time it takes i to process a transaction. � represents the 
number of experiments. This experiment uses a variable cost 
of 0.001 Gwei, 0.01 Gwei, 0.1 Gwei, 1 Gwei, 3 Gwei, and 30 
Gwei to see the cost effect on time. The value of 0.001 Gwei 
is the minimum value for this experiment. This value is the 
lower limit of the miner's fee, so if you use a price below that, 
the ethereum system will automatically reject it. Figure 8 
shows a graph of the difference in transaction time to the gas 
price value for ten experiments. Based on calculations through 
equation 1 of the chart, the gas price value of 0.001 gwei has 
an average transaction time of 60.6 seconds, 0.01 gwei has an 
average transaction time of 43.1 seconds, 0.1 gwei has an 
average transaction time of 29.2 seconds, 1 gwei has an 
average. Average transaction time of 9.7 seconds, 3 gwei has 
an average transaction time of 6.3 seconds, and 30 gwei has 
an average transaction time of 3.8 seconds. The graph also 
shows that when the gas price bid increases, it makes the 
mining transaction process faster.

B. Transaction Success 
The second test in this chapter aims to get a better 
transaction success rate for the gas limit value. The serious 
game's transaction fee is controlled by adjusting the gas Limit 
value and will not be out of the estimated development cost. 
Table 1 shows the difference in the success of the transaction 
on the gas limit value. Based on the table, the gas Limit value 
of 60000 is the most optimal because it is the smallest value 
that produces maximum success. Success is an indicator that 
the data transmission can be processed where the gas used 
does not exceed the gas limit. Unsuccess indicates that data 
cannot be processed because the gas used for the transaction 
exceeds the gas limit value.

C. Transaction Accuracy  
Measurement of transaction accuracy at this stage aims to 
determine the accuracy of transaction cost predictions. The 
way to get this accuracy value is to compare the estimated cost 
with a transaction cost. If the transaction cost has a value less 
than or equal to the estimated cost, the transaction is accurate. 
Meanwhile, if the transaction cost value is greater, transaction 
costs will not be accurate. Figure 9 shows the comparison 
between the estimated cost and transaction cost in 30 
experiments. The result is that the experiment occurs six times 
the transaction cost value that exceeds the estimated cost 
value. Based on these data, it means that the accuracy value of 
transaction cost predictions is 80%. 
 
Figure 9: Comparison of transaction cost and estimate cost 
V. CONCLUSIONS 
This paper proposes a serious game with a transaction 
system architecture to increase tourists' knowledge of 
transaction activities between parties in a tourist destination. 
This serious game has several characters, including tourists, 
ticket sellers, jeep drivers, traders, and horse rental. The 
system uses the ethereum framework to handle blockchain 
implementation in unity3D game engines. Based on the test 
results, setting the gas price value affects the speed of a 
transaction process. This effect is that the greater the gas price, 
the faster the transaction processing time. The experiment 
results also show that the gas limit with a value of 60,000 is 
more optimal for use in serious transaction processes for 
tourism. Besides, the prediction of transaction costs in this 
study has an accuracy of 80%.
