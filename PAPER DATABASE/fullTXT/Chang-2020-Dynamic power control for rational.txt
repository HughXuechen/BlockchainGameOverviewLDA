ABSTRACT
In blockchain and cryptocurrency, miners participate in a proof-
of-work-based distributed consensus protocol to find and generate
a valid block, process transactions, and earn the corresponding
reward. Because cryptocurrency is designed to adapt to the dy-
namic miner network size, a miner’s participation affects the block
difficulty which sets the expected amount of work to find a valid
block. We study the dependency between the mining power con-
trol and the block difficulty and study a rational miner utilizing
such dependency to dynamically control its mining power over a
longer horizon than just the impending block. More specifically,
we introduce I-O Mining strategy where a miner takes advantage
of the block difficulty adjustment rule and toggles between mining
with full power and power off between the difficulty adjustments.
In I-O Mining, the miner influences the block difficulty and mines
only when the difficulty is low, gaming and violating the design in-
tegrity of the mining protocol for its profit gain. We analyze the I-O
Mining’s incentive/profit gain over the static-mining strategies and
its negative impact on the rest of the blockchain mining network in
the block/transaction scalability. Our results show that I-O Mining
becomes even more effective and profitable as there are greater
competitions for mining and the reward and the cost difference
becomes smaller, which are the trends in cryptocurrencies.

1 INTRODUCTION
Blockchain constructs a distributed, immutable, and verifiable ledger
and is the driving technology enabling cryptocurrencies to process
financial transactions without relying on a centralized authority
in a permissionless environment, e.g., Bitcoin and Ethereum. Un-
derlying blockchain is the distributed consensus protocol so that
all nodes agree on the transactions on the ledger without relying

on a trusted third party. The most popular consensus protocol is
based on proof of work (PoW). The miners participate in the PoW
consensus protocol to process the transactions and are financially
incentivized to do so by the block rewards, which are winnings
from solving the probabilistic PoW computational puzzles and find-
ing valid blocks. Since the block reward includes new currencies,
the consensus participants generate new currencies via PoW and
the consensus protocol participation is therefore calledmining, sim-
ilarly to that for extracting valuable minerals such as gold. The
distributed consensus protocol is designed to be fair with respect to
the miner’s computational power, i.e., the greater the computational
power the more likely the miner will find a valid PoW/block and
earn the corresponding reward.
Because cryptocurrencies operate in a permissionless environ-
ment without pre-established trust or identity control, any node
can join as a miner as long as it is capable of computing the hash-
based PoW puzzle and is connected to the network. To adapt to
the varying size and the power capabilities of the mining network
(e.g., the miners dynamically joining and leaving the network), the
consensus protocol adopts an automatic difficulty control which
adapts the block difficulty level according to the overall network’s
mining power. If the miner network power (the aggregate hash
rate) increases, the block difficulty increases accordingly so that
the overall block generation rate is fixed in expectation (e.g., once
every 10 minutes for Bitcoin).
The inter-dependency between the mining power and the con-
sensus/block difficulty yields an opportunity for a sophisticated
and rational miner to more intelligently control its mining power
than simply choosing to either continue or discontinue its min-
ing. The rational miner can control the mining power to influence
the block difficulty. We introduce a dynamic strategy called I-O
Mining (where the name of I-O comes from the power symbol on
the power switch) providing an energy-efficient mining to mine
only when the difficulty level is low. We analyze I-O Mining in
the power-constrained regime (it is also incentive-compatible if
the constraint is on energy as opposed to power, as discussed in
Section 3) and analyze its incentive compatibility over the static
strategies of mining with full power and mining with no power
(the latter corresponding to no mining).
Contributions. We make the following four contributions in
this paper. First, we model the dependency between mining power
and consensus difficulty to analyze the miner’s dynamic power
control. Second, we introduce I-O Mining, a dynamic rational miner
strategy. Third, we analyze the incentive of I-O Mining for energy-
constrained miner (always greater reward gain than static mining)
and for power-constrained miner. For the power-constrained miner,
I-O mining i) yields greater reward gain than the static full-power
mining in some regions and ii) is profitable with positive net profit
even in some other regions where the electricity cost would have
exceeded the block reward if the static full-power mining strategy

had been used, both of which regions occur in the lifetime of any
miner. Fourth, we analyze the negative impact of I-O Mining in the
blockchain scalability.
2 SYSTEM MODEL & BACKGROUND
2.1 Rational and Uncooperative Miner
We consider a miner which is rational (driven by its self interest
in reward profit) and uncooperative (willing and capable to diverge
from the agreed consensus protocol to game the protocol). In other
words, the rational miner choose the mining strategy which is the
most aligned to its incentive, i.e., the chosen strategy yields greater
reward incentives than the other strategies. This is a relevantmining
model because it captures and supports the typical miners driven
by self interests and reward profits. In our model, therefore, an
alternative mining strategy to the honest protocol compliance (such
as our proposed I-O Mining) will only be utilized when it provides
greater incentives and reward than honest mining. If the mining
yields unfair advantage to the miner, then it negatively undermines
the rewards of the other honestly behaving and protocol-compliant
miners. Because of the negative impact on the others, such mining
strategy also aligns with themalicious threat model (focusing on the
destructive impact on other miners rather than the subject miner’s
self interest) including those used in related work in Section 6.
Honest mining corresponds to following the protocol and more
specifically consistently mining, as opposed to selectively mining
for gaming the mining process, in our case. This honest mining
strategy serves as the backup mining strategy for the rational miner
and will be chosen if the alternative mining strategy is not as prof-
itable as honest mining. Honest mining corresponds to the optimal
mining strategy in a one-shot static game, i.e., if only considering
the current mining round and not the future rounds, then the miner
will mine in that round with its full power as long as the mining
is profitable in that round (the expected reward for that round is
greater than the expected power cost).
2.2 Cryptocurrency Mining Model
We model the most popular cryptocurrencies for our work, such as
Bitcoin and Ethereum
1
. The distributed consensus protocol is based
on PoW measuring fairness in computational power (i.e., the more
the power and the greater the hash rate the larger the probability
of winning the block and the larger the expected reward).
PoW is a random process based on finding the input/preimage of
the hash function used for the PoW algorithm, and the miners rely
on brute-force search trying different nonces, which is a part of the
hash function input. Finding a block via brute force is a Poisson
process [12], which makes the block arrival memoryless (e.g., the
probability of finding a block remains constant regardless of how
long the miner has been trying). Blockchain relies on the one-way
property of the hash function and the corresponding randomness
of PoW brute-forcing for security.
We call between the blocks as rounds so that, in each round, the
miners use different block headers which are dependent on the
current block. We also define adjustment periods (or simply periods)
1
Ethereum plans to transition to a hybrid consensus between PoW and proof-of-stake
(PoS) but its research and development, preceding implementation and deployment,
are ongoing [1].
which is the time-length between the block-difficulty adjustment;
this adjustment period is defined by the protocol and fixed in the
number of rounds, e.g., 2016 rounds for Bitcoin. Both rounds and
adjustment periods (discretized in rounds) are random in physical
time, e.g., in seconds, because of the aforementioned randommining
process of finding the block.
The blockchain consensus protocol automatically and adaptively
controls the block difficulty according to the current state in the
mining network’s computational power, e.g., if there are more min-
ers and consequently greater overall hash rate and mining efforts,
then the block difficulty increases. The difficulty control is inversely
proportional to the total miner’s power (measured by the time it
took the miners to find the block as a network). In other words,
the difficulty of the impending period is determined by the time
duration of the previous period.
We also assume that the mining hardware is designed for specific
coins, e.g., the mining-dedicated ASICs are designed for specific
function and algorithm computations, disabling coin hopping (dis-
cussed in Section 6) in many real-world mining implementations.
To put these in to real-world implementation perspectives and
provide an example, in Bitcoin, the period is 2016 rounds and, in
expectation, each round takes 10 minutes and each period takes 2
weeks. Bitcoin is designed to keep these time durations constant
despite the advancing technology and the varying number of par-
ticipating miners. To achieve such design, Bitcoin adjusts the block
difficulty so that the mining threshold increases if the last period
was less than 2 weeks and decreases it if it was longer than 2 weeks,
and the amount of the difficulty adjustment is according to the
difference of the period duration and the targeted 2-week duration.
2.3 System Model Parameters:
α , τ , T , nT , U , R, C, and c
This section builds on Section 2.2 and defines the relevant parame-
ters for our model and analyses. We focus only on the parameters
which are needed for our analyses for simpler presentation, and the
parameters are either controlled by or dependent on the mining
strategy. For example, we normalize our reward-related variables
by the reward amount so that a reward of 1 indicates the full reward
amount (comprised of the block’s new currency and the transaction
fees) regardless of its absolute amount.
The miner has a computational power of α which is normal-
ized with respect to the entire mining network’s power. By the
design of PoW (computationally fair regardless of the number of
accounts/public keys), the attacker’s expected reward is also α , nor-
malized by the block reward amount in that round, if all of the
miners behave honestly. Since the miner has α power, the rest of
the miner network has 1 − α power.
We study the case where the attacker may not utilize its full
power capability. Given its power capability of α , the miner can use
a τ fraction of the power capability, i.e., the miner uses τα power.
Before this research paper and a few prior work [2, 16], it has been
believed that the miner will use all of its power capability to maxi-
mize the reward (which is that of honest mining and τ = 1) as long
as the mining process is profitable (yielding greater block rewards
than the electricity costs). While α is given after installing the hard-
wares and setting up the mining rigs, τ is fully controllable at any
48

given time since it indicates how much of the power capability the
miner will use. We call the mining strategy dynamic if the miner
varies and actively controls τ across rounds/blocks, i.e., a dynamic
miner varies τ across rounds (while a static miner does not) and is
motivated to do so because of the dependency between the previous
round and the current round from the automatic block-difficulty
control by the consensus protocol.
We denote the round duration for round i (the amount of time
for mining block i) as Ti , e.g., T0 = 0 corresponds to the genesis
block and if there has been x blocks mined in the ledger so far, then∑x
i=0Ti determines how long it took for the ledger to grow x-block
long beyond the zeroth genesis block (which block sets up mining
and consensus protocol but does not involve mining). There are n
rounds for a period (one period equals n consecutive rounds) where
n is a positive integer pre-determined and agreed by the protocol,
and the period duration for period j is nT =
∑nj
i=n (j−1)+1Ti and the
targeted period duration by the consensus protocol is
cT . While
nT
is random (because each of the Ti is random),
cT is constant and
pre-determined by the protocol, e.g.,
cT = 2 weeks in Bitcoin (i.e.,
Bitcoin is designed to produce blocks every two weeks on average).
If the miners all behave honestly, E[
nT ] = cT averaged over the
periods of the blockchain ledger/history. (The block difficulty of
that period, also very relevant to our model, does not require an
additional variable because it is simply inversely proportional to
nT
by the automatic difficulty control in the consensus protocol design
as described in Section 2.2. In other words, if block difficulty is
denoted withD, thenD = b
nT where b is a protocol-given constant.)
The miner’s objective is to increase its reward profit rate, which
is equal to the expected block reward per time minus the power cost
consumed for running the PoW mining. We denote this rate utility
function (U ) as the difference between the expected block reward
(R) and the power cost of mining (C), i.e., U = R −C . If the miners
behave honestly, R = α by the design of PoW (computationally fair).
We measureU ,R,C per period (which is n number of rounds) while
α , c are per round, because our dynamic mining strategy changes its
control for every period as opposed to for every round. To quantify
the cost of mining with respect to the miner’s computational power,
we introduce c which is the ratio between the costC and the reward
R given that the miners comply to the protocol and use their full
power, i.e., C = c · R = c · nα if τ = 1. In other words, assuming
honest mining, c indicates the fraction of the reward which is used
for the electricity/power cost while 1 − c indicates the fraction of
the reward corresponding to the gross profit. c is constant given α .
Thus, the utility function in expectation assuming honest mining
is:U = R (1 − c ).
To recap, while α is given from the miner’s capability (e.g., the
investment amount for setting up the mining facilities and ca-
pabilities) and c is given from the electricity cost of the mining
setup/hardware, τ is fully controllable by the attacker and deter-
mines Ti (and thus
nT ), R and C . The consensus protocol provides
the fixed n and
cT .
2.4 Power Cost Model: C
While c is fixed and is defined given τ = 1 (assuming the miner
will use all of its power for mining), the power cost C depends on
the miner’s processing utilization for the PoW hash rate, τ . Due to
Figure 1: Power vs. hash rate in ourASICmining experiment
its importance in our analyses in Section 4, we establish the power
cost model in this section. The power cost C monotonically grows
between the power-off of τ = 0 and the full-power of τ = 1, the
latter at which the cost reaches its maximum of Cmax = c · α . In
addition, there is a positive base cost2 (which is the power cost
when the device is turned on but is otherwise resting) even when
there is no mining and τ → 0, and the power grows linearly with
the processing/hash rate from the base cost to cτ .
To validate our power cost model, Figure 1 shows our experi-
mental result on ASIC hardware for Bitcoin mining (GekkoScience
NewPac based on Bitmain’s BM 1387 ASIC chip). The hash rate is
controlled by the clock frequency (the hash rate increases with the
frequency) and the power was computed from measuring both the
current and the voltage of the ASIC mining hardware. The compu-
tational power increases with the hash rate. From the base power
cost in our measurement at 1.168 Watt, increasing the hash rate
monotonically increases the power until reaching the maximum
at 5.261 Watt achieving 59 · 109 hash computations per second.
Our power model informed by our measurements corroborates
with the general power model characterizing processing and power
relations, e.g., [3, 14, 17].
3 DYNAMIC I-O MINING
We describe I-O Mining in this section and analyze it later in Sec-
tion 4, including the incentive compatibility (greater reward than
full-power mining or no mining). I-O Mining is an energy-efficient
mining strategy where the miner alternates and switches back and
forth between mining with full power of τ = 1 in one period (power
off or “I”) and inactivity/no mining of τ = 0 in the adjacent period
(corresponding to the power off or “O”). The name of the scheme
comes from the use of I-O for indicating power on and off statuses
on a power switch, which symbol is . The miner will always
choose ∆τ = ±1 for every period transition, and only one of those
values are viable per transition (e.g., if τ = 1, then ∆τ , 1 and
∆τ = −1 because 0 ≤ τ + ∆τ ≤ 1). Therefore, in I-O Mining, the
miner chooses ∆τ = −1 to transition from the I state (τ = 1) to
the O state (τ = 0) and chooses ∆τ = −1 for the transition in the
reverse direction.
2
The base cost is platform-dependent and can be as large as 60% for laptops, 48% for
single-board computers (e.g., Raspberry Pi), and 3.5% for power-efficient embedded
platforms [3].
49
CryBlock’20, September 25, 2020, London, United Kingdom Sang-Yoon Chang and Simeon Wuthier
I-O Mining leverages the fact that the miner contributes to the
mining (and the overall network’s hash rate) and therefore affects
the period duration. The rational miner can control the computa-
tional power it uses for one period to influence the period duration
(shift the distribution) and therefore the block difficulty of the
upcoming period (which is inversely proportional to the aforemen-
tioned period duration the miner influenced). Given a finite energy
constraint, I-O Mining maximizes the reward because it maximally
shifts the difficulty to be the lowest/easiest and then consumes
energy only in those periods.
However, unless our aim is to reduce the energy use (e.g., green
computing), a more typical miner is supported by an electricity
infrastructure with practically unlimited energy but a finite-bound
cost in power (cost per energy use). In such case with unlimited en-
ergy but finite power cost, the miner will be interested in maximiz-
ing the utility U over time. Therefore, we investigate the incentive
of the I-O mining strategy in a power-limited regime (with limited
power cost and limited computational power/hash rate but infinite
energy), e.g., the miner has no externally influenced, foreseeable
time/energy limit in participating in mining.
4 I-O MINING ANALYSES
We build on our system model in Section 2 and analyze I-O Min-
ing in this section. We analyze the effect, superiority over honest
mining (no gaming), and profitability of I-O Mining. In this section,
we achieve the following significant results. First, we identify the
region/condition where I-O Mining outperforms τ = 1. Second, we
quantify the reward-profit gain. Third, we study when I-O Mining
is profitable (greater reward than cost and therefore better than
disabling mining altogether) and show that it is profitable even
in some cases where the electricity cost would have exceeded the
expected reward if the miner had adopted honest mining, i.e., c > 1.
4.1 τ Control and Effect
Dynamic miner controls τ to control the hash rate and the power of
the miner. The miner’s τ affects the expected period duration, E[nT ]
and the block difficulty for the next period (inversely proportional
to the previous
nT ). Since the block difficulty for the upcoming
period is only dependent on the last period (and not the periods
before), we investigate the effect by changing the miner’s control
parameter by ∆τ in the upcoming period. In other words, the miner
changes from τ to τ +∆τ between the periods where 0 ≤ τ +∆τ ≤ 1.
Before the miner changes its hash rate by ∆τ , the consensus
protocol adjusts the block difficulty so that E[
nT ] = cT for the
round if the miner kept its hash rate power of τ (no change and
∆τ = 0). However, the miner changing its hash rate by ∆τ affects
the actual period duration to become:
E[
nT ] = cT
1 − α + ατ
1 − α + α (τ + ∆τ )
(1)
If ∆τ > 0, then the period duration decreases and, if ∆τ < 0, then
the period duration increases in expectation. (At the end of this
period, the block difficulty gets adjusted by
(
1−α+ατ
1−α+α (τ+∆τ )
)−1
so
that, in the next period, E[
nT ] = cT if the total mining power
remains the same at 1 − α + α (τ + ∆τ ).)
Figure 2: (c,α )-region for I-O Mining
While the miner reward is R = ατ , the expected power cost, C
monotonically increases with
nT and therefore decreasing τ by ∆τ
reduces both the reward and the cost.
4.2 Superiority: Comparison with Static τ = 1
In this section, we compare I-O Mining and the static mining of
τ = 1, which corresponds to honest mining with no gaming. In the
next section of Section 4.3, we study the profitability and compare
it with the no-mining case of τ = 0.
The utility of the static mining of τ = 1 is the following:
Uτ=1 = Rτ=1 −Cτ=1 = nα (1 − c ) (2)
where the miner is expected to earn block rewards of nα and con-
sume nc for the electricity cost in each period.
The utility of the I-O Mining is the weighted average between
the I-state mining (yielding RI and CI ) and the O-state mining
(yielding RO and CO );

The reward-profit gain for I-O Mining over the static strategy of
always-full-power mining isUIO −Uτ=1, i.e., the difference between
Equation 3 and Equation 2. The exact values for I-O Mining’s gain
over the static τ = 1 depends on the miner setup, including its
computational power capability (α ) and the cost-to-reward ratio
(c), and the period duration in the number of blocks/rounds (n).
Comparing the two yields the region where I-O Mining outper-
forms mining with full power.
Theorem 1. A miner is incentivized to launch I-O Mining over
full-power mining if α3 − 2α2 + α + 1 − 1
c > 0.
50
Dynamic Power Control for Rational Cryptocurrency Mining CryBlock’20, September 25, 2020, London, United Kingdom
Proof. Using Equation 2 and Equation 3,UIO −Uτ=1 > 0 yields
α3 − 2α2 + α + 1 − 1
c > 0. □
Theorem 1 provides a (c,α )-region where I-O Mining outper-
forms the static mining of τ = 1. As a corollary, I-O Mining is more
relevant (reward gain over full-power mining) when c is closer to
1, i.e., the electricity cost is closer to the reward, not leaving much
profit. More specifically, if c < 0.871, then I-O Mining is always
suboptimal compared to full-power mining. Figure 2 shows the
(c,α )-region where I-O Mining outperforms honest mining.
4.3 Profitability: Comparison with Static τ = 0
We investigate the profitability of I-O Mining where mining is
profitable if it yields greater utility function than that when there
is no mining and power is off (in which case, the utility function
is zero since there is no reward and no cost). For the static mining
of τ = 1, using Equation 2, Uτ=1 > Uτ=0 = 0 ⇐⇒ c < 1, which is
also intuitive by the definition of c .
For I-O Mining, we establish that the upper bound for the cost-
to-reward ratio, given τ = 1, c is even greater than one.
Theorem 2. I-O Mining is profitable if c < 1
1−α .
Proof. Using Equation 3, U
IO
> 0 yields c < 1
1−α . □
Theorem 2 provides an upper bound for c to make I-O Mining
profitable (positive profit gain over nomining), and the upper bound
is greater than or equal to one, i.e.,
1
1−α ≥ 1 (equality holds when
α = 0). This theorem is significant since it establishes that I-O
Mining is incentivized over not mining even if the cost-to-reward
ratio is greater than one (i.e., the electricity cost would have been
greater than the expected reward if the static full-power mining
had been used), because the miner manipulates the block difficulty
in order to mine in an energy-efficient manner and decrease the
expected duration for mining.
4.4 Negative Impact on Overall Blockchain
I-O Mining hinders the transaction scalability and reduces the block
generation rate of the overall blockchain network than the static
honest mining (no gaming), even though the strategy can increase
the subject miner’s own reward.
Theorem 3. I-O Mining yields smaller overall block generation
rate than honest mining with full power.
Proof. The expected period duration in Equation 1 is convex
with respect to ∆τ . Jensen’s Inequality yields that I-O Mining takes
longer to produce the same number of blocks than the static-mining
case where τ = 0.5 and ∆τ = 0 (static mining using half the power
capability) in expectation. The static-mining case where τ = 0.5
and ∆τ = 0 takes longer to produce blocks than the static-mining
case of τ = 1 and ∆τ = 0 (honest mining with full power) in
expectation. □
5 PRACTICALITY OF I-O MINING
In Section 4, we show that I-O Mining is better than the static
strategy of τ = 1 (honest mining and no gaming) and is profitable
(better than the static strategy ofτ = 0). Theorem 1 provides that I-O
Mining is more relevant (greater incentives than τ = 1) as c grows
larger, and Theorem 2 yields that I-O Mining is profitable even
when c > 1 and up to c < 1
1−α . Therefore, I-O Mining becomes
increasingly practically relevant (i.e., the miner will launch I-O
Mining over either τ = 1 or τ = 0) as the cost-to-reward ratio c
(given the ordinary mining of τ = 1) increases.
In mining in practice, c generally increases with time in the
lifetime of a miner as there are increasing competitions and tech-
nological advancements, increasing the block difficulty and the
per-miner computational effort. Therefore, once setting up the
miner, c generally increases until the miner eventually becomes
outdated and no longer competitive compared to the overall miner
network. Furthermore, cryptocurrencies decrease the block rewards
to limit the new currencies to provide a stable currency and avoid
the risk of hyperinflation; e.g., Bitcoin has a scheduled plan for such
implementation to decrease the new Bitcoins to circulation and,
more specifically, halves new currency in its amount every 210,000
blocks (or 4 years) until it reaches 21 million BTC cap (no more
new currency afterward); such decrease in block reward increases
c in the lifetime of a miner. As c increases, our work provides a
region when the profit-seeking miner will switch to I-O Mining for
maximizing its reward in Theorem 1. As c increases, I-O Mining
also prolongs the profitability and therefore the validity/use of the
mining setup in Theorem 2 before permanently shutting down the
miner (equivalent to τ = 0).
6 RELATEDWORK IN BLOCKCHAIN MINING
Previous literature in blockchain investigates the incentive compat-
ibility of the PoW distributed consensus protocol. In the seminal
Bitcoin paper, Nakamoto designs the PoW-based consensus protocol
to be incentive compatible (so that the rational attacker’s strategy
reduces to protocol compliance) as long as the rational miner’s
computational power is less than 50% the network’s [12]. If not,
the miner compromising majority of the network’s computational
power can launch the 51% attack and can revoke transactions for
double spending. The mining incentives driving participation are
therefore critical in reducing the security risk because greater par-
ticipation in the consensus protocol increases the barrier for attack
feasibility. Since the seminal Bitcoin paper, other mining strategies
has emerged which violate the PoW protocol and are incentive com-
patible (earning greater reward profits). These strategies are based
on withholding/controlling the timing of the blocks, including self-
ish mining [5, 6] and block withholding [4, 6, 8, 10, 13]. Ongoing
research includes lightweight and deployable countermeasures to
these strategies, e.g., [13, 15], and the next-generation consensus
protocols informed by these strategies, e.g., [1].
Particularly relevant to our work studying the PoW mining in-
centives are those investigating the impact of the adaptive difficulty
for mining. Although the mining protocol is generally designed to
be robust against a mining attacker with respect to the dynamic dif-
ficulty [7], the coin-flipping attack switches between two coins so
that the going back and forth enables the miner to mine both coins
when they have lower difficulty [11]. Such strategy, however, as-
sumes that the attacking miner can choose different coins, which is
generally not supported by the mining hardwares, especially those
based on application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC’s) which
boast significantly larger power and hash rates than GPU’s or
CPU’s. Barring few exceptions (e.g., a mining hardware can be
used between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash [9]), the mining hardwares

are designed and fabricated for specific coins (and often for specific
pools) and therefore support specific/fixed coin. Our work therefore
does not require or consider coin-hopping capabilities (which can
involve hardware-based switching and engineering expertise), in
contrast to these previous research.
Other researchers investigate the emergingmining strategies and
the incentive issues of the current consensus protocols as the block
reward transitions to only variable transaction-fees (as opposed to
also including the base fees that generate new currencies) [2, 16].
The variance of the block reward amount incentivizes the attackers
to selectively mine the blocks in time (e.g., there are “mining gaps”
when the attackers decide not to mine). Although related, our work
is orthogonal to these issues since I-O Mining maximizes the re-
ward advantage given the block reward amount, e.g., our analyses
normalizes the reward with respect to the block reward amount.
Also, while these prior work analyzes the strategy within a round
(transaction fees vary in time within a round), our work focuses
on the inter-rounds across blocks where the dependency across
the rounds exist due to the difficulty control. The decrease in the
base fees (for generating new currencies), however, would actually
further motivate I-O Mining because it can reduce the gap between
the reward and the power cost, as investigated in Section 4.
7 CONCLUSION & FUTUREWORK
This paper studies dynamic mining for rational miners in PoW
blockchain. I-O Mining toggles between the I-state (mining with
full power) and O-state (power off) in order to be energy-efficient
by taking advantage of the dependency across blocks arising from
the block-difficulty adaptation of the cryptocurrency protocol. The
absence of mining in the O-state lowers the block difficulty and
therefore makes the mining in the I-state that much more efficient.
Our results indicate that I-O Mining can also be power-efficient
(yield greater profit per time given unlimited electrical energy sup-
ply) and outperform the static full-power mining (which has been
known to be incentive compatible until our work). I-O Mining is
especially effective when the mining setup is generally low in gross
profit (i.e., the cost is relatively high compared to the earnings from
the block reward) and can prolong the use and the profitability of
the mining equipment, including some mining rounds where the
electricity cost would have exceeded the block reward if the miner
had used static full-power mining (protocol compliance with no
gaming). I-O Mining introduces a strategy gaming the blockchain
mining, violating the design integrity of blockchain/cryptocurrency,
and hindering the transaction scalability.
Our paper informs the blockchain and cryptocurrency research
of dynamic rational mining, and we urge the research community to
better align the consensus protocol participation incentives. There
are multiple potential directions for future research. First, the sys-
tem model can incorporate other relevant mining factors to analyze
their impacts on mining for a greater systems analysis. For exam-
ple, the model can capture the miner hardware/setup decreasing in
competitiveness with respect to time or combine dynamic mining
with other rational mining strategies, such as those in Section 6.
Second, the dynamic mining analyses can improve, e.g., the Nash
equilibrium analysis or generalizing the power control for finer
granularity beyond the binary option of on or off. Third, to pro-
vide solutions for resolving the rational miners gaming the system,
the potential countermeasures can include: a more sophisticated
algorithm for adjusting the block difficulty (such as period control
or different weight allocations for each blocks), a novel reward
distribution scheme, and a chain-level monitoring scheme based
on reward/block behavior.
