Abstract. Healthcare facilities spend a lot of resources on taking care of
patients while they recover from their illnesses. IoT (Internet of Things)
devices are used to monitor and control the environment of healthcare
facilities. According to Spanish standards of hygiene and safety in hospi-
tals: the temperature must be between 18 ◦ and 24 ◦C and relative humid-
ity of 60%. In this paper, we present a cooperative control algorithm
to increase data quality and false data detection via edge computing in
healthcare facilities. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that blockchain can
be used to store data in an immutable and secure way. In this work we
present a new model for the efficient control and monitoring of indoor
temperature in healthcare facilities, reducing energy consumption and
storing data in a secure and immutable way via blockchain.

1 Introduction
In the last few years, the term blockchain has been very frequently used among
the scientific community. Gartner proposed in July 2016 that blockchain was a
distributed database. First described by Nakamoto in 2008, he developed the con-
cept of Bitcoin, an encryption-based virtual currency. Today, Bitcoin is the most
advanced application of blockchain and the most advanced technological concept
in academia. However, blockchain has many more applications in other fields
and industries. Since Bitcoin’s blockchain only serves to store cryptocurrency
transactions, other blockchain systems have been developed (e.g., Ethereum)
for making smart contracts and storing a wide variety of data. Ethereum is a
decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly
as programmed, without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-
party interference. This enables developers to store registries of data, move funds
in accordance with instructions given long in the past (like a will or a future

contract) and many other things that have not been invented yet, all without a
middleman or counterparty risk. Ethereum makes it possible to establish smart
contracts between several parties. Several actions are involved in the process of
making smart contracts in the blockchain. To build a block with the data col-
lected by the smart nodes, the smart contract runs. Once the block is validated
by the miners, it can be introduced into the blockchain. Furthermore, since net-
work consensus is always necessary, altering records becomes very difficult and
expensive. This prevents individuals or groups from changing a blockchain record
with the effort of trying to make false data look precise and authentic [5].
One of the problems detected by the authors in monitoring and controlling
the environment in which patients recover is that the temperature in the rooms
is not constant. There are several reasons for this, one of the main causes is
that the patients’ family members may change the temperature of their ther-
mostats, open the windows of their rooms, etc. As a consequence of temperature
fluctuations, patients have more difficulties in restoring their health. Further-
more, to ensure that patients are at the temperatures that are recommended by
national regulations, many resources are wasted on heating and cooling. This
results in low-quality healthcare as professionals are limited by the control sys-
tems available to them. Therefore, we consider it necessary to develop a new
e-health model that will have all the functionalities required for monitoring and
controlling temperature in healthcare facilities. There have been attempts to use
multi-agent systems to optimize and improve the e-health system [2] however,
the implementation of a WSN does not eliminate the key problems of centralized
systems [6].
In this paper, a new temperature control system is proposed for use in the
field of e-Health. This new system has an architecture with an edge computing
layer in which data is transformed by applying an algorithm to improve data
quality and false data detection. In this way, it is possible to improve efficiency
in monitoring healthcare facilities. In the case study presented in this paper,
IoT devices monitored the temperature of a healthcare facility. The coopera-
tive algorithm that is executed in edge computing layer increases data quality
by using game theory to reach temperature consensuses between IoT e-health
devices and auto-correcting the inaccurate temperatures. Thus, the use of energy
to heat or cold healthcare facilities can be optimized, offering a better-quality
service to the patients. On the other hand, blockchain technology is used in this
system to store temperatures. Thus, only authorized staff have access to this
data. This paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 reviews the literature related to
blockchain. Section 3 proposes the architecture and the cooperative algorithm.
Section 6 draws conclusions from the conducted research.
2 Related Work
Many researchers have done paramount studies on networking architectures. In
the field of medicine the literature features examples of architectures for IoT
in various fields such as military health services on the battlefield [22], ambi-
ent assisted living applications [17], patient health monitoring system [12] and
Cooperative Algorithm Healthcare 51
hospitalized patient monitoring [7]. Other researchers use the support of IoT
architectures to present their algorithms for e-health [9]. Some of the latest work
in this field is the use of algorithms to detect Alzheimer’s disease [27], algo-
rithms for monitoring and alerting system [16], regular monitoring of arthritis
disease [20] and early detection of heart diseases [15,31]. In this line our research
focuses on presenting an algorithm to monitor and control temperature in patient
recovery environments. To achieve this, we present an IoT architecture for smart
Hospital in which the proposed algorithm can be used. Many researchers ass-
sume that “WSNs are subsets of IoT”. WSNs are used to control and monitor
a wide range of things [11,32]. Some works achieve good results in fields such
as energy efficiency using WSNs [3], control of operations [8], optimal routing
in WSNs [26,33], and some other applications such as social good [21]. Sensor
networks can also be used with other technologies such as multi-agent systems
to manage data [26], for data mining [23], multi-agent localization and WSN.
These algorithms are also being used for data mining [1,34]. Moreover, WSNs
and GT are the areas that are currently undergoing intense study, [10] is focused
on finding innovative solutions to the challenges presented by next-generation
WSNs. Since GT is an ideal tool for designing efficient and robust distributed
algorithms, its use in the design and analysis of WSN information is attracting
increased attention [19,35]. This survey looks at how GT is currently being used
in WSNs. In [25,36] the authors make a general classification of the different
uses of GT in WSNs; they are classified into the following groups: network man-
agement, communication, network security and applications. Our proposal can
be included in the applications category, within the data collection subgroup.
Existing works provide diverse frameworks for blockchain and IoT. More-
over, applications that merge both technologies are being developed. One of
the earliest development was an application that authenticates and increases
the reliability of WSNs using blockchain [4,37] [18,38]. Other applications also
combine the Internet of Things and the global commerce [13,39]. Regarding the
blockchain-based architectures, Q. Xia et al. [28] provide a framework for the
exchange of health data based on a blockchain that addresses the access con-
trol challenges associated with sensitive data stored in the cloud. The system
is based on a blockchain with permissions that allow access only to invited and
therefore verified users. Yue et al. [29] present an architecture based on 3 layers:
data usage layer, data management layer and data storage layer. This paper dis-
cusses the use of a private blockchain that acts as a cloud. Kuo et al. [14] make
an in-depth revision of the latest biomedical/sanitary applications of blockchain
technologies. The authors discuss the potential changes that these applications
and architectures need and suggest solutions using the blockchain technology in
the biomedical/sanitary field. In contrast to this work focused on the exchange
of health data, [24,40] and [30] focus on other problems. Shae et al. [24] propose
a blockchain-based architecture for clinical trials and precision medicine. Zhao
et al. [30] use a WSN to design a lightweight backup and efficient recovery
scheme for healthcare systems. This is a pioneering work in blockchain key man-

agement, while its performance is heavily influenced by the state of the hardware
and environment.
The methods presented in the reviewed literature overcome different chal-
lenges concerning e-health. IoT architectures and blockchain-based architectures
are presented in response to several issues detected by researchers. However, we
observed a gap in the literature review since there are no algorithms that could
automatically validate the temperature collected by a heterogeneous WSN. In
our work, coalitions of neighbours are created by using clustering techniques.
This distributed and self-organized (overall temperature equilibrium arises from
local game interactions between sensors of an initially disordered temperature
system) game is designed to provide reliability and robustness to the data col-
lected by a WSN. It identifies defective sensors gathering inaccurate measure-
ments and detects areas with similar temperatures. This article tackles the prob-
lem of reliability of WSN data from the point of view of game theory and prob-
ability, which is a novel approach in this field.
3 Proposed Architecture
The main goal of this work is to present a cooperative control algorithm that
improves data quality of the temperature collected by the smart WSN nodes.
To achieve our goal, we propose an architecture that allows to monitor and
control the temperature of healthcare facilities. Through the literature review,
we present a 3-layer architecture: data collection layer, data management layer
and data storage and security layer.
3.1 Proposed System Architecture
This architecture has 3 layers: (1) Data collection layer. Sensors collect data from
the environment or object under measurement and turn it into useful data. Data
is at the core of an IoT architecture, and we have to decide between the imme-
diacy and depth of knowledge when processing these data. The more immediate
the need for information, the closer to the end devices your processing needs to
be. The data from the sensors is started in analog form. The DAS connects to
the WSN, adds inputs and carries out the transformation from analog to digi-
tal. The Internet gateway receives the digitized data and routes it to the data
management layer for further processing. Here, temperature sensors monitor the
temperature of healthcare facilities. (2) Data management layer. Once data has
been digitized it is ready to enter the data management layer. However, data
may require processing before entering the storage layer. This is where edge
computing systems come into play, they perform more analyses. Usually, devices
that are in the edge computing system sit in the facility or location where the
sensors reside closer to the sensors (i.e., Smart controller). Digitized data is sent
to the smart controllers. Then, the Raspberry Pi first runs a cooperative con-
trol algorithm to improve data quality and false data detection. Once data is
transformed by the cooperative control algorithm, Raspberry Pi sends the data
Cooperative Algorithm Healthcare 53
to the sidechain (this sidechain is Rinkeby, a fork of Ethereum) that builds the
block with the data sent to it by the IoT nodes. Once the block is built in the
sidechain, the Raspberry Pi runs a smart contract in the Ethereum blockchain
(i.e., main chain) to validate the sidechain of a new block. If the block is vali-
dated, the Raspberry Pi sends the block to the miners’ network for storage in the
blockchain. (3) Storage and security layer. In blockchain network, there are two
important entities: Miners and verifiers. Miners refer to the nodes who produce
new blocks for the blockchain. Different application scenarios may define differ-
ent nodes as the miners. New blocks are accepted only after validation by the
verifiers, which are responsible for verifying the new blocks’ authenticity. Pro-
cesses of generation, verification and inclusion of new blocks in the blockchain
are called mining. To ensure the safety and reliability of mining processes, the
consensus mechanism is critical in the blockchain network. In this work, transac-
tions denote the temperature of the healthcare facilities records in the system. In
relation to our work, Ethereum blockchain is introduced in the e-Health system
to store and manage the temperature, which helps to improve the recovery time.

Ethereum blockchain, which provides a mechanism to execute logic and manage node
interactions via smart contracts. Nodes share a blockchain database and communicate
over the blockchain.
4 Cooperative Control Algorithm
The cooperative control algorithm requires the data to be in a matrix. Therefore,
the first transformation that data has is to place them in an ordered mesh from
point (1,1) to point (n,n) so that each of these points matches the position of the
smart nodes. From the mesh it is easy to create a matrix in which the cooperative
54 R. Casado-Vara et al.
control algorithm is applied. Without loss of generality, if we have a mesh with
n sensors ordered from (1,1) to (n,n), matrix shown in Eq. 1 is created.
Tn,n =
⎛
⎜⎝
ts1,1 . . . ts1,n
...
. . .
...
tsn,1 . . . tsn,n
⎞
⎟⎠ (1)
4.1 Mathematical Description of the Algorithm
Let n ≥ 2 denote the number of players in the game, numbered from 1 to n,
and let N = {1, 2,...,n} denote the set of players. A coalition, S, is defined
to be a subset of N, S ⊆ N , and the set of all coalitions is denoted by S.
A cooperative game in N is a function u (characteristic feature of the game)
that assigns to each coalition Si ⊆ S a real number u(Si). In addition one has
the condition u(∅) = 0. In our case, the game will be non-negative (the values of
the characteristic function are always positive), monotonous (if more players are
added to the coalition the value of the expected characteristic function does not
change), simple and 0-normalized (players are obliged to cooperate with each
other since individually they will obtain zero benefit).
In our case, the set of players is the set of ordered sensors S and the charac-
teristic function u is defined as:
u : 2n −→ {0, 1} (2)
such that, for each coalition of sensors, u = 1 or 0 if that particular coalition
can vote or not respectively (see Eq. (2, 3)).
S � Si −→ u(Si) = {0, 1} ∈ R (3)
where R are the Real numbers.
4.2 Cooperative Sensor Coalitions
The possible coalitions that the sensors will form, will be limited by their posi-
tion, that is, the coalitions can only be formed by neighbouring sensors. Let’s
consider the matrix of the sensors and a pair of sensors si,j and sk,m will be in
the same neighbourhood if and only if:
‖ (i − k)2 − (j − m)2 ‖≤ 1 (4)
that is, if each sensor to which the game is applied, is the center of a Von
Neumann neighbourhood, its neighbours are those lying within a Manhattan
distance (in the matrix) equal to one. In addition, the following conditions have
to be fulfilled by the allowed coalitions:
1. Coalition sensors have to be in the same neighborhood as defined in Eq. 4.
2. Coalitions cannot be formed by a single sensor.
Cooperative Algorithm Healthcare 55
4.3 A Characteristic Function to Find cooperative temperatures.
In the proposed game, we want the neighbourhood coalitions to democratically
decide the temperature of the main sensor. To do this, they will form coalitions
that will decide on the final temperature of the sensor, which will be determined
by whether they can vote or not in the process. From the characteristic function
defined in Eq. (2), if the value is 1(0), the coalition can vote (not vote) respec-
tively. si is the main sensor with its associated temperature tsi
, the characteristic
function is built in the following way:
1. First, the average temperature of all the sensors is calculated:
T k
si
=
1
V
V∑
i
tsi
(5)
here T 1
si
represents the average temperature of the sensors’ neighbourhood
si (including it) in the first iteration of the game and V is the number of
neighbours in the coalition.
2. The next step is to compute an absolute value for the temperature difference
between the temperatures of each sensor and the average temperature:
T
k
si
=
(
1
V
V∑
i
| tsi
− T k
si
|2
) 1
2
(6)
3. Using the differences in temperature values with regards to the average
temperature T
k
si
(see Eq. (6)) a confidence interval is created and defined
as follows:
Iksi
=
(
T k
si
± t(V −1,α
2 )
T
k
si√
V
)
(7)
in Eq. (7) we use the Student’s-t distribution with an error of 1%.
4. In this step we use a hypothesis test. If the temperature of the sensor lies in
the interval Iksi
, it belongs to the voting coalition, otherwise, it is not in the
voting coalition:
uk(s1, . . . , sn) =
{
1 if tsi
∈ Iksi
0 if tsi
�∈ Iksi
(8)
5. The characteristic function will repeat this process iteratively (k is the number
of the iteration) until all the sensors in that iteration belong to the voting
coalition. In each iteration k, the following payoff vector of the coalition Sj
(with 1 ≤ j ≤ n where n is the number of sensors in the coalition) in the step
k (PV (Sk
j )) is available:
PV (Sk
j ) = (uk(s1), . . . , uk(sn)) where
n∑
i
uk(si) ≤ n (9)
56 R. Casado-Vara et al.
The stop condition of the game iterations is PV (Sk
j ) = PV (Sk+1
j ) the pro-
cess end. That is, let PV (Sk
j ) = (uk(s1), . . . , uk(sn)) and let PV (Sk+1
j ) =
(uk+1(s1), . . . , uk+1(sn)). The iteration process ends when both payoff vectors
contain the same elements. This process is shown in the following equation:
⎧⎪⎨
⎪⎩
uk(s1) = uk+1(s1)
...
uk(sn) = uk+1(sn)
(10)
Solution Concept of the Cooperative Game. Once the characteristic func-
tion has been applied to all sensors involved in this step of the game a payoff
vector in the step k is available (see Eq. 9). Since the proposed game is a coop-
erative game, the solution concept is a coalition of players that we have called
game equilibrium (GE). The GE of the proposed game is defined as the minimal
coalition with more than half of the votes cast. Let n be the number of players
involved in this step of the game. Winning coalition must satisfy the following
conditions:
1. Sum of the elements of the coalition PV must be higher than half plus 1 of
the votes cast:
n∑
i
uk(si) ≥ n
2
+ 1 (11)
2. The coalition is maximal (i.e., coalition with the greatest number of elements,
different from 0, in its payoff vector PV (Sk
j )).
Therefore, the solution to the proposed game is the coalition that verifies both
conditions from among all possible coalitions that are formed at each step k of
the game.
4.4 Temperatures of the Winning Coalition
Once the characteristic function decides which is the winning coalition, it is
possible to calculate the temperature of the main sensor. Let {s1, . . . , sj} be the
winning coalition’s sensors and {ts1 , . . . , tsj
} be their associated temperature.
The temperature that the game has voted to be the main sensor’s tempera-
ture (MST) is calculated as follows:
MST = max
j∈|Swinner|
{j ∗ tsi
}si∈Swinner
(12)
where |S| is the number of elements in the winning coalition. Therefore, the
MST will be the maximum temperature that has the highest relative frequency.
In case of a draw, it is resolved by the Lagrange criterion.
Cooperative Algorithm Healthcare 57
Diffuse Convergence. In each game iteration, there is a matrix with temper-
ature (see Eq. 1). Hence we define a sequence of arrays {Mn}n∈N where the Mi
element corresponds to the temperature matrix in step i of the game. Therefore,
it can be said that the sequence of matrices is convergent if:
∀ε > 0, there is N ∈ N such that |Mi−1 − Mi| ≤ ε ∀i ∈ N. (13)
That is, if the element mi−1
n,m ∈ Mi−1 and the element mi
n,m ∈ Mi are set and
the convergence criterion is applied, we have:
∀εn,m > 0 there is N ∈ N such that |mi−1
n,m − mi
n,m| ≤ εn,m
∀i ∈ N , ∀i ≥ N and mi−1
n,m ∈ Mi−1,m
i
n,m ∈ Mi
(14)
Therefore, by applying the criterion of convergence in Eq. (14) to all the ele-
ments, a new matrix is obtained with the temperature differences between the
temperatures obtained in previous and in the next step of the game.
⎛
⎜⎝
|mi−1
1,1 − mi
1,1| . . . |mi−1
1,m − mi

...
. . .
...
|mi−1
n,1 − mi
n,1| . . . |mi−1
n,m − mi
n,m|
⎞
⎟⎠ (15)
For the succession of matrices to be convergent, each of the sequences of elements
that are formed with the |mi−1
n,m − mi
n,m| must be less than the fixed ε > 0. In
this work, it is established that ε = 0.01. The game reach the equilibrium if at
least 80% of the elements of the matrix are convergent.
5 Empirical Results of the Case Study
In this case study the temperature of a recovery unit of a hospital in Salamanca
(Spain) was collected. The IoT nodes collect data from the rooms and corridors.
Then, the cooperative algorithm is used to increase the quality of the collected
data and false data detection. In this way the hospital can monitor the tempera-
ture of the environment more effectively. Finally, data that has been transformed
is stored in the blockchain. Once the mesh is made with the position of the IoT
temperature nodes, the temperature is collected and stored in a matrix. In this
case study, the cooperative algorithm is executed in the edge computing layer,
transforms data before it reaches blockchain. The type of sensor used (in the
IoT temperature nodes) is a combination of the ESP8266 microcontroller in its
commercial version “ESP-01” and a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
(Fig. 1). Their combination allows for greater flexibility when collecting data and
adaptability to the case study, since the DHT11 sensor is designed for indoor
environments (has an operating range of between 0 ◦C and 50 ◦C) according to its
datasheet. The microcontroller collects data from this sensor through a onewire
protocol and communicates it to the environment via WiFi using HTTP stan-
dards and GET/POST requests. The device is programmed using the ESP-IDF
programming environment provided by the manufacturer of the microcontroller.

Fig. 2. Evolution of surface temperatures over the different steps in the game until
reaching game equilibrium.
In Fig. 2, the first image shows the initial temperature and in the rest of
the images the iterations of the game until the GE is reached. In the successive
images, the temperature clusters are being formed, this can be observed by the
changes in the colour gradient. It can also be seen that some areas with inaccu-
rate temperatures self-correct smoothly on the basis of the temperatures in their
environment. This is the intended process, since the game is executing its iter-
ations depending on the environment surrounding the sensor. This makes sense
because the temperature of the sensor will be similar to the average tempera-
ture of the environment in which it is located. Also, we show the evolution of the
temperature on the surface. To this end, we have represented the temperature
on the z axis to facilitate visualization in the form of a surface.
Experimental results about convergence and sensors that are providing inac-
curate measurements are shown in Fig. 3. In the graph on the left it can be
found that the algorithm reaches the diffuse convergence defined in this paper
(i.e., 80% of the elements of the matrix reach convergence). The algorithm takes
less than 10 steps to produce reliable temperatures relative to their neighbors.
On the other hand, on the right side of the figure, the number of sensors that are
performing inaccurate measurements (assuming a 0.01 ◦C error) is 15%. While
in 10 stages of the algorithm this number decreases below 5%. The algorithm
increases the number of sensors that are providing precise temperatures accord-
ing to their neighbors in less than 10 steps.
Cooperative Algorithm Healthcare 59
Fig. 3. Left: The algorithm achieves convergence in less than 10 steps. While from
the 50 stages onwards the temperatures reach the optimal temperature regarding to
their neighborhood. Right: Assuming that we have allowed an error of 0.01 ◦C, at the
first step of the algorithm one notices that 15% of the sensors are providing inaccurate
temperatures. Once 10 stages of the algorithm have occurred, sensors that are sensing
imprecise temperatures are under 5%.
6 Conclusions
This paper presents a distributed and self-organized cooperative algorithm using
game theory. The algorithm has been applied to data collected by IoT e-health
devices. In addition, a blockchain-based architecture is suggested to improve data
security. The novelty of this architecture lies in the fact that it provides an edge
computing layer in which the cooperative algorithm is executed to improve data
quality and the detection of false data. On the other hand, this new algorithm
improves the energy efficiency of healthcare facilities by applying algorithms in
the edge computing layer.
