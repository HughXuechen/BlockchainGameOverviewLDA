ABSTRACT
We study the competition between blockchains in a multi-chain
environment, where a dominant EVM-compatible blockchain (e.g.,
Ethereum) co-exists with an alternative EVM-compatible (e.g., Avalanche)
and an EVM-incompatible (e.g., Algorand) blockchain. While EVM
compatibility allows existing Ethereum users and developers to
migrate more easily over to the alternative layer-1, EVM incompat-
ibility might allow the firms to build more loyal and “sticky” user
base, and in turn a more robust ecosystem. As such, the choice to
be EVM-compatible is not merely a technological decision, but also
an important strategic decision. In this paper, we develop a game
theoretic model to study this competitive dynamic, and find that at
equilibrium, new entrants/developers tend to adopt the dominant
blockchain. To avoid adoption failure, the alternative blockchains
have to either (1) directly subsidize the new entrant firms or (2) offer
better features, which in practice can take form in lower transaction
costs, faster finality, or larger network effects. We find that it is eas-
ier for EVM-compatible blockchains to attract users through direct
subsidy, while it is more efficient for EVM-incompatible blockchains
to attract users through offering better features/products.

and user adoption, there are a number of other layer-1 projects that
are gaining significant market shares. Some of them are Ethereum
Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible (e.g. Avalanche, NEAR-Aurora,
and Polkadot-Moonbeam), which makes them relatively easy for
both Ethereum developers and users to adopt, since they share the
same peripheral tools and applications (e.g. same programming
languages, wallet software, chrome-plugins, block-explorers, and
better bridge supports). There are also blockchains that are not
EVM compatible (e.g. Solana and Algorand). Due to the relative
lack of compatible peripheral tools for these chains, there is often
significant friction for existing users on EVM compatible chains to
adopt non-EVM compatible chains, and vice-versa. As such, for both
blockchains and developers, the choice to be EVM-compatible is not
just a technological decision, but also an important strategic choice.
On the one hand, EVM compatibility makes it easier to attract
existing Ethereum users. Large existing user bases also generate
positive network effects. On the other hand, being incompatible
with EVMcreates a “lock-in” effect, whichmakes usersmore “sticky”
in the future, which allows developers to capture more surplus. In
this paper, we aim to answer two related questions:
(1) What types of blockchain platformswill developers and users
adopt? Will they choose Ethereum or other EVM-compatible
blockchains? orwill they adopt EVM-incompatible blockchains?
(2) What strategies can blockchain platforms deploy in order to
attract the adoption of developers and users?
We develop a two stage Bertrand competition game to examine
the incentives of firms and users in a multi-chain setting. We show
that at equilibrium, the new entrant firms/developers will adopt the
dominant blockchain with the most existing adoption, regardless
of whether or not the alternative blockchain is EVM compatible.
All else being equal, the incentives for a new entrant to build on
the dominant blockchain instead of an EVM-compatible alternative
chain is intuitive. The dominant blockchain offers the largest ex-
isting user base and the largest positive network effect. When the
new entrant builds on the same chain as the incumbent, they share
the positive network between all of their users. As such, they will
not compete as fiercely on price to attract users.
If the new entrant instead develops on the alternative EVM-
compatible blockchain, it will no longer share the network effect
with the incumbent firm, and will need to engage in intense price
competition with the firm on the dominant chain to attract users.
Since the alternative blockchain has a smaller existing user base
and network effect, the firm must be very aggressive in its’ pricing
strategy in order to attract users, resulting in smaller profits.
What about when the firm builds on an EVM-incompatible
blockchain? Since incompatibility makes it harder for users to
switch products, firms might be able to extract more surplus from

users if they are built on different incompatible blockchains. Sur-
prisingly, in this case, firms earn even less than the case when they
are built on the EVM-compatible alternative chain. The intuition is
that even though the firm can now extract more rent from users that
it has captured (due to higher user stickiness), it needs to engage
in more fierce price competition in the beginning to capture these
users in the first place. In fact, the competitive dynamic in the first
round of our two stage game is so strong that firms might even
offer negative price. This lowers the aggregate payoffs of the firm
adopting the EVM-incompatible blockchain.
To avoid this “winner takes all" equilibrium and attract the adop-
tion of firms and users, alternative blockchain platforms have to
either (1) directly subsidize the new firm, or (2) offer better features
(e.g. faster finality, and lower transaction costs).
We show that it is easier for EVM-compatible blockchains to
attract users via direct subsidy, while it is more efficient for EVM-
incompatible blockchains to attract users by offering better fea-
tures. More precisely, compared to EVM-incompatible blockchains,
EVM-compatible blockchains can attract the new entrant firm with
smaller subsidies. This is because, at equilibrium, when the new
firm is built on an EVM-compatible blockchain, the incumbent firm
adopts a less aggressive pricing scheme to attract users, which leads
to a larger profit margin for both firms.
A less direct way to attract firms to the alternative blockchain is
through offering better user experience and better features at the
blockchain level. As mentioned above, this can be in the form of
lower transaction fees and better security, but it can also be achieved
through more peripheral applications, and other complementary
services. When two firms offer a comparable service at the product
level, the one that is built on the better blockchain will be able
to attract more users. This in turn implies that the firm that is
built a superior blockchain will be able to charge a higher price,
and thus earn more profits. As a result, the new entrant firm will
choose this alternative blockchain. We show that in our model,
EVM-incompatible blockchains are able to more efficiently attract
more users using this approach, meaning that for each unit of
increase in blockchain quality, the EVM-incompatible chain is able
to attract more users than a EVM-compatible chain.
Literature review. The study of network effects [4] and switching
costs was an active research area from the 1980s to the early 2000s,
motivated by the then nascent industries of telecommunication
and software development platforms. A series of papers focused on
the effect of switching cost on competition [1, 5, 6]. These papers
showed that under different modeling assumptions, the presence of
switching cost tend to increase competition between the firms in
earlier periods. This is because switching cost increases the firms
ability to extract more surplus from their existing adopters, which
motivates the firms to compete more fiercely earlier on to capture
more new customers. Building upon these insights, more recent
papers [7, 9] model switching cost as a strategic decision by the
platform, and analyze the different settings when firms might want
to adopt a lock-in strategy by intentionally creating incompatibility
and thus switching costs. For a more comprehensive survey of these
topics, see also [2, 3, 8]. Our paper presents a model that combines
a few different elements from the existing literature, and presents
an analysis of the network effect and switching cost in the context
of blockchain applications.
2 MODEL DESCRIPTION
Let there be three blockchain platforms: two EVM-compatible
blockchains, 𝑃1 and 𝑃2, and one EVM-incompatible blockchain,
𝑃3. There are two firms, an incumbent 𝐴 on 𝑃1, and a new entrant
𝐵.
Blockchain Platforms. Blockchains 𝑃1 ,𝑃2, and 𝑃3 have existing
user bases 𝑁1 ,𝑁2, and 𝑁3 respectively. A larger user base leads to
a larger positive network effect for users, and firms account for this
effect when choosing platforms. We assume that 𝑁1 > 𝑁2 = 𝑁3.
That is, the EVM-compatible blockchain 𝑃1 has the largest existing
user base. Readers can think of 𝑃1 as the Ethereum blockchainwhich
has seen the widest adoption amongst users and developers. 𝑃2 and
𝑃3 are two newer, alternative layer-1 blockchains that compete with
Ethereum. 𝑃2 is EVM-compatible (e.g. Binance Smart Chain), and
𝑃3 is not (e.g. Algorand).
Firms. Firms 𝐴 and 𝐵 build similar applications on blockchain,
such as a decentralized exchange (DEX) or a lending service. We
assume that the product offered by the firms are inter-operable,
meaning that if they are built on the same blockchain, they both
benefit from the network effect of each other’s users. An example
of this would be DEXes on the same chain: with the rise of DEX
aggregators, the liquidity found on multiple DEXes on the same
blockchain can often be atomically accessed by users at the same
time. This would not be true if they were built on two different
blockchains. We assume that firm 𝐴 is already built on the largest
blockchain 𝑃1 at the start of the game. Firm 𝐵 is a new entrant who
will choose a blockchain to launch its application in period 𝑡 = 0.
The game will then proceed as a two-stage Bertrand competition,
where in each of the two periods 𝑡 = 1, 2, the two firms set prices for
their services, denoted as 𝑝𝐴𝑡 , 𝑝𝐵𝑡 respectively, to maximize their
aggregate payoff. We assume that their discount factor is equal to 1
and that the marginal cost of production for both firms is 0.
Blockchain users. There is a continuum of users indexed by 𝑥 on
the unit interval [0, 1] according to increase personal preference for
firm B. All users can gain a benefit of 𝑘 > 0 from using the service
offered by either firm. Users choose their platform myopically in
each period to maximize their payoff. We denote the endogenously
determined number of users who choose firms A and B in period
𝑡, 𝑡 = 1, 2, as 𝑛𝐴𝑡 , 𝑛𝐵𝑡 respectively. The one-period payoff of a user
of type 𝑥 in period 𝑡, 𝑡 = 1, 2, is given by:
𝑈𝑡 (𝑥) =
𝛼 (𝑁1 + 𝑛𝐴𝑡 + 𝑛𝐵𝑡 ) − 𝑝𝐴𝑡 − 𝑠𝑥 + 𝑘, chooses A, A and B on 𝑃1
𝛼 (𝑁1 + 𝑛𝐴𝑡 + 𝑛𝐵𝑡 ) − 𝑝𝐵𝑡 − 𝑠 (1 − 𝑥) + 𝑘, chooses B, A and B on 𝑃1
𝛼 (𝑁1 + 𝑛𝐴𝑡 ) − 𝑝𝐴𝑡 − 𝑠𝑥 + 𝑘, chooses A, B on 𝑃𝑖 , 𝑖 ≠ 1
𝛼 (𝑁𝑖 + 𝑛𝐵𝑡 ) − 𝑝𝐵𝑡 − 𝑠 (1 − 𝑥) + 𝑘, chooses B, B on 𝑃𝑖 , 𝑖 ≠ 1
0, chooses neither .
(1)
The parameter 𝛼 measures the network effect, and the parameter
𝑠 > 0 measures the degree of dispersion of consumers’ preferences.
As can be seen from users’ payoffs, with prices held constant, users

benefit the most from the network effect when the two firms are
built on the same blockchain.
We impose the following technical assumption to avoid several
trivial corner cases, including the case where network effects are
so strong (𝛼 is too large) that only one firm would have users in
equilibrium, and the case where the benefit of users from using
products is so low (𝑘 is too low) that most users will drop out of
the blockchain platforms.
Assumption 1. The following relationships hold:
(1) 𝑠 > 𝛼 (2𝑁1 + 1)
(2) 𝑘 > 4𝑠 + 4𝛼 (1 + 𝑁1 + 𝑁2)
Blockchain incompatibility and user stickiness. If a user adopts
a product in the first period, then we assume that he faces an
additional switching cost if he wishes to use a different product
in the second period. We assume that this switching cost is zero
if both firms are built on an EVM-compatible blockchain. More
specifically, if firm B chooses to build on either 𝑃1 or 𝑃2, users will
have a switching cost of 0 in the second period. However, if the two
firms are built on two incompatible blockchains (i.e. B is built on
𝑃3), then users face a non-zero switching cost in the second period.
For simplicity, we assume that the switching cost is +∞ in this
case. This creates “stickiness” amongst the adopters of each firm.
Intuitively, firms A and B may take advantage of user stickiness in
the second period to extract as much rent as possible.
Timeline. The timeline of the model is given as below:
• Period 0: Firm B picks a blockchain to offer its product on.
• Period 1: Firms A and B set prices for their products, and
users then make their purchase decision.
• Period 2: Firms A and B may adjust the prices for their prod-
ucts, and users then make their purchase decision.
Definition 1 (Eqilibrium). An equilibrium consists of
(1) Firm B’s platform adoption strategy in period 0 and pricing
strategy in periods 1 and 2, 𝑑𝐵 = (𝑎, 𝑝𝐵1, 𝑝𝐵2), and
(2) firm A’s pricing strategy in periods 1 and 2 𝑑𝐴 = (𝑝𝐴1, 𝑝𝐴2).
We say that (𝑑𝐴, 𝑑𝐵) is an equilibrium if it constitutes a subgame
perfect Nash equilibrium.
3 EQUILIBRIUM ANALYSIS AND
IMPLICATIONS
In this section, we will first focus on the subgame in period 1 and
2, and examine the equilibrium behavior of both the users and the
firms under different compatibility settings. Using this, we will
derive B’s platform adoption decision in period 0. After that, we ex-
tend our model to discuss how blockchain platforms can incentivize
firms, especially new entrants, to adopt their blockchains
3.1 Compatible blockchains
Suppose firm B also adopts an EVM-compatible blockchain, i.e.
either 𝑃1 or 𝑃2. Recall that switching cost is assumed to be zero in
this case. As such, users’ decisions in period 2 do not depend on
their decisions in period 1. From the point of view of firms A and
B, they are playing an identical game of Bertrand competition in
each of the two periods. If there exists a unique Nash equilibrium
for the one-stage Bertrand competition, denoted as (𝑝𝐴, 𝑝𝐵), then
there exists a unique subgame perfect equilibrium where in each
period, firms A and B set the prices as (𝑝𝐴, 𝑝𝐵).
We will analyze the case when B chooses 𝑃1 vs 𝑃2 separately,
and solve for the equilibrium prices and payoffs in both cases.
Same blockchain. Because two firms are built on the same blockchain,
the positive network effects for the two firms are identical, so the
adoption decision of users are only based on the prices and their
individual preferences. Consider the user 𝑥𝑆 who is indifferent
between the two firms:
𝛼 (𝑁1+𝑛𝐴𝑡+𝑛𝐵𝑡 )−𝑝𝐴𝑡−𝑠𝑥𝑆+𝑘 = 𝛼 (𝑁1+𝑛𝐴𝑡+𝑛𝐵𝑡 )−𝑝𝐵𝑡−𝑠 (1−𝑥𝑆 )+𝑘.
Solving the above equation for 𝑥𝑆 gives us:
𝑥𝑆 =
1
2
+ 𝑝𝐵𝑡 − 𝑝𝐴𝑡
2𝑠
.
If the marginal user 𝑥𝑆 has non-negative surplus, then all users with
type 𝑥 < 𝑥𝑆 would choose 𝐴 and all others will choose 𝐵. Suppose
this is true for now, we now consider the Bertrand competition
between two firms. Firms maximize their one-stage profits:
𝜋𝐴𝑡 = 𝑝𝐴𝑡𝑥
𝑆 = 𝑝𝐴𝑡 (
1
2
+ 𝑝𝐵𝑡 − 𝑝𝐴𝑡
2𝑠
)
𝜋𝐵𝑡 = 𝑝𝐵𝑡 (1 − 𝑥𝑆 ) = 𝑝𝐵𝑡 (
1
2
+ 𝑝𝐴𝑡 − 𝑝𝐵𝑡
2𝑠
)
This will give us a system of first order conditions which we can
solve to pin down the equilibrium prices:
𝑝𝑆𝐴𝑡 = 𝑝𝑆𝐵𝑡 = 𝑠 (2)
It is easy to verify that all users have non-negative payoff when the
prices are set at (𝑝𝑆
𝐴𝑡
, 𝑝𝑆
𝐵𝑡
). Therefore the firms one-period payoffs
at equilibriumwhen they are built on the same blockchain are given
by
𝜋𝑆𝐴𝑡 = 𝜋𝑆𝐵𝑡 =
𝑠
2
. (3)
The total profits of the firms over two periods are then
𝜋𝑆𝐴 B 𝜋𝑆𝐴1 + 𝜋𝑆𝐴2 = 𝜋𝑆𝐵 B 𝜋𝑆𝐵1 + 𝜋𝑆𝐵2 = 𝑠 . (4)
Compatible but different blockchains. Recall that this is when firm
𝐴 is built on 𝑃1 and firm 𝐵 is built on 𝑃2. Unlike the previous case,
firms A and B no longer share the same platform, nor do they share
the same positive network effect. Instead, they have to maintain the
network effects through attracting enough users to their platforms.
We again first solve for user who is indifferent between the two
platforms:
𝛼 (𝑁1 + 𝑛𝐴𝑡 ) − 𝑝𝐴𝑡 − 𝑠𝑥𝐶 + 𝑘 = 𝛼 (𝑁2 + 𝑛𝐵𝑡 ) − 𝑝𝐵𝑡 − 𝑠 (1 − 𝑥𝐶 ) + 𝑘,
Again, if the marginal user 𝑥𝐶 has non-negative payoff, then every-
one with type 𝑥 < 𝑥𝐶 would adopt firm A and everyone else would
adopt firm 𝐵. This means that 𝑛𝐴𝑡 = 𝑥𝐶 , 𝑛𝐵𝑡 = 1 − 𝑥𝐶 . Solving for
𝑥𝐶 gives us
𝑥𝐶 =
𝛼𝑁1 − 𝛼𝑁2 + (𝑠 − 𝛼) − 𝑝𝐴𝑡 + 𝑝𝐵𝑡
2(𝑠 − 𝛼) . (5)
Note that the expression depends not only on prices but also on
the existing user bases. In particular, the larger the existing network
effect there is on a firm’s blockchain, the more customers that firm
is able to capture. Following the same procedure as in the previous

case, we can solve for the equilibrium prices of firms as well as
their equilibrium payoffs:
𝑝𝐶𝐴𝑡 = 𝑠 − 𝛼 + 𝛼 (𝑁1 − 𝑁2)
3
, 𝑝𝐶𝐵𝑡 = 𝑠 − 𝛼 + 𝛼 (𝑁2 − 𝑁1)
3
(6)
𝜋𝐶𝐴𝑡 =
(3𝑠 − 3𝛼 + 𝛼 (𝑁1 − 𝑁2))2
18(𝑠 − 𝛼) , 𝜋𝐶𝐵𝑡 =
(3𝑠 − 3𝛼 + 𝛼 (𝑁2 − 𝑁1))2
18(𝑠 − 𝛼)
(7)
It is also easy to verify that all users have positive payoff when
the prices are set at (𝑝𝐶
𝐴𝑡
, 𝑝𝐶
𝐵𝑡
). The total profits over the two periods
are simply twice the above amount:
𝜋𝐶𝐴 =
(3𝑠 − 3𝛼 + 𝛼 (𝑁1 − 𝑁2))2
9(𝑠 − 𝛼) , 𝜋𝐶𝐵 =
(3𝑠 − 3𝛼 + 𝛼 (𝑁2 − 𝑁1))2
9(𝑠 − 𝛼)
(8)
The following proposition summarizes the equilibrium results
when firms choose compatible blockchains:
Proposition 1. Suppose firmB chooses an EVM-compatible blockchains
(i.e. either 𝑃1 or 𝑃2). The following holds in equilibrium for the sub-
game starting in period 1:
(1) (Same Chain) If firm B chooses 𝑃1 in period 0, then the prices
set by firms A and B are 𝑝𝑆
𝐴𝑡
= 𝑝𝑆
𝐵𝑡
= 𝑠 ,for both 𝑡 = 1, 2. Their
aggregate payoffs are 𝜋𝑆
𝐴
= 𝜋𝑆
𝐵
= 𝑠 . Users with 𝑥 < 1

choose
platform A, and the rest choose platform B.
(2) (Different Chain) If firm B chooses 𝑃2 in period 0, then the
prices set by firms A and B are 𝑝𝐶
𝐴𝑡
= 𝑠 − 𝛼 + 𝛼 (𝑁1−𝑁2)
3
, 𝑝𝐶
𝐵𝑡
=
𝑠 −𝛼 + 𝛼 (𝑁2−𝑁1)

for both 𝑡 = 1, 2,. Their aggregate payoffs are
𝜋𝐶
𝐴
=
(3𝑠−3𝛼+𝛼 (𝑁1−𝑁2))2
9(𝑠−𝛼) , 𝜋𝐶
𝐵
=
(3𝑠−3𝛼+𝛼 (𝑁2−𝑁1))2
9(𝑠−𝛼) . Users
with 𝑥 <
3𝑠−3𝛼+𝛼 (𝑁1−𝑁2)
6(𝑠−𝛼) choose platform A, and the rest
choose platform B.
Implications of Proposition 1. When firms are built on the same
blockchain, users see no difference between the two firms, and the
two firms offer the same price and capture the same fraction of
the market. When firms are built on two compatible blockchains
however, the firm with bigger network effect is at a significant
advantage: not only does A capture more of the new market, it is
also able to charge more per customer. The following corollary is
an immediate consequence from comparing the payoff of firms:
Corollary 2. The following results hold:
(1) 𝜋𝐶
𝐵
< 𝜋𝐶
𝐴
, i.e., the payoff of firm B is lower than the payoff
of firm A when they choose different blockchains. The gap of
payoffs |𝜋𝐶
𝐵
− 𝜋𝐶
𝐴
| increases in 𝛼 .
(2) 𝜋𝐶
𝐵
< 𝜋𝑆
𝐵
, i.e., the payoff of firm B is lower when choosing
different blockchain relative to the case when choosing the
same blockchain as firm A. Moreover, 𝑝𝐶
𝐵𝑡
< 𝑝𝑆
𝐵𝑡
.
(3) If the difference between existing user bases of two blockchains
is small, i.e., 𝑁1 − 𝑁2 ≤ 3, then 𝜋𝐶
𝐴
< 𝜋𝑆
𝐴
, 𝑝𝐶
𝐴𝑡
< 𝑝𝑆
𝐴𝑡
, that
is, the payoff of firm A and the prices set by firm A are lower
when firms choose different blockchain, relative to the case
when both firms are on the same blockchain.
Implications of Corollary 2. (1) The first result is intuitive. To
compensate for its’ smaller existing user base, firm B needs to set a
lower price, relative to firm A, to attract users. As a result, its profit
is also lower than that of firm A in equilibrium. In particular, the
stronger the network effect (i.e., 𝛼), the larger the price gap and
profit gap are. (2) Firm B’s profit is lower when the B builds on
𝑃2 instead of 𝑃1. The reasons are two-folds. First, since 𝑁2 < 𝑁1,
firm B starts with a smaller existing user base relative to firm A.
Second, by building on a different chain, firm B no longer shares
the network effects from the users of firm A. This means that firm
B has to deploy a more aggressive pricing strategy (which means
lower price) to attract users. (3) When the gap between existing
user bases are not too big, relative to the case where firms are on the
same blockchain, firm A and B need to compete more aggressively
when they build on different blockchains. This erodes the profit of
firm A because A now needs to charge a low price.
3.2 Incompatible blockchains
We now switch our attention to the case when firm B offers its
product on the EVM-incompatible blockchain 𝑃3. In this case, both
firmswill have high user stickiness in period 2 due to high switching
costs between incompatible blockchains. Intuitively, this will allows
the firms to avoid price competition and extract more surplus from
users.
To analyze this formally, we first derive the equilibrium behavior
of firms and users in period 2. Since we assume that switching cost
is +∞ when chains are incompatible, users cannot switch firms.
Suppose user 𝑥 chooses firm A in the first period, his best strategy
in the second period is to stay with firm A if the price 𝑝𝐴2 is low
enough for him have non-negative payoff: 𝛼 (𝑁1 +𝑛𝐴2) −𝑝𝐴2 −𝑠𝑥 +
𝑘 ≥ 0. Otherwise, he buys nothing. We can then write the demand
function for firm A as follows:
𝑛𝐴2 =
{
min{𝑘+𝛼𝑁1−𝑝𝐴2
𝑠−𝑎 , 𝑛𝐴1}, if 𝑘 ≥ 𝑝𝐴2 − 𝛼𝑁1
0, otherwise.
Given 𝑛𝐴1, firm 𝐴 wants to maximize 𝑝𝐴2𝑛𝐴2 in period 2. Recall
𝑘 > 4𝑠 + 4𝛼 (1 + 𝑁1 + 𝑁2) from Assumption 1. One can check that
the equilibrium price and adoption are given by
𝑝∗𝐴2 = 𝑘 + 𝛼𝑁1 + (𝛼 − 𝑠)𝑛𝐴1 (9)
𝑛∗𝐴2 = 𝑛𝐴1 (10)
That is, firmAwould offer the maximum price such that all adopters
of A from the first period would weakly prefer to stay with firm A
than leaving the system. We can use the same steps to show that
given 𝑛𝐵1, the optimal price and adoption for firm B in period 2 are
given by
𝑝∗𝐵2 = 𝑘 + 𝛼𝑁2 + (𝛼 − 𝑠)𝑛𝐵1 (11)
𝑛∗𝐵2 = 𝑛𝐵1 (12)
Given the equilibrium behavior of the users and the firms in the
second period, we can now derive how firms would price their
products in the first period. Since users are myopic, we can use the
same procedure as in Section 3.1 to derive that, for a given 𝑝𝐴1, 𝑝𝐵1,
the market shares for 𝐴 and 𝐵 at equilibrium are:
𝑛𝐴1 = 𝑥 𝐼 (13)
𝑛𝐵1 = 1 − 𝑥 𝐼 (14)
𝑥 𝐼 =
𝛼𝑁1 − 𝛼𝑁2 + (𝑠 − 𝛼) − 𝑝𝐴1 + 𝑝𝐵1
2(𝑠 − 𝛼) (15)
 
26
To EVM or Not to EVM: Blockchain Compatibility and Network Effects DeFi ’22, November 11, 2022, Los Angeles, CA, USA
where all users with type 𝑥 < 𝑥 𝐼 would adopt 𝐴 and everyone else
would adopt 𝐵. Now, when setting the price in period 1, both firms
try to maximize their aggregate payoffs:
𝜋𝐴 = 𝑝𝐴1𝑛𝐴1 + 𝑝∗𝐴2𝑛
∗
𝐴2 (16)
𝜋𝐵 = 𝑝𝐵1𝑛𝐵1 + 𝑝∗𝐵2𝑛
∗
𝐵2 (17)
Plugging (9)-(15) into the above equations, we can solve the re-
sulting system of first order conditions for 𝜋𝐴, 𝜋𝐵 to derive the
equilibrium prices that the firms offer in the first period:
𝑝∗𝐴1 =
(10(𝑠 − 𝛼) − 5𝑘 − 𝛼 (𝑁1 + 4𝑁2))
5
(18)
𝑝∗𝐵1 =
(10(𝑠 − 𝛼) − 5𝑘 − 𝛼 (4𝑁1 + 𝑁2))
5
(19)
We can verify that all users have positive in period 1 payoff when
the prices are set at (𝑝∗
𝐴1
, 𝑝∗
𝐵1
). The equilibrium total profits of firms
are:
𝜋∗𝐴 =
3(5(𝑠 − 𝛼) + 2𝛼 (𝑁1 − 𝑁2))2
100(𝑠 − 𝛼) (20)
𝜋∗𝐵 =
3(5(𝑠 − 𝛼) + 2𝛼 (𝑁2 − 𝑁1))2
100(𝑠 − 𝛼) (21)
The following proposition characterize the equilibrium results
when firm B adopts an incompatible blockchain:
Proposition 3. Suppose that firm B adopts platform 𝑃3 in period
0. In the subgame that starts in period 1, the following holds:
(1) In both periods, users with type 𝑥 <
5(𝑠−𝛼)+2𝛼 (𝑁1−𝑁2)
10(𝑠−𝛼) chooses
firm A, and the rest chooses firm B.
(2) The prices set by firms A and B in period 1 are
𝑝∗𝐴1 =
10(𝑠 − 𝛼) − 5𝑘 − 𝛼 (𝑁1 + 4𝑁2)
5

100(𝑠 − 𝛼) .
Implications of Proposition 3. We can see that the equilibrium
price of firm 𝑖 ∈ {𝐴, 𝐵} in period 1 is decreasing in users’ stand-
alone value for the product, 𝑘 , as well as the existing user base
on its blockchain 𝑁𝑖 . This might seem counter intuitive, as bigger
user base correspond to higher price in the compatible case. The
relationship here is reversed due to the fact that the higher the 𝑘 and
𝑁𝑖 , the more the firms can extract from users in period 2. As a result,
firms are willing lower their prices in period 1 to attract users. We
can also see that when users’ willingness to pay is sufficiently large
in period 2 (𝑘, 𝑁𝑖 are sufficiently large), the firms are even willing
to offer negative prices in the first period! This can be realized
in the form of subsidized trading fees, and other liquidity mining
incentives. Moreover, the expressions of aggregate payoffs do not
contain 𝑘 . This is because all the surplus extracted from users in
period 2 are competed away in period 1 in the Bertrand competition.
We are now ready to compare the payoffs of firms in the two
cases and characterize the full equilibrium. The following results
can be inferred immediately by comparing 𝜋∗
𝐵
with 𝜋𝐶
𝐵
, 𝜋𝑆
𝐵
and
comparing 𝜋∗
𝐴
with 𝜋𝐶
𝐴
.
Theorem 4. The following results hold:
(1) 𝜋∗
𝐵
< 𝜋𝐶
𝐵
, 𝜋∗
𝐴
< 𝜋𝐶
𝐴
, that is, the payoffs of both A and B firms
are lower when firm B chooses 𝑃3 relative to the case where
firm B chooses 𝑃2
(2) In equilibrium, firm B chooses blockchain 𝑃1 in period 0.
Implications of Theorem 4. (1) The equilibrium payoffs of both
firms in the incompatible case are lower comparedwith their payoffs
in the different but compatible blockchains case. When blockchains
are incompatible, users switching cost allows both firms to attract
rent from users in period 2. As a result, the competition between
the firms to attract users in period 1 is more intense, and they need
to adopt very aggressive pricing strategies, which lead to a lower
overall payoff for both firms. (2) Since 𝜋𝑆
𝐵
> 𝜋𝐶
𝐵
> 𝜋∗
𝐵
, all else
being equal, the new entrant firm B would prefer to build on 𝑃1.
Intuitively, this is due to the fact that when firms build on the same
blockchain, they share the network effect, and thus do not need to
compete as fiercely for market share. When firms adopt different
but compatible blockchains, they need to compete more fiercely for
market shares because there is no shared mutual benefits between
the firms. When they adopt different and incompatible blockchains,
the need to compete for market share is even stronger (in the first
period). This is because firms are essentially monopolies over their
adopters in the second period, and so they have strong incentive to
capture as much of the market in the first period as possible.
3.3 How to attract firm adoption
In the previous section, we established that all else being equal
(security, scalability, time to finality, etc), the new entrant firm B
will be likely to build on the most popular platform 𝑃1 on which
firm A is also built. Viewed from the perspective of a blockchain
platforms, our results suggest that alternative layer-1’s that have not
captured as much adopters as Ethereumwill need to offer additional
incentives for developers to build on their platform.
There are two natural ways for blockchain platforms 𝑃2, 𝑃3 to
attract the adoption of new entrants: (1) directly subsidizing the
new entrant firm, (2) improving user experience (e.g., providing
higher throughput and thus lower transaction fees, and providing
faster settlement time). In this section, we will extend our model
and analyze both options.
Directly subsidizing new firms . Subsidizing developers is a com-
mon tactic observed empirically: many alternative layer-1’s have
significant ecosystem funds for supporting developers
12
. In con-
trast, Ethereum blockchain currently provides less direct subsidiza-
tion to developers. To understand the effect of subsidization more
formally, we extend our baseline model to allow blockchain plat-
forms 𝑃2, 𝑃3 to subsidize new firms by offering a one time payment
of 𝑐 if the firm builds on their platform.

Proposition 5. The following results hold:
(1) If only blockchain platform 𝑃2 offers a subsidy, then in equilib-
rium, firm B chooses 𝑃2 when the subsidy is sufficiently large.
𝑐 > 𝑐∗
2
= 𝜋𝑆
𝐵
− 𝜋𝐶
𝐵
(2) If only blockchain platform 𝑃3 offers a subsidy, then in equilib-
rium, firm B chooses 𝑃3 when the subsidy is sufficiently large.
𝑐 > 𝑐∗
3
= 𝜋𝑆
𝐵
− 𝜋∗
𝐵
. Moreover, 𝑐∗
3
> 𝑐∗
2
.
Sufficiently large subsidy induces new entrant to adopt 𝑃2 or 𝑃3.
Since 𝜋∗
𝐵
< 𝜋𝐶
𝐵
, it is more costly for EVM-incompatible blockchains
to attract adoption because of more intense competition.
If both 𝑃2 and 𝑃3 can offer subsidies, and 𝑐1 and 𝑐2 are their
subsidy amount respectively, then firm B would want to choose 𝑃2
if and only if
𝜋𝐶𝐵 + 𝑐2 ≥ max{𝜋𝑆𝐵, 𝜋
∗
𝐵 + 𝑐3}. (22)
On the other hand, 𝐵 would want to choose 𝑃3 if and only if
𝜋∗𝐵 + 𝑐3 ≥ max{𝜋𝑆𝐵, 𝜋
𝐶
𝐵 + 𝑐2}. (23)
Since the firm’s decision depends on both 𝑐2 and 𝑐3, 𝑃2 and 𝑃3
have to strategically set their subsidization policies in order attract
the firm. However, we will not be providing a formal equilibrium
analysis for the subsidy strategy in this paper.
Improving user experience. Platforms can also attract adoption by
improving users’ stand-alone value of the product (𝑘 in our model).
Note that the user’s experience with a product is a function of both
the product itself, as well as the blockchain that the product is
built upon. This means that if a blockchain is fundamentally better,
users are more likely to pick products that are built on the better
blockchain. This would increase the payoffs of the firms built on
the better blockchain. As mentioned before, such improvement
take different forms, including: faster finality time, more secure
transactions, and lower gas fees. We extend our model to include an
additional factor 𝑑 , which represents the extra utility that the user
gets from using platform 𝑃2 (or 𝑃3). Using the same procedure as in
our baseline model, we can arrive at the following characterization
of the equilibrium results:
Proposition 6. Suppose that users earn an additional benefit 𝑑
from using platform 𝑃2. Firm B will choose 𝑃2 if 𝑑 > 𝑑∗
2
= 3(𝑠 −
1)
(√︃
𝑠
𝑠−𝛼 − 1
)
+ 𝑁1 − 𝑁2. In such a case, the equilibrium prices in
period 1 and 2 are
𝑝𝐶𝐴𝑡 = 𝑠−𝛼+𝛼 (𝑁1 − 𝑁2) − 𝑑
3
, 𝑝𝐶𝐵𝑡 = 𝑠−𝛼+𝛼 (𝑁2 − 𝑁1) + 𝑑
3
, 𝑡 = 1, 2.
Their aggregate payoffs are
𝜋𝐶𝐴 =
(3𝑠 − 3𝛼 − 𝑑 + 𝛼 (𝑁1 − 𝑁2))2
9(𝑠 − 𝛼) , 𝜋𝐶𝐵 =
(3𝑠 − 3𝛼 + 𝑑 + 𝛼 (𝑁2 − 𝑁1))2
9(𝑠 − 𝛼) .
Users with type 𝑥 < 𝑥𝐶 =
−𝑑+3𝑠−3𝛼+𝛼 (𝑁1−𝑁2)
6(𝑠−𝛼) would choose firm A,
and the rest choose firm B.
Implication of Proposition 6. When blockchain 𝑃2 is significantly
better than blockchain 𝑃1 (𝑑 is sufficiently large) , the new entrant
will use blockchain 𝑃2. This is because with higher extra benefit 𝑑 ,
more users will choose platform 𝑃2, which makes building on 𝑃2
more profitable for the firm. The large the 𝑑 , the higher the price
𝑝𝐶
𝐵𝑡
firm B can charge to users on platform 𝑃2, and the higher the
payoff of firm B from building on platform 𝑃2. This result implies
that EVM-compatible blockchains with much lower transaction
costs and faster settlement time may have a chance to out-compete
the incumbent Ethereum blockchain. In the following Proposition,
we state the analogous result for the non EVM-compatible chain:
Proposition 7. Suppose that users earn an additional benefit
𝑑 from using platform 𝑃3. Firm B chooses 𝑃3 if 𝑑 > 𝑑∗
3
= (𝑠 −
𝛼)
(√︃
𝑠
𝑠−𝛼 − 5
2
)
+ 𝑁1 − 𝑁2 . The equilibrium prices in period 1 are
𝑝∗𝐴1 =
−4𝑑 + (10(𝑠 − 𝛼) − 5𝑘 − 𝛼 (𝑁1 + 4𝑁2))
5
,
𝑝∗𝐵1 =
−𝑑 + (10(𝑠 − 𝛼) − 5𝑘 − 𝛼 (4𝑁1 + 𝑁2))
5
,
and the equilibrium price in period 2 are:
𝑝∗𝐴2 = 𝑘+ 𝛼 − 𝑠
2
+ 4
5
𝑁1+
1
5
𝑁2+
𝑑
5
, 𝑝∗𝐵2 = 𝑘+ 𝛼 − 𝑠
2
+ 4
5
𝑁2+

5
𝑁1+
4𝑑

.
The equilibrium payoffs of firms A and B are:
𝜋∗𝐴 =
3(−2𝑑 + 5(𝑠 − 𝛼) + 2𝛼 (𝑁1 − 𝑁2))2
100(𝑠 − 𝛼) ,
𝜋∗𝐵 =
3(2𝑑 + 5(𝑠 − 𝛼) + 2𝛼 (𝑁2 − 𝑁1))2
100(𝑠 − 𝛼) .
In both periods, users with type 𝑥 < 𝑥 𝐼 =
5(𝑠−𝛼)+2𝛼 (𝑁1−𝑁2)−2𝑑
10(𝑠−𝛼)
would choose firm A, and the rest would choose firm B.
Implication of Proposition 7. EVM-incompatible blockchains with
better user experience can also attract new entrant firm. More-
over, one unit increase in 𝑑 increases users adoption (1 − 𝑋 𝐼
) by
1
5
.
Comparing this with the case for EVM-compatible blockchain in
Proposition 6, we see that this number is lower at
1
6
. This suggests
that it is comparativelymore effective for incompatible blockchains
to attract users and developers via offering a fundamentally better
blockchain.
Enlarge existing user bases and network effects. Another way
that platforms can make themselves more attractive to users/firms
is through acquiring bigger user bases and thus larger positive
network effect (i.e. 𝑁2 or 𝑁3). Mathematically, this has the same
effect as improving user experience, since increasing 𝑁2 or 𝑁3 is
equivalent to increasing the benefit of users on that blockchain, 𝑘 .
Therefore we can draw the same conclusions as above for firms’
ability to attract users per unit increase of existing network effect.
4 CONCLUSION
Our analysis shows that, absent of external incentives, developers
tend to “tip” to one dominant chain due to the network effect. Our
analysis also highlights interesting strategic differences between
EVM-compatible and incompatible blockchains. Compared to in-
compatible alternative layer-1’s, compatible layer-1’s can attract
firms from the dominant blockchain with less direct subsidy. On
the other hand, for every unit increase in the “quality” or the ex-
isting user base of blockchain, incompatible chains gain more user
adoption. One key dynamic that we do not capture in our model
is negative network effect (i.e. congestion). We leave it to future
work for incorporating negative network effect to better predict
adoption patterns between different blockchains.
