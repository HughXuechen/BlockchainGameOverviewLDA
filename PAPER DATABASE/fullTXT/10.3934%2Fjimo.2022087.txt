Abstract. This paper considers a supply chain that includes one supplier and
one retailer, in which the retailer has a more accurate demand forecast. The
blockchain technology can verify the authenticity of the information, then the
retailer can choose to truly share the demand information with the supplier
by adopting such a costly technology. We discuss three scenarios based on
signaling game: the retailer bears all the cost (no subsidy), the supplier bears
part of the cost by providing direct subsidy or wholesale discount, respectively.
Specifically, in a demand information asymmetric setting, we mainly focus on
exploring the conditions of retailer adopting blockchain technology and the sup-
plier’s subsidy strategy choice, and further verify the robustness of the model
by considering the retailer’s risk aversion or multiple suppliers. In all scenar-
ios, we find that the retailer will apply threshold strategy to adopt blockchain
technology. The retailer’s willingness to adopt blockchain technology is neg-
atively correlated with the corresponding adoption cost, the supplier’s profit
level, and positively correlated with the number of suppliers. Additionally, we
find the supplier can profit from providing subsidies when the cost of adopting
blockchain technology is around a medium level, and the direct subsidy is su-
perior to wholesale discount. More surprisingly, we find subsidies may work to
the disadvantage of the subsidized party. Specifically, compared to no subsidy,
we find the direct subsidy and the wholesale discount can increase the retailer’s
willingness to adopt blockchain technology, but hurt the retailer’s as well as
the supply chain’s profits.

1. Introduction. Demand information asymmetry in supply chain mainly refers
that downstream retailer (She) is more accurate in predicting market demand than
upstream supplier (He). In practice, in a retail channel which consists of one up-
stream supplier and one downstream retailer, the retailer is often closer to consumers
and has more expertise and superior forecasting abilities in the selling process [24].
Therefore, the retailer usually holds a better knowledge about the market demand
than the supplier, which is a widespread assumption in the operation management
literatures [36, 1, 37]. The demand information asymmetry between the supplier
and the retailer can cause a serious bullwhip effect and hurt the expected profit
of supply chain [23, 34]. The supplier can only determine the component capac-
ity based on the purchase quantity in the previous periods due to the inaccurate
forecasts. For example, Hynix Semiconductor Inc., even had to sell the remaining
products at a price lower than their manufacturing cost due to oversupply [47].
Hence, for the supplier, there is a risk of loss caused by insufficient inventory or ex-
cessive inventory. While for the retailer, she also faces the loss of shortages caused
by the insufficient inventory of the supplier. However, since it’s always beneficial for
the retailer to exaggerate her private forecast information, the supplier may ignore
the information provided by the retailer or reduce it. [9] discussed this process in
detail and empirically showed that over time, the component capacity set by the
supplier is on average 30% less than the private forecast information the retailer
shares. Therefore, it’s risky for both the supplier and the retailer to make decisions.
Most scholars have established effective contracts through signaling and screening,
such as wholesale price contract, repurchase contract, agreement contract. But
many contracts of them are complicated and difficult to operate [8, 19].
The development of blockchain technology provides a new approach to solve
the problem of mistrust between enterprises [32]. Technically, blockchain technol-
ogy is a decentralized and distributed database where information can be securely
recorded. Blockchain is cryptographically secure, distributed ledgers that can en-
able decentralized verifiability of digital-goods transactions. The advantages of the
technology are well known as they relate to storing records of digital transactions
including strong security, disintermediation, record integrity, automation [6].
For example, Alabama’s Auburn University successfully completed a pilot in
partnership with Nike, Macy’s and Kohl’s using Hyperledger to upload supply chain
data onto the blockchain[14]. [45] designed and evaluated a blockchain technology
architecture for sharing demand data in the supply chain to reduce bullwhip effect.
The general process can be described as follows. The retailer adopts blockchain
technology and uploads the relevant data of forecasting demand to the blockchain
database. Because the data is encrypted in the design, the supplier needs to de-
crypt the data first, and then to access the data, which ensures the security of the
retailer’s data. When the retailer wants to share private demand information with
the supplier, she can share the key of the relevant data with the supplier first, and
then the supplier can access the data. The retailer will not arbitrarily tamper with
the blockchain database due to the huge fee of tampering, then the supplier can
verify the authenticity of the private demand information shared by the retailer.
At present, many large enterprises are working hard to invest in building blockchain
platforms for various complex application scenarios, such as IBM, Tencent and Al-
ibaba. The blockchain platform usually has developed by third party (such as
IBM), which also reduces the possibility of enterprises tampering with data by the
increased counterfeiting cost. For example, IBM’s Food Trust platform has become
RETAILER’S WILLINGNESS TO ADOPT BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY 3289
popular with consumers for its traceable information. Many suppliers (e.g., Dole
Food, Nestle, Tyson Foods, Unilever) and retailers (e.g., Carrefour, Walmart) in
food industry have joined IBM’s Food Trust platform, which is built based on the
blockchain technology. However, for such a new technology that currently had few
commercial applications [16], the costs are required to adopt blockchain technol-
ogy in different scenarios are also different [43, 10, 7]. Carrefour adds scale and
the pricing ranges from 100 a month to 10, 000 a month depending on size of the
enterprise[11]. Therefore, the retailer needs to weigh the benefits of exposing private
demand information and the cost of adopting blockchain technology, and maximize
her expected profit to make decisions.
Therefore, this paper aims to answer: (1) under what conditions the retailer
is willing to adopt blockchain technology, (2) what is the optimal subsidy for the
supplier and what is the reaction of the retailer to the supplier’s subsidy. With these
questions, we discuss the role of private demand information sharing in a two-echelon
supply chain when the blockchain technology is available. We find the supplier can
update his demand forecast regardless of that the retailer adopts it or not. The
main sequence of events is as follows, in the first stage, the retailer chooses whether
to adopt the blockchain technology. In the second stage, based on the retailer’s
adopting decision, the supplier may update the demand forecast information and
secure the component capacity. In the third stage, the random demand is realized
and the retailer’s order is constrained by the capacity. Referring to some cost-
sharing settings like [46, 40, 31, 12, 50], we consider three scenarios: the retailer
bears all the cost (Scenario A), the supplier provides a direct subsidy to bear part of
the cost (Scenario B) and the supplier holds a wholesale discount to bear part of the
cost (Scenario C). We further extend the previous model by considering the retailer’s
risk aversion or multiple suppliers. We find perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE)
in all scenarios, i.e., the retailer’s adopting decision is simplified to a threshold
strategy. That is, the retailer adopts the blockchain technology if and only if her
demand forecast information is larger than the threshold. Our findings can provide
theoretical and practical guidance for the supplier and retailer.
Specifically, from exploring the retailer’s strategy of adopting blockchain tech-
nology, we find that the probability of the retailer adopting blockchain technology
decreases as the cost of adopting blockchain technology or the supplier’s profit level
increase, but increases as the number of her suppliers increases. This reflects the re-
ality that a retailer with a larger market size, such as Walmart and Carrefour (who
can correspondingly afford higher adoption cost of blockchain technology, higher
negotiation power of price, and work with more suppliers), is more likely to in-
corporate blockchain technology. Since the development of blockchain technology
is still immature and the adoption cost is relatively high, only the large retailer
can profit from the adoption of blockchain technology to achieve true information
sharing. However, when adopting blockchain technology is costless, we find the re-
tailer is always willing to share her private demand information. This suggests that
with the rapid development of information technology, the cost of the blockchain
technology will be reduced significantly, then more and more retailers should adopt
blockchain technology to solve the information asymmetry problem.
We also explored the supplier’s subsidy strategy and its impact to the supply
chain. We find the supplier should provide a subsidy only when the cost of adopt-
ing blockchain technology is around a medium level. For the direct subsidy and
wholesale discount, our findings show that providing a direct subsidy outperforms
3290 ZHONGBAO ZHOU, XINGFEN LIU, FEIMIN ZHONG, YUAN CAO AND LONG ZHENG
a wholesale discount for the supplier. Hence, our finding suggests that these suppli-
ers who subsidize the retailer to adopt blockchain technology should provide direct
subsidy to gain more profit.
Additionally, an interesting finding is that, providing subsidies does not always fa-
vor the subsidized party. Specifically, the retailer is more willing to adopt blockchain
technology when there is a direct subsidy or a wholesale discount, but the profits
of the retailer and the supply chain system will decrease. That is, for the supplier,
providing a direct subsidy outperforms a wholesale discount, whereas the retailer
prefers no subsidy. This finding suggests that the supplier should seek to provide
subsidies to the retailer to increase profits.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we review the
literatures. In Section 3, we describe the model parameter setting and introduce
the benchmark model. In Section 4, we find the PBEs in the three scenarios,
respectively. In Section 5, three proposed scenarios are numerically simulated and
analyzed in detail. In Section 6, we extended the model by considering the retailer’s
risk aversion and multiple suppliers. The article is summarized in end of the article.
2. Literature review. This article relates two streams of research, demand infor-
mation asymmetry in supply chain and the model application of blockchain tech-
nology. We elaborate on them as follows.
2.1. Demand information asymmetry. Demand information asymmetry has
been a hot challenge in the supply chain, many scholars have proposed various sce-
narios to enable information sharing in supply chain. There is a lot of literatures
that are similar to our setting that the retailer has advantageous demand forecast
information, for example [37, 30, 27, 36, 25, 2]. The model most similar to our
paper is [37], they studied the important problem of how to assure credible fore-
cast information sharing between a supplier and a manufacturer by developing two
mechanisms, i.e., a nonlinear capacity reservation contract under which the manu-
facturer agrees to pay a fee to reserve capacity, and an advance purchase contract
under which the manufacturer is induced to place a firm order before the supplier
secures the component capacity used to build the end product. However, in our
article, blockchain technology can ensure a credible information sharing due to its
immutability and traceability, thus we focus on whether the retailer should adopt
blockchain technology, which is different with their study.
In addition, [28] adopted a screening game in the presence of the supplier en-
croachment, then the reseller signals private information through order quantity,
while in our paper, the action of “whether a retailer adopts blockchain technol-
ogy” affects the supplier’s prediction of private demand information. They also
used a screening game of nonlinear contract to screen the retailer’s private demand
information in [29]. Where a screening game mainly refer to that the supplier pro-
vides an optimized menu for the retailer to choose from, and through the retailer’s
choice, the supplier can have different beliefs about the private information. And
in a signaling game, the decision maker who holds a private information will move
at first. Such movement will reveal all or part of the private information to the
following decision makers. They are two common game-theoretic approaches to
resolve information asymmetry. Similar to our paper, [36] also analyzed a setting
in which a manufacturer and a retailer face uncertain demand, but the retailer has
an information advantage in the form of a private demand forecast. From such
RETAILER’S WILLINGNESS TO ADOPT BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY 3291
information asymmetry that causes the manufacturer to incur a hidden informa-
tion cost, they showed that a manufacturer can leverage his timing advantage to
strategically implement a temporary contract adjustment mechanism, which allows
him to counter his informational disadvantage and either eliminate or reduce the
hidden information cost.
There are also some other kinds of contracts that enable information to be shared
credibly under the prior agreement between the parties, such as typical commitment
penalty contract. This type of contract mainly through mutual punishment to
achieve the reliable sharing of private information. The problem in [13] is similar to
our paper, they proposed a set of commitment penalty contracts, then proved that
the supplier could obtain the private demand information of the retailer by provid-
ing promise-penalty contract constraints. They found an equilibrium to maximize
the expected profit, thus the retailer could truly disclose their private demand in-
formation. [15] also effectively realized the sharing of private demand information
through such a contract. This type of contract may enable the information sharing
truly through penalty constraints, but it is difficult to verify whether the informa-
tion is truly shared, and the contract operation is relatively complex. While in our
paper, the supplier can verify the authenticity of the predicted information through
the tamper-proof nature of blockchain technology.
In recent studies, some scholars have explored the scenario of demand informa-
tion asymmetry in some more realistic scenarios [41, 27, 25]. [41] assumed that in
the presence of retail competition, sharing information can ensure adequate capa-
bility level but bringing fierce competition. Hence, the retailer needs to trade-off
between the two effects of reliable information sharing. They found an incumbent
retailer who observes a high demand will profit from increased level of the sup-
plier’s component capacity, thus she is willing to share information truly. On the
other hand, when she observes a low demand, she is unwilling to trade high level of
component capacity, then she truthfully discloses her low forecasts to curb compe-
tition. In a scenario that similar to the extended part of our paper, [27] examined
a supply chain with two manufacturers in which each manufacturer implements
a cross-sales strategy by selling a substitutable product through two common re-
tailers. They found both manufacturers and retailers can benefit from a two-part
tariff contract if product package substitutability is more intensive and the demand
uncertainty level is relatively high, or if the product package competition is less
intense. In an e-commerce scenario that an offline showroom has advantageous
demand information, [25] considered a supply chain where an offline showroom pro-
vides experience service for an existing online retailer and intends to introduce a
new competing online retailer to satisfy consumers’ heterogeneous demand. They
examined the impact of competition and the offline showroom’s optimal channel
cooperation strategy under asymmetric information. Similar with us, they found
that optimal channel cooperation strategy depends on the trade-off between signal
cost, experience service level, and creates value. [26] studied the horizontal dual
source model between an integrated device manufacturer (IDM) and foundry in the
semiconductor industry, and they determined the unique separation equilibrium
through signaling in the case of information asymmetry. However, in their paper,
IDM may need to twist up his component capacity retention decision to obtain reli-
able information, which differs from our paper. [24] investigated the manufacturer’s
contract choice (drop-shipping or batch ordering) and retailer’s information sharing
strategy in the presence of product quality decision. they found the retailer prefers
3292 ZHONGBAO ZHOU, XINGFEN LIU, FEIMIN ZHONG, YUAN CAO AND LONG ZHENG
to share demand information when the quality investment efficiency is high under
batch ordering contract, while she always chooses to share information under drop-
shipping contract. These above articles and our paper aim to solve the problem
of demand asymmetry in the supply chain. But the difference is that our major
contribution is to explore under what conditions the retailer is willing to adopt the
blockchain technology based on her private demand and cost of adopting blockchain
technology. We find the supplier can update his demand forecast and earn more
profit even if the retailer finally does not adopt blockchain technology.
2.2. Model and applications of blockchain technology in the supply chain.
In recent years, the relevant research on the application of blockchain technology has
gradually increased [44]. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no article
that addressed the decision to adopt blockchain technology as a signal to solve the
information asymmetry problem as we do. Therefore, we will review articles that
explore blockchain technology in different applications by using a game-theoretic
approach.
Firstly, numerous studies have explored whether firm should adopt blockchain
technology. For example, [12] explored whether supply chain should adopt blockchain
technology based on considering consumer traceability awareness and the cost of
using blockchain technology. Their results show that the conditions for supply
chain adoption of blockchain technology are closely related to consumer aware-
ness of traceability, production costs, and the cost of using blockchain technology.
Moreover, under certain conditions, revenue sharing contract can achieve Pareto
improvements in supply chains when adopting blockchain technology. Their cost
assumptions for adopting blockchain technology are similar to our paper, and they
also consider cost sharing. The difference is that they do not consider the informa-
tion asymmetry problem but the impact of traceability on whether the supply chain
adopts blockchain technology or not. [5] examined the blockchain technology adop-
tion level for Newsvendor model and its impacts on the optimal ordering decisions
and the corresponding optimal profit. They found that an increased blockchain tech-
nology adoption level may reduce optimal ordering, and it is not always profitable
even though there is no cost of blockchain technology. Based on the assumption
that blockchain technology eliminates all risks in the supply chain and saves trans-
action cost, but also requires initial implementation investments and variable cost,
[10] explored the service strategies of supplier and the optimal order quantity and
sales price decisions of retailer. They found all cases in which the use of smart
contracts makes blockchain technology applications more operationally convenient
and economically appealing.
In addition, by considering the game between platforms based on blockchain
technology, [7] analyzed the Nash game of product information disclosure between
two rental service platforms and determined the conditions under which platforms
choose to disclose or not to disclose information. They assumed that the adoption of
blockchain technology can reduce the cost of information auditing, but they ignored
the operational cost of the blockchain technology itself. [48] built a multi-period
pricing model between a blockchain-technology-supported platform and a tradi-
tional platform under network effect. They found that platforms need to adopt the
blockchain technology antecedent to the competitors. However, they also did not
consider the cost of adopting blockchain technology. Some researches explored the
identification of product authenticity through blockchain technology. [42] exam-
ined the use of permissioned blockchain technology for retailer to help brand name
RETAILER’S WILLINGNESS TO ADOPT BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY 3293
companies combat imitators and how this would affect brand name companies (i.e.,
incumbents) in the supply chain. [39] also examined how blockchain technology
can be used by firms and government to combat counterfeiting. However, to our
best knowledge, no studies have yet to discuss whether a company is willing to
use blockchain technology to cooperate with other companies based on demand
information asymmetry. With the development of the blockchain technology, this
question is undoubtedly very meaningful.
3. Model settings and benchmarks. Considering a two-echelon supply chain
consisting of a supplier and a retailer, and both of them are risk-neutral. Before
the retailer places an order, the supplier must secure component capacity K at a
unit cost ck according to his prior information on demand D. Later, the retailer
observes the demand and then places an order. The supplier tries to meet the
order for unit product cost c under the capacity constraint, and then delivers the
products at unit wholesale price w to the retailer. Finally, during the selling season,
the retailer sells products to consumers at unit retail price r. We assume ck, c, r
are common knowledge and are exogenous parameters. We assume r > w > c+ ck,
otherwise, the product is unprofitable. Without loss of generality, we assume that
unmet demand will be lost without additional out-of-stock penalties, and unsold
inventory will have a residual value of zero.
In this paper, we assume the demand is composed of three parts: D = u +
ξ + ε [37]. In which u is common knowledge that represents the average market
demand. ξ is the retailer’s private demand information based on the historical data
on her private blockchain, which is a more accurate part in demand forecast and is
deterministically known by the retailer. On the contrary, the supplier only knows
that ξ is a zero-mean continuous random variable with probability density function
(PDF) f(.) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) F (.) supported on [−ξ̄, ξ̄]
(i.e., f(ξ) = 0 if ξ 6∈ [−ξ̄, ξ̄]). In particular, both parties learn the two parts u + ε,
where u is a positive number and ε is a zero-mean continuous random variable with
PDF g(.) and CDF G(.) supported on [−ε̄, ε̄] (i.e., g(ε) = 0 if ε 6∈ [−ε̄, ε̄]). We
assume that the retailer is willing to share her private demand to the supplier when
she adopts blockchain technology, otherwise she does not need to pay the cost of
adopting the blockchain that has described in the introduction, where the cost we
named as M in this paper. Then after observing the retailer’s choice, the supplier
can update his belief about the true private demand information ξ of the retailer,
i.e., the supplier can accurately know the retailer’s private demand information if the
retailer adopts the blockchain technology, whereas the supplier only can update the
demand distribution if the retailer does not adopt. In summary, the decision process
can be characterized as follows. In the first stage, the retailer decides whether to
adopt the blockchain technology based on her private demand information ξ. In
the second stage, the supplier builds his component capacity K after observing the
retailer’s choice. In the third stage, the retailer places her order D = u + ξ + ε
constrained by the component capacity K.
Before discussing the supplier’s and the retailer’s equilibriums, we first consider
two benchmarks that will be used to evaluate the supply chain’s expected profit:
the centralized system and the decentralized system (without signaling nor any
information sharing).
3294 ZHONGBAO ZHOU, XINGFEN LIU, FEIMIN ZHONG, YUAN CAO AND LONG ZHENG
Benchmark 1: centralized system
In this case, there is a centralized decision maker that maximizes the total supply
chain profit with full information. Hence, the total expected supply chain profit
under a given demand forecast ξ is
(r − c)E (min {K,u+ ξ + ε})− ckK.
Hence, the optimal component capacity Kcs is
Kcs = u+ ξ +G−1
(
r − c− ck
r − c
)
,
and the optimal expected supply chain profit under a given demand forecast ξ is
Πcs(ξ) = (r − c)Eε (min {Kcs, u+ ξ + ε})− ckKcs
= (r − c)
(∫ Kcs−u−ξ
−ε̄
(u+ ξ + ε)g(ε)dε+
∫ ε̄

Thus, the optimal expected supply chain profit prior to obtaining the demand fore-
cast is
Π∗ = Eξ(Π

∫ ε̄

)
f(ξ)dξ − ckKcs.
Benchmark 2: decentralized system
In this case, the supplier does not advise the retailer to adopt blockchain tech-
nology, then he builds his component capacity K before the retailer takes any
movement, then the retailer places her order D = u + ξ + ε constrained by the
component capacity K. The supplier’s expected profit is
(w − c)Eξ,ε (min {K,u+ ξ + ε})− ckK,
and it’s easy to see that the optimal component capacity is
Kds = u+ T−1
(
w − c− ck
w − c
)
, (1)
in which T is the CDF of x = ξ + ε, i.e.,
T (x) =
∫ ∞
−∞
∫ x−ξ
−∞
f(ξ)g(ε)dεdξ. (2)
Note that, the CDF T (.) should be a piecewise function due to the ξ and ε are
generally bounded. But for simplicity, here we only write the general form. Let the
PDF of x is written as t(.), then as a consequence, the supplier’s optimal expected
profit is
Πds
s =
∫ Kds−u
−ξ̄−ε̄
(w − c)(u+ x)t(x)dx+
∫ ξ̄+ε̄

The retailer’s and the supply chain’s expected profit under the supplier’s component
capacity decision Kds are

r = (r − w)Eε

Kds, u+ ξ + ε
})

RETAILER’S WILLINGNESS TO ADOPT BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY 3295
4. Model analysis. In this section, we solve the signaling game between the sup-
plier and the retailer under three different scenarios: without subsidy, the supplier
provides a direct subsidy and the supplier provides a wholesale discount.
4.1. Signaling without subsidy. According to the signaling game process that
is already described in Section 3, the sequence of events is: (1) The retailer pre-
dicts the private demand information ξ based on the historical data on her private
blockchain. (2) The retailer decides whether to adopt the blockchain technology
based on a cost M according to the value of her private demand information ξ.
(3) The supplier secures component capacity based on the behavior of the retailer.
Hence, our model is an extensive signaling game with incomplete information, and
we aim to find the perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE). The PBE of the game is(
z∗,KA∗
0 ,KA∗
1 ;
(
f b, F b
))
, in which z∗ : [−ξ̄, ξ̄] → {0, 1} is retailer’s adopting de-
cision based on her private demand information (1 means adopting and 0 means
not adopting). We assume the retailer’s decision z∗ can be any Borel measurable
function, i.e., (z∗)−1(1) is a Borel set. The supplier’s component capacity decisions
are KA∗
0 if the retailer does not adopt the blockchain technology, and KA∗
1 if the
retailer adopts the blockchain technology. It should be noted that, when the retailer
adopts the blockchain technology, the supplier knows the exact value of ξ, hence
KA∗
1 is a positive-valued function on domain [−ξ̄, ξ̄]. Finally,
(
f b, F b
)
is a Bayesian
posterior distribution of (f, F ) on [−ξ̄, ξ̄] that represents the supplier’s belief of ξ if
the retailer does not adopt the blockchain technology. The supplier will not form
any uncertain belief if the retailer adopts the blockchain technology, since the exact
value of ξ is known by the supplier.
Then when the retailer is willing to adopt the blockchain technology, the expected
profit of the supplier and the retailer are:
ΠA
s1 = (w − c)Eε
(
min
{
KA∗
1 , u+ ξ + ε
})
− ckKA∗
1 ,
ΠA
r1 = (r − w)Eε
(
min
{
KA∗
1 , u+ ξ + ε
})
−M.
Similarly, when the retailer is unwilling to adopt the blockchain technology, we
assume the supplier’s belief about ξ’s PDF f(.) and CDF F (.) will be updated to
f b(.) and F b(.), respectively, note that f b(x) = 0, if x /∈ [−ξ̄, ξ̄]. Then the expected
profit of the supplier and the retailer can be written as:
ΠA
s0 = (w − c)
∫ ∞
−∞
Eε
(
min
{
KA∗
0 , u+ ξ + ε
})
f b(ξ)dξ − ckKA∗
0 ,
ΠA
r0 = (r − w)
∫ ∞
−∞
Eε
(
min
{
KA∗
0 , u+ ξ + ε
})
f b(ξ)dξ.
(3)
To begin with, we first provide a lemma to show the retailer’s decision z∗ in PBE
is always a threshold strategy.
Lemma 4.1. If
(
z∗,KA∗
0 ,KA∗
1 (ξ);
(
f b, F b
))
is a PBE, then there exists a ξA ∈
[−ξ̄, ξ̄] such that z∗(x) = 1 if and only if x ≥ ξA.
Lemma 4.1 indicates structure of PBE and the optimality of the retailer’s thresh-
old strategy. The retailer adopts the blockchain technology if and only if the private
demand information is larger (x ≥ ξA). Since a larger private demand information
of the retailer means a higher profitability of the retailer, and the retailer is more
likely to signal the high demand information and bear the cost. The belief of the
supplier in the PBE must be the restriction of ξ on the domain [−ξ̄, ξA] if the retailer
3296 ZHONGBAO ZHOU, XINGFEN LIU, FEIMIN ZHONG, YUAN CAO AND LONG ZHENG
is willing not to adopting blockchain technology. Hence, we only need to consider
the threshold strategy of the retailer based on the cost of adopting blockchain tech-
nology. Before providing the characterizations of all the PBEs, we first provide
some preliminary results.
Lemma 4.2. Letting x be the restriction of ξ on [−ξ̄, ξy] for −ξ̄ < ξy ≤ ξ̄, i.e.,
then the PDF and CDF of x are
fξy (x) = 1{−ξ̄≤x≤ξy} ·
f(x)
F (ξy)
, Fξy (x) =
F (min{x, ξy})
F (ξy)
,
in which 1{·} is the indicator function. Assume the PDF and CDF of x + ε to be
tξy and Tξy respectively. Define the following function for all ξy ∈ (−ξ̄, ξ̄]:Ω(ξy) =

then Ω (ξy) is a bounded positive continuous function on (−ξ̄, ξ̄], and limξy→−ξ̄ Ω (ξy)
= 0. Thus, we can define Ω(−ξ̄) = 0, such that Ω is well-defined on [−ξ̄, ξ̄].
In Lemma 4.2, fξy and Fξy represent the supplier’s belief when the retailer does
not adopt blockchain technology. And (r−w)Ω(ξy) represents the profit gap of the
retailer between adopting blockchain technology or not when her private demand
information is ξy (see the proof of Theorem 4.3). In summary, for a given cost of
adopting blockchain technology, we find the retailer’s profit is equal regardless of
whether blockchain technology is adopted if (r − w)Ω(ξy)−M = 0. Then, we can
now characterize all possible PBEs in the following theorem.

RETAILER’S WILLINGNESS TO ADOPT BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY 3297

,
in which the belief of the supplier is a constant −ξ̄ (i.e.,
(
f b, F b
)
= 1{−ξ̄}) if the
retailer does not adopt the blockchain technology.
Theorem 4.3 shows that when the cost of adopting blockchain technology is large,
the retailer will not consider to adopt blockchain technology, which is reasonable.
When the cost M is in an intermediate range, the retailer will adopt blockchain
technology if and only if she predicts a high demand. When the cost M is negligi-
ble, the retailer will always adopt blockchain technology, which means the retailer
is willing to share her private demand information regardless of that her private
demand information is high or low. This result shows that, if a costless and reliable
information sharing technology exists, the advantage of more component capacity
from shared information is always larger than the loss of losing the information
advantage. This is a different conclusion from the existing article, because many
studies have shown that the retailer is usually unwilling to lose her information
advantages, or need to meet some certain conditions before she chooses to share
strategically [22, 17, 21]. The reason is that the supplier will update his belief in
different ways. In our scenario, as long as the retailer’s private demand information
is greater than a certain threshold, then the blockchain technology will be adopted.
Otherwise, the supplier will think that the retailer’s private demand information
is lower than the threshold and the retailer will lose more profit. In summary, the
retailer’s willingness of adopting blockchain technology is higher if the cost M is
lower. As the blockchain technology keeps developing, the cost M may reduce and
become negligible. Hence, our model predicts that, in the near future, most supply
chains with private demand forecast information may build blockchain technology
if the cost reduces dramatically. Further, this result also shows that the supplier
may have incentives to bear part of the retailer’s cost of adopting blockchain tech-
nology, such that a more accurate demand forecast can be shared. In the following
subsection, we consider two types of subsidy provided by the supplier.
4.2. Signaling with direct subsidy. According to the above analysis, the retailer
is never willing to adopt the blockchain technology if the cost M is too high. Hence,
the overall efficiency of the supply chain system deteriorates due to the incomplete
transparency of information. The reason may be that the retailer needs to bear
all the cost M , she is less willing to adopt the blockchain technology. In addition,
information transparency may also bring benefits to the supplier, thus he may have
an incentive to bear part of the cost M . Hence, in this subsection, we consider that
the supplier provides a direct subsidy to the retailer when she is willing to adopt
the blockchain technology.
When the supplier has not yet decided on the component capacity, he selects
a direct subsidy H to maximize his expected profit. The sequence of events is:
(1) The supplier declares the direct subsidy H. (2) The retailer decides whether
to adopt the blockchain technology according to the value of her private demand
information ξ. (3) The supplier may update the demand forecast information of the
retailer and secure the component capacity based on the behavior of the retailer.

(4) The random demand is realized, then the supplier tries to satisfy the retailer’s
order under the component capacity constraint.
When the retailer is willing to adopt the blockchain technology, the expected
profit of the supplier and the retailer are:

Similarly, when the retailer is unwilling to adopt the blockchain technology, the
expected profit of the supplier and the retailer can be written as Eq. (3).
For a given subsidy H determined by the supplier, the sub-game of the supplier
and the retailer is extremely similar to Subsection 4.1. Therefore, for the retailer’s
adopting decision, we only describe them as a remark to explain and analyze. The
following remark characterizes the PBE for a given fixed subsidy H provided by the
supplier.
Remark 1. For a given subsidy H provided by the supplier, the PBE of the fol-
lowing stages are characterized as follows. If M − H > (r − w) maxξ∈[−ξ̄,ξ̄] Ω(ξ),

(z∗(ξ) ≡ 0), then the supplier does not update the distribution of the demand

to the decentralized system.

is a PBE. That is, the adopting decision of the retailer is a non-trivial threshold
strategy anchoring on ξB . The total expected profit of the supplier, the retailer and
the supply chain can be written as:

in which the belief of the supplier is a constant −ξ̄ (i.e.,

= 1{−ξ̄}) if the
retailer does not adopt the blockchain technology.
RETAILER’S WILLINGNESS TO ADOPT BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY 3299
For a given direct subsidy H by the supplier, the above Remark implies that
there is also a threshold strategy of the retailer. The retailer adopts the blockchain
technology if and only if ξ ≥ ξB , then as a consequence, the belief of the supplier
in the PBE must be the restriction of ξ on the domain [−ξ̄, ξB ]. Similarly, the
retailer is also reluctant to adopt the blockchain technology when the cost M is too
high and then supplier’s subsidy is inadequate. We find if the supplier is willing
to bear all the cost, it is equivalent to adopting blockchain technology without
any cost for the retailer, and then the retailer will definitely be willing to adopt
the blockchain technology and the reason is similar to the previous description in
Subsection 4.1. However, is the best option for the supplier to provide full subsidies?
Next, the supplier needs to address the following optimization problem to maximize
his expected profit and find the optimal subsidy H under the equilibrium condition:
maxH (w − c)Eξ,ε
(
min
{
1{ξ≤ξB}K
∗
0 + 1{ξ≥ξB}K

B∗
1 (ξ)
)
− Eξ(1{ξ≥ξB}H).
st. (r − w) Ω(ξB)−M +H = 0, ξB ∈ [−ξ̄, ξ̄].
Because the supplier’s optimization problem is exceedingly complicated and cannot
give the optimal analytical equilibrium H, we employ the numerical method to
analyze the supplier’s optimal equilibrium in Section 5.
4.3. Signaling with wholesale discount. When the supplier is willing to bear
part of the cost M , in addition to the direct subsidy, the wholesale discount may
also play a similar role in subsidizing the retailer. Hence, in this subsection, we
consider that the supplier provides a wholesale discount to the retailer when she is
willing to adopt the blockchain technology. When the supplier has not yet decided
on the component capacity, he selects a wholesale discount δ to maximize his ex-
pected profit, where δw > c + ck (i.e., δ ∈ ((c+ ck)/w, 1]) otherwise the supplier
is unprofitable. The sequence of events is: (1) The supplier declares the wholesale
discount δ. (2) The retailer decides whether to adopt the blockchain technology
according to the value of her private demand information ξ. (3) The supplier may
update the information of the retailer’s demand forecast information and secure the
component capacity based on the retailer’s behavior. (4) The random demand is
realized, then the supplier tries to meet the retailer’s order under the component
capacity constraint.
When the retailer is willing to adopt the blockchain technology, the expected
profit of the supplier and the retailer are:
ΠC
s1 = (δw − c)Eε

{
KC∗

})
− ckKC∗

ΠC
r1 = (r − δw)Eε
(
min
{
KC∗
1 , u+ ξ + ε
})
−M.
Similarly, when the retailer is unwilling to adopt the blockchain technology, the
expected profit of the supplier and the retailer can be written as Eq. (3).
To begin with, we first provide a lemma to show that the threshold strategy is
optimal for the retailer under giving a wholesale discount by the supplier. Then,
the PBE of the following stages are characterized as follows.
Lemma 4.4. For a given wholesale discount δ provided by the supplier, if(

(
f b, F b

is a PBE, then there exists a ξC ∈ [−ξ̄, ξ̄] such that
z∗(x) = 1 if and only if x ≥ ξC .
3300 ZHONGBAO ZHOU, XINGFEN LIU, FEIMIN ZHONG, YUAN CAO AND LONG ZHENG
Lemma 4.4 indicates that there is also a threshold strategy of the retailer for
a given wholesale discount δ. Then we only need to consider the threshold, i.e.,
before knowing the private demand information, the retailer chooses a corresponding
threshold ξC based on the cost M and the wholesale discount δ provided by the
supplier. The retailer adopts the blockchain technology if and only if ξ ≥ ξC . As
a consequence, the belief of the supplier in the PBE must be the restriction of ξ
on the domain [−ξ̄, ξC ]. Before providing the characterizations of all the PBEs, we
first define a function Ψ(ξy, δ), which will be used to characterize all the PBEs.
Ψ(ξy, δ) = (r − δw)Eε
(
min
{
u+ ξy +G−1
(
δw − c− ck
δw − c
)
, u+ ξy + ε
})
− (r − w)Eε
(
min
{
u+ (T bξy )−1
(
w − c− ck
w − c
)
, u+ ξy + ε
})
.
(4)
Similarly, Ψ(ξy, δ) = M means the retailer has the same profit regardless of whether
she is willing to adopt blockchain technology, then the equilibrium about ξy is the
threshold. Next, we can characterize all possible PBEs in the following theorem,
Theorem 4.5. For a given wholesale discount δ provided by the supplier, all PBEs
can be characterized as follows:
If M ≥ supξy∈[−ξ̄,ξ̄] Ψ(ξ, δ), then

is the only PBE. That is, the retailer never adopts the blockchain technology (i.e.,
z∗ ≡ 0), then the supplier does not update the distribution of the demand forecast
(i.e.,

decentralized system.
If infξ∈[−ξ̄,ξ̄] Ψ(ξ, δ) < M < supξy∈[−ξ̄,ξ̄] Ψ(ξ, δ), letting ξC be a solution of the
equation Ψ(ξC , δ) = M , then

If M ≤ infξ∈[−ξ̄,ξ̄] Ψ(ξ, δ), the retailer always adopts the blockchain technology can

in which the belief of the supplier is a constant −ξ̄ (i.e.,
(
f b, F b
)
= 1{−ξ̄}) if the
retailer does not adopt the blockchain technology.
Theorem 4.5 shows that the retailer is unwilling to adopt the blockchain tech-
nology and the supplier may be unwilling to offer a wholesale discount when the
cost M is too large. When the cost of adopting blockchain technology is small, the
retailer is always willing to adopt the blockchain technology although the supplier
does not provide a wholesale discount. Only when the cost of adopting blockchain
technology is within a certain range, the supplier will provide a wholesale discount.
Then all the expected profits consist of two parts, i.e., when the retailer’s private
demand information is larger (smaller) than the threshold, the supplier will (not)
provide a discount to wholesale price and (does not) know the real private demand
information. Hence, the supplier needs to address the following optimization prob-
lem to maximize his expected profit and find the optimal δ under the equilibrium
condition:
maxδ1{ξ≥ξC} (δw − c)Eε
(
min
{
KC∗

st. Ψ(ξC , δ)−M = 0, ξC ∈ [−ξ̄, ξ̄].
Similarly, the supplier’s optimization problem is exceedingly complicated and can-
not give the optimal analytical equilibrium δ, thus we employ the numerical method
to analyze the supplier’s optimal equilibrium in Section 5.
5. Numerical simulation. In this section we present a numerical simulation to
find the supplier’s optimal subsidy and conduct sensitivity analysis under three
scenarios. We further explore the impact of risk-adjusted profit margin and degree
of forecast information asymmetry on the efficiency of the supplier and the retailer.
Supposing that retailer’s private demand information ξ and market uncertainty ε are
uniformly distributed over the support [−150, 150]. We find the final equilibrium is
only dependent on the critical ratio (w − c− ck) /(w − c) and M , then it suffices to
consider different values of ck and M for fixed w and c. In addition, we note w−c−ck
represents the supplier’s profit margin per unit sold and the ck represent the unit
cost of component capacity, or the holding cost when there is excess inventory. The
supplier hopes the holding cost is smaller and the profit is larger, according to [20],
we named CR = (w − c− ck) /(w − c), which can represent the supplier’s profit
level, where a larger CR means the supplier has a higher margin. Hence, we let
r = 4, w = 3 and c = 1, the ck varies from 0.04 to 0.96 and the M varies from 0 to
300. Then CR ranges from 0.02 to 0.98, which can represent the structure of the
supplier from low to high margin.
5.1. Equilibrium results. In this subsection, we first graphically illustrate the
threshold, supplier’s expected profit and retailer’s expected profit under different
scenarios. To analyze these results more clearly, we roughly divided the cost M of
3302 ZHONGBAO ZHOU, XINGFEN LIU, FEIMIN ZHONG, YUAN CAO AND LONG ZHENG
adopting blockchain technology and the supplier’s profit level CR into three types:
small, intermediate and large.
(a) (b) (c)
Figure 1. Equilibrium point ξi (where i = 0, 1, 2) with different
values of CR and M .
Equilibrium thresholds ξi (where i = A,B,C) are illustrated in Fig. 1 with dif-
ferent values of CR and M , respectively. Firstly, we find the threshold is increasing
in the cost of adopting blockchain technology M in the beginning. When M in-
creases to a sufficiently high value, ξA tends towards the upper bound of the ξ (i.e.,
ξA = 150). When M is positive, ξA is also increasing in CR. In particular, when
the supplier’s profit level CR is in a small range, the slope of ξA with respect to the
supplier’s profit level is higher. That is, when the supplier’s profit level gets lower,
the retailer’s threshold strategy is more sensitive to the supplier’s profit margin.
This suggests that the retailer is more willing to adopting blockchain technology
to share private information when the supplier’s profit level is low or the adoption
cost is low. Additionally, we find the adoption cost has a greater impact on the
retailer than the supplier’s profit level CR does. This corresponds to the reality
that a larger retailer can afford greater adoption cost and has a higher probability
of sharing private information. When the market size is comparable, the retailer
with higher profit level has a higher probability of adopting blockchain technology.
This could reflect why Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, was the first to start
adopting blockchain technology in 2016[38], while many other retailers did not. On
the one hand, Walmart’s market size is higher than other many Supermarkets, then
it she can bear a larger cost of adopting blockchain technology. On the other hand,
Wal-Mart’s suppliers have lower profit level than some other Supermarkets due to
Wal-Mart’s higher negotiating power. The reason is that[18], as the world’s largest
retailer, Walmart has huge bargaining power when it comes to its suppliers. Many
brands depend on Walmart sales to stay in business, while even larger, established
companies can little afford to be removed from Walmart’s aisles or webpages.). Sec-
ondly, from the (b) and (c) of Fig. 1, the direct subsidy and the wholesale price
discount have a similar impact on the retailer’s adopting decision. That is, ξB ≤ ξA
(or ξC ≤ ξA) when M is lower than a certain value, i.e., the threshold is smaller
when the supplier provides a subsidy, especially, when the supplier has a medium
margin product. This suggests that subsidies from the supplier can increase the
probability of the retailer sharing private information. That is, some other small
Supermarket is more willing to adopting to share private information if its supplier
can provide a subsidy.
Fig. 2 shows the retailer’s expected profit in different situations. We find that all
the retailer’s expected profits are increasing in CR, while as the cost of adopting
RETAILER’S WILLINGNESS TO ADOPT BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY 3303
blockchain technology increases, the retailer’s expected profits decrease at first, then
increases and finally become a constant. Which can be explained as follows. From
the previous theoretical analysis, the retailer’s expected profit is composed of two
parts, in information symmetry and semi-asymmetry, that is, the retailer is willing
to adopt the blockchain technology (part one) or not (part two). Therefore, when
M is in a small range, the retailer is more likely to adopt the blockchain technology,
then her expected profit mainly consists of part one. ξi (where i = A,B,C) is al-
ways increasing in M , which means the retailer’s probability of adopting blockchain
technology will be decreased, hence as M increases, the retailer’s expected profit is
decreasing in M . However, when M is in an intermediate range, the retailer may
be less likely to adopt the blockchain technology, then her expected profit is mainly
made up of part two, hence the retailer’s expected profit is increasing in M . When
M is in a large range, the retailer is unwilling to adopt the blockchain technology,
hence the retailer’s expected profit is uncorrelated with M .
(a) (b) (c)
Figure 2. The retailer’s expected profit Πr under different sce-
narios.
In addition, by comparing the three graphs in Fig. 2, we can find the retailer’s
profit may be reduced when the supplier provides a subsidy and there is no big
difference between direct subsidy and wholesale discount. That is, the supplier pro-
vides a subsidy will make the retailer be more likely to share private information,
but hurts the retailer’s profit due to the lost information advantage, thus the re-
tailer’s information advantage will be reduced by the supplier’s subsidy strategy.
Next, we present the supplier’s optimal direct subsidy H and wholesale discount
δ in Fig. 3 (Note, we find the supplier’s expected profits under different situations
are numerically similar and reasonable, i.e., all the supplier’s expected profits are
increasing in the supplier’s profit level CR and decreasing in the cost M , then we
omit it.)
Fig. 3 shows that the supplier is not willing to provide a subsidy (i.e., H = 0 and
δ = 1) when M is in a small range (or in a large range). However, when M takes an
intermediate value, H is increasing and δ is decreasing in M . Additionally, when
M is in an intermediate range, as the supplier’s profit level CR increases, the direct
subsidy H increases at first but decrease later, and reaches the maximum when the
supplier’s profit level takes an intermediate value. There are similar but opposite
conclusions for δ. That is, when the supplier is in a low margin, he is reluctant to
subsidize the retailer to avoid risks. When the supplier is in high margin, he is less
willing to subsidize because he is not afraid of over component capacity due to a the
less holding cost. This suggests that the supplier should subsidize the retailer to
3304 ZHONGBAO ZHOU, XINGFEN LIU, FEIMIN ZHONG, YUAN CAO AND LONG ZHENG
obtain more private information, especially when he is around a relatively moderate
adoption cost or profit level. That is, the supplier will subsidize the retailer when
the adoption cost reduced to a certain level due to the development of blockchain
technology. However, when the blockchain technology becomes mature and then
the adoption cost is costless, the supplier will stop providing the subsidy.

Fig. 4 shows active region for the direct subsidy and wholesale discount, we denote
them by MS and MD, respectively, where MS refers to the “Subsidy” in Subsection
4.2 and MD refer to the “Discount” in Subsection 4.3. We find MD ⊂ MS , which
means that the direct subsidy can tolerate larger cost than the wholesale discount,
thus the probability that the retailer adopts blockchain technology is larger when
the supplier provides a direct subsidy. An interesting result is that the supplier
is willing to provide subsidy only when M has an intermediate value. It’s also a
RETAILER’S WILLINGNESS TO ADOPT BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY 3305
reasonable result when M is in a large range. But when M is in a small range, if
the supplier provides a subsidy, it may also lower the threshold and increase the
probability that the retailer adopts the blockchain technology. We find ξA is small
(or ¡0) from above Fig. 1 for any CR, M . As an example, we assume that the
supplier needs to pay for H(ξ0a) to change the threshold from ξ0b to ξ0a, where
ξ0a ≤ ξ0b ≤ 0, and H(ξ0a) ≤ M . When the private demand information ξ ≥ ξ0b,
the supplier does not need to pay an extra fee H(ξ0a). But now, due to the threshold
is changed to ξ0a and the difference ξ0b − ξ0a may be smaller, the extra expected
benefit brought by information sharing may not make up for the information cost
H(ξ0a), hence the supplier chooses not to subsidize the retailer when M is in a small
range.
5.2. Comparing the three scenarios. In this subsection, we discuss the sup-
plier’s and retailer’s preferences of the three scenarios. To begin with, we graphically
illustrate the retailer’s threshold strategy under different scenarios:
Figure 5. Rough sketch structure of different threshold when M
is in an intermediate range.
To analyze this signaling game problem and threshold strategy more clearly, when
M is in an intermediate range, we graphically illustrate the threshold sketch struc-
ture in Fig. 5. The “Without subsidy”, “Direct subsidy” and “Wholesale discount”
show the different ranges [ξi, ξ̄] (where i = A,B,C) that the retailer is willing
to adopt the blockchain technology based on her private demand information ξ,
respectively. We find that ξB ≤ ξC ≤ ξA, which means providing a subsidy can mo-
tivate the retailer to share the private demand by adopting blockchain technology,
especially the direct subsidy. And the retailer is more willing to share private infor-
mation when the supplier offers a direct subsidy. Next, we explore the preferences
of the supplier and the retailer under the two subsidy strategies.
Fig. 6 indicates the supplier’s expected profit differences under the three sce-
narios. From the (a) and (b) of Fig. 6, when M is in an intermediate range, the
differences of the supplier’s expected profits (ΠB
s − ΠA
s and ΠC
s − ΠA
s ) are non-
negative. Hence, the subsidy provided by the supplier will increase his own profit.
The reason is that the supplier does not need to directly bear the cost of adopting
blockchain technology, thus the subsidy he is willing to pay may be much smaller
than the cost M . Hence, providing a subsidy is always profitable for the supplier.
Additionally, from Fig. 6(c), we find ΠB
s − ΠC
s ≥ 0 when M is in an intermediate
range, i.e., the direct subsidy performs better than wholesale discount for the sup-
plier, thus he prefers direct subsidy. That is, for the two subsidy strategies, the
supplier should provide a direct subsidy rather than wholesale discount.

(a) (b) (c)
Figure 7. Πr difference between three scenarios with different
values of CR and M .
Similarly, Fig. 7 is a comparison between the retailer’s expected profit differences.
From the (a) and (b) of Fig. 7, when M is in an intermediate range, the differences
(ΠB
r − ΠA
r and ΠC
r − ΠA
r ) are negative, which verify that the retailer will be hurt
when the supplier provides a subsidy, then the retailer prefers without any subsidy
(i.e., scenario A). The reason may be that when ξA = ξ̄, the retailer is always
unwilling to adopt the blockchain technology, then she is no need to pay the cost
M . But the subsidy may cause ξB < ξ̄ (or ξB < ξA), and the extra profit from the
subsidy H may be much smaller than the cost of adopting blockchain technology.
From Fig. 7 (c), we find the differences (ΠB
r − ΠC
r ) are non-positive, then the
retailer prefers to be provided a wholesale discount for subsidy. The main reason
is that if the supplier provides a direct subsidy, she receives a fixed subsidy H
based on ξB . However, if the supplier chooses a wholesale discount, under the
same condition, the retailer receives a subsidy that is increasing in K∗1 (ξ), where
K∗1 (ξ) = u+ ξ +G−1 ((δw − c− ck)/(δw − c)) and ξC ≤ ξ ≤ ξ̄. Hence, we suggest
that the supplier can provide a wholesale discount to benefit the retailer and whole
supply chain.
In summary, we find that subsidizing the retailer is a wise choice for the supplier,
which not only increase his own profit but also increase the probability of the retailer
adopting blockchain technology. But as the cost of adopting blockchain technology
increases, the retailer’s profit decreases and even may be worse than decentralized
system. These results are reasonable, then we omit its figure and directly explore
the expected profits in the supply chain system.

Fig. 8 shows the ratio ρ of supply chain system to the centralized system of
benchmark that we consider this paper. The profit of the system is more than 90% of
the centralized system under the three different cost-sharing methods, which means
less than 10% loss of system efficiency. Comparing with scenario ds of benchmark,
we find only when the cost of adopting blockchain technology is in a relatively small
range, the retailer should not adopt blockchain technology. In addition, when the
value of M ranges from intermediate to large, we find the system efficiency without
any subsidy is better than that with direct subsidy and wholesale discount. While
for the supplier, the direct subsidy performs worse than the wholesale discount.
The change of supply chain system profit mainly depends on the retailer’s profit,
that is, it roughly decreases at first but increases later, and finally converges to a
constant. Therefore, providing a subsidy can benefit the supplier, and increase the
retailer’s probability of adopting blockchain technology, but both the retailer and
the supply chain system will be hurt.
5.3. The effects of risk-adjusted profit margin and degree of forecast in-
formation asymmetry. In this subsection, we further explore the impact of dual
marginalization, market uncertainty and degree of information asymmetry on the
efficiency of the supplier and the retailer. Since the supplier prefers providing direct
subsidy to wholesale discount and no subsidy, then we only discuss the effects of
risk-adjusted profit margin and degree of forecast information asymmetry on the
supply chain system when a direct subsidy is provided.
We know that compared to centralized decision-making, system losses mainly
come from two aspects. One is the double marginalization, because both the supplier
and the retailer make decisions to maximize their own expected profit. The other
one is market uncertainty, i.e., the random variable ε that is modeled by a zero-
mean distribution G(.) in this article. According to [37], this inefficiency can be
measured by risk-adjusted profit margin (w−c−ck)/σε. That is the supplier’s profit
margin per unit sold per unit of market uncertainty, where (w − c− ck) represents
the supplier’s profit margin per unit sold or per unit of component capacity built.
Fig. 9 shows the profits of the supplier and the retailer with different risk-adjusted
profit margin. We find both the supplier’s and the retailer’s profits are increasing
in the risk-adjusted profit margin. This is reasonable, a larger risk-adjusted profit
3308 ZHONGBAO ZHOU, XINGFEN LIU, FEIMIN ZHONG, YUAN CAO AND LONG ZHENG
margin means that the supplier’s profit margin per unit sold is larger or the market
uncertainty is smaller, then the market become better. Comparing with the decen-
tralized system, we find the supplier’s expected profit will always become better,
while the retailer’s expected profit becomes better only when the cost of adopting
blockchain technology is smaller or when the risk-adjusted profit margin is larger.

Figure 9. Profits as a function of risk-adjusted profit margin
In addition, the degree of forecast information asymmetry is also important to the
expected profit of supply chain members. The supplier may set a small component
capacity to reduce the risk of oversupply due to lack of credible forecast information,
which may indirectly hurt the retailer’s profit. Therefore, the retailer always has
an incentive to exaggerate her demand forecast, which leads to mistrust among
supply chain members. At the same time, market uncertainty also plays a role,
i.e., if the market uncertainty is zero, then the retailer has no incentive to share
inaccurate private demand information. Then let σξ/σε represents the degree of
forecast information asymmetry [37], a larger σξ/σε means that the information
asymmetry becomes more significant, where σξ and σε are the standard deviations
of ξ and ε, respectively.
Fig. 10 shows the profits of the supplier and the retailer with different degree of
forecast information asymmetry. From Fig. 10 (a), as the degree of forecast infor-
mation asymmetry increases, we find the supplier’s profit first decreases and then
increases. We know a smaller (larger) degree of forecast information asymmetry
means the private demand information is smaller (larger) than market uncertainty,
the impact of information asymmetry on the supplier is negligible that he can ignore
it when the cost of adopting blockchain technology M is small. As the impact of
information asymmetry reaches a certain level, the supplier will take actions (e.g.,
subsidies) to obtain the private demand information from the retailer. The motiva-
tion of the supplier to obtain the private demand information becomes larger with
the impact of information asymmetry increases, which causes her profit increases.
We find as the cost of adopting blockchain technology increases, the motivation
of the supplier to obtain the private demand information and the supplier’s profit
decrease. From Fig. 10 (b), we find the retailer’s profit decreases with the de-
gree of forecast information asymmetry. Similarly, as the impact of information
asymmetry increases, the retailer will begin to adopt blockchain technology. When
the cost of adopting blockchain technology is larger (small), the retailer’s profits
RETAILER’S WILLINGNESS TO ADOPT BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY 3309
will fall at a higher (lower) rate because the retailer is less (more) likely to adopt
blockchain technology. Similarly, compared to the decentralized system, we find the
supplier’s expected profit will always become better, while the retailer’s expected
profit becomes better only when the degree of forecast information asymmetry is
larger.
Hence, in summary, when the degree of forecast information asymmetry or the
risk-adjusted profit margin is larger, the retailer prefers to adopt blockchain tech-
nology. Otherwise, she needs to prevent the supplier’s demand information from
being updated, for example, before observing the private demand information, no-
tifying the supplier that she will not adopt blockchain technology regardless of her
private demand information.

6. Extensions. To demonstrate the robustness of equilibriums, we next extend
it from two perspectives in scenario A, namely, (1) Considering the retailer’s risk
aversion; (2) Considering multiple suppliers in the market.
6.1. Risk averse retailer. In fact, decision makers have risky attitudes in many
cases[49, 3, 33]. To bring our model closer to reality, we consider the retailer to be
risk averse and the utility function is φ, where φ′ > 0, φ′′ < 0. Whereas the supplier
is assumed to be risk neutral. Such an assumption is common in literature [3, 33].
Since the supplier is risk neutral, the optimal decisions of the component capacity
are the same as Section 4.1, KD∗
1 = KA∗
1 and KD∗
0 = KA∗
0 . Then the retailer’s
utilities turn into UDr1 = Eε
(
φ(πDr1)
)
, UDr0 = Eε
(
φ(πDr0)
)
, where
πDr1 =
(
(r − w)min
{
KD∗
1 , u+ ξ + ε
}
−M
)
,
πDr0 =
(
(r − w)min
{
KD∗
0 , u+ ξ + ε
})
,
UDr1 and UDr0 represent the retailer’s expected utilities when using or not using the
blockchain, respectively. To begin with, we first provide a lemma to show that the
threshold strategy is optimal for the retailer.
Remark 2. (1) If
(
z∗,KD∗
0 ,KD∗
1 (ξ);
(
f b, F b
))
is a PBE, then there exists a ξD ∈
[−ξ̄, ξ̄] such that z∗(x) = 1 if and only if x ≥ ξD.

(r − w)
(
min
{
u+ (T bξy )−1

,
then there exists a bounded positive continuous function Φ defined on (−ξ̄, ξ̄], with
limξy→−ξ̄ Φ(ξy) = 0. Thus, we can define Φ(ξy) = 0, such that Φ(ξy) is well-defined
on [−ξ̄, ξ̄].
Next, we can characterize all possible PBEs in Remark 3, which is similar to
Theorem 4.3.
Remark 3. All PBEs can be characterized as follows:
If M ≥ supξy∈[−ξ̄,ξ̄] Φ(ξy), then
(
z∗(ξ),KD∗
0 ,KD∗
1 (ξ);
(
f b, F b
))
=
(
0,Kds, u+ ξ +G−1
(
w − c− ck
w − c
)
; (f, F )
)
is the only PBE.
If 0 < M < supξy∈[−ξ̄,ξ̄] Φ(ξy), letting ξD satisfies the equation Θ0(ξD,M)
= 0, then (z∗(ξ),KD∗
0 ,KD∗
1 (ξ);
(
f b, F b
)
) =(
1{ξD≤ξ≤ξ̄}, u+ (T bξD )−1
(
w − c− ck
w − c
)
, u+ ξ +G−1
(
w − c− ck
w − c
)
; (fξD , FξD )
)
is a PBE.
If M = 0, the retailer always adopts the blockchain technology can form a PBE,
i.e.,
(
z∗(ξ),KD∗
0 ,KD∗
1 (ξ);
(
f b, F b
))
=(
1, u− ξ̄ +G−1
(
w − c− ck
w − c
)
, u+ ξ +G−1
(
w − c− ck
w − c
)
; 1{−ξ̄}
)
,
in which the belief of the supplier is a constant −ξ̄ (i.e.,
(
f b, F b
)
= 1{−ξ̄}) if the
retailer does not adopt the blockchain technology.
Remark 3 is similar to Theorem 4.3, i.e., the retailer is only willing to adopt
blockchain technology when the cost M is in a smaller range. Therefore, we verified
the robustness of the PBE by considering the retailer’s risk aversion when there is
no subsidy. That is, the retailer’s risk aversion only change the threshold of that
the retailer is willing to share private information, which is closely dependent on the
retailer’s utility function of risk averse. Additionally, we find if the cost of adopting
blockchain technology is costless, the retailer should share the private information
regardless of her utility function. For some small retailers with small market size or
financial constraints, it is often risk-averse due to the inability to bear higher losses.
However, we suggest that they should adopt blockchain technology to facilitate
information sharing to get additional expected profit if the cost of blockchain is
low. We can also show that the results are similar to Sections 4.2 and 4.3 when
the supplier provides direct subsidy or wholesale discount. The detailed results and
proofs are omited to save space.
RETAILER’S WILLINGNESS TO ADOPT BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY 3311
6.2. Multiple suppliers. In this subsection, according to [35], we assume one
retailer in the market that sells n different types of products, supplied by n suppliers,
respectively. Assuming that the n suppliers are already on the blockchain system. If
the retailer adopts blockchain technology, her private information becomes a public
knowledge to all suppliers. Assuming that the demand of i-th supplier can be
expressed as Di = ui + λiξ + εi, where ξ is the retailer’s private information with
CDF F and PDF f , and λi represents the impact of the retailer’s private information
to i-th product’s demand, ui is a common knowledge that represents the average
market demand of product i, and εi is a zero-mean continuous random variable with
PDF gi(.) and CDF Gi(.) supported on [−ε̄i, ε̄i]. Then the sequence of events is: (1)
The retailer decides whether to adopt the blockchain technology based on the cost
M and the value of her private demand information ξ. (2) All the suppliers secure
component capacities based on the behavior of the retailer. Similar to Section 4.1,
the optimal decisions of i-th supplier are KE∗

when
the retailer adopts blockchain, and KE∗
0i =

/λi when the
retailer does not adopt blockchain technology. Hence, the retailer’s profits are,
respectively,

(r − w)Eεi

Similarly to Lemmas 4.1 and 4.2, we have the following Remark 4.
Remark 4. (1) If
(
z∗,KE∗
0 ,KE∗
1 (ξ);
(
f b, F b
))
is a PBE, then there exists a
ξE ∈ [−ξ̄, ξ̄] such that z∗(x) = 1 if and only if x ≥ ξE .
(2) Letting Ξ(ξy) =
(r − w)
(
n∑
i=1
(Eεi
(
min
{
KE∗
1i , ui + λiξ + εi
})
− Eεi
(

})
)
)
,
then Ξ(ξy) is a bounded positive continuous function on (−ξ̄, ξ̄], and
limξy→−ξ̄ Ξ(ξy) = 0. Thus, we can define Ξ(−ξ̄) = 0, such that Ξ(ξy) is well-defined
on [−ξ̄, ξ̄]. Additionally, Ξ(ξy) is increasing in n.
Next, we can characterize all possible PBEs in Remark 5, which is similar to
Theorem 4.3.
Remark 5. All PBEs can be characterized as follows:
If M ≥ supξy∈[−ξ̄,ξ̄] Ξ(ξ), then

is the only PBE.
If 0 < M < supξy∈[−ξ̄,ξ̄] Ξ(ξ), letting ξE be a solution of the equation Ξ(ξE) = M ,
then (z∗(ξ),KE∗

(

; (fξE , FξE )
)
is a PBE.
3312 ZHONGBAO ZHOU, XINGFEN LIU, FEIMIN ZHONG, YUAN CAO AND LONG ZHENG
If M = 0, the retailer always adopts the blockchain technology can form a PBE,
i.e.,
(
z∗(ξ),KE∗

(

=(

; 1{−ξ̄}
)
,
in which the belief of the supplier is a constant −ξ̄ (i.e.,
(
f b, F b
)
= 1{−ξ̄}) if the
retailer does not adopt the blockchain technology.
Remark 5 is similar to Theorem 4.3, i.e., the retailer is only willing to adopt
blockchain technology when the cost M is in an intermediate range when there is
no subsidy. Therefore, we verified the robustness of the results when considering
multiple suppliers. In addition to these, we also obtain somea new management in-
sights. Since Ξ(ξy) is increasing in n, supξy∈[−ξ̄,ξ̄] Ξ(ξ) is also increasing in n. That
is, a retailer with larger number of suppliers is more likely to adopt blockchain tech-
nology. Whereas, retailers with fewer suppliers are less likely to adopt blockchain
technology. And the result suggests that, in the current stage, the cost of adopt-
ing blockchain technology is high. Thus, only those large retailers with various of
suppliers should use blockchain technology. However, as the blockchain technology
goes mature in the future, the cost will be reduced significantly, and all retailers
should use blockchain technology.

To connect our conclusions with the real industry, we select 14 retailers and col-
lect the number of their suppliers and blockchain technology adoption information.
RETAILER’S WILLINGNESS TO ADOPT BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY 3313
The number of their suppliers are obtained from ‘tianyancha.com’ and ‘qcc.com’,
which provide public information about suppliers’ information of retailers in China.
And we also checked the official website of these retailers to find out whether the
blockchain technology is adopted. According to Table 1, we can see that the first
three retailers have adopted blockchain technology. In addition, Carrefour also
has adopted blockchain technology, and it has verified 444 suppliers in the IPE
database of different industries according to [4]. However, the data collected from
‘tianyancha.com’ and ‘qcc.com’ only include those suppliers’ information of retailers
in China. Hence, recall our conclusion that the probability of adopting blockchain
technology is higher for retailers with multiple suppliers. We verify that large re-
tailers like Walmart, YONGHUI, Amazon and Carrefour have adopted blockchain
technology. However, to the best of our knowledge, the adoption of blockchain tech-
nology may be influenced by many factors. Therefore, although the retailers like
Metro AG, Metro AG, Hyper-mart, JIAJIAYUE and Auchan also have more sup-
pliers, they have not adopted blockchain technology. The reason may be that the
profit level of their suppliers is high, or the development of blockchain technology
is not mature enough and then the investment cost is high.
Conclusions. This article considers a two-echelon supply chain consisting of a
supplier and a retailer, where the retailer has more accurate demand forecasts. By
assuming that blockchain technology can guarantee the accuracy of information
delivery, this paper mainly discusses that under what conditions the retailer is
willing to adopt the blockchain technology. Three different scenarios are considered:
the retailer bears all the cost, the supplier bears part of the cost by providing a
direct subsidy or a wholesale discount. We focus on exploring the conditions for the
retailer to adopt blockchain technology and the supplier’s subsidy strategy choice
under information asymmetry, the obtained results contribute to both research and
practice for the supplier and the retailer.
Firstly, we find PBE always exists and the retailer’s optimal decision of adopting
blockchain technology is a simple threshold strategy, i.e., the retailer will join the
blockchain technology if and only if her private information exceeds a threshold.
We find that this threshold is closely dependent on the cost of adopting blockchain
technology, the supplier’s profit level, and the number of suppliers. That is, the
probability of the retailer to adopt blockchain technology decrease with the adoption
cost and the supplier’s profit level, where the adoption cost has a greater impact.
On the one hand, the retailer with larger market size can afford a higher adoption
cost and thus has a higher probability of adopting blockchain technology. On the
other hand, the retailer with larger market size has higher bargaining power, which
will lead to a lower profit level for her supplier, which also makes her be more likely
to adopt blockchain technology. In addition, the number of the retailer’s suppliers
has a negative effect on the threshold, i.e., the retailer with the presence of more
suppliers has a higher probability of adopting blockchain technology. Thus, our
results reflect the reality from these three aspects, the large retailers like Wal-Mart
and Carrefour will first adopt blockchain technology.
Secondly, from exploring the supplier’s subsidy strategy, we find the supplier
is more willing to provide a subsidy when his profit level or the cost of adopting
blockchain technology is around an intermediate range. While when the cost of
adopting blockchain technology is in a small (large) range, the supplier is not willing
to provide subsidy. Noteworthy, providing subsidies are always profitable for the
3314 ZHONGBAO ZHOU, XINGFEN LIU, FEIMIN ZHONG, YUAN CAO AND LONG ZHENG
supplier, and he prefers the direct subsidy to the wholesale discount. Additionally,
comparing with no subsidy, we find both the direct subsidy and wholesale discount
can enhance the retailer’s possibility of adopting blockchain technology and benefit
the supplier, but both the retailer and the supply chain system will be hurt. Hence,
this result also predicts that subsidies do not necessarily benefit the subsidized party
in an information asymmetry scenarios. The supplier should always seek to provide
some subsidies to the retailer to increase the probability of true sharing of private
information.
Finally, from exploring the impact of dual marginalization, market uncertainty
and degree of information asymmetry on the efficiency of the supplier and the
retailer. We find the degree of forecast information asymmetry increases, the sup-
plier’s profit first decreases and then increases, while the retailer’s profit always
decreases. The retailer is more likely to adopt blockchain technology when the de-
gree of forecast information asymmetry or the risk-adjusted profit margin is larger.
Furthermore, we find that the threshold strategy is still optimal for the retailer
when considering the retailer’s risk aversion or multiple suppliers.
Our paper studies the problem based on some assumptions. The following is a
brief summary of the shortcomings in this paper and some suggestions that can be
considered in the future. All price variables considered in this paper are exogenous,
which can be combined with the demand function in future research. This paper
assumes that both the supplier and the retailer are completely rational. However,
many researches on behavior in recent years have shown that people can only be
partially rational in the actual situation.

Note that, KA∗

dDIFF

i.e., DIFF is an increasing function. Thus, the retailer adopts the blockchain
technology if and only if ξ is larger than a certain threshold ξA.
Appendix B. Proof of Lemma 4.2.
Proof. let q1 = G−1
(
w−c−ck

)
, q2(y) = (T by )−1
(
w−c−ck
w−c
)
,
then G(q1) = T by (q2(y)) = P (ξ + ε ≤ q2(y) |ξ ≤ y ) ≥ P (y + ε ≤ q2(y))
= P (ε ≤ q2(y)− y) = G(q2(y)− y). Therefore, we have q1 ≥ q2(y)− y and
Ω(y) = E (min {q1, ε})− E (min {q2(y)− y, ε}) ≥ 0,
i.e., Ω(y) is a positive function.
Let {yi} be any sequence such that limi→∞ yi = −ξ̄. If q2(yi) = (T byi)
−1
(
w−c−ck
w−c
)
do not converge to q1− ξ̄, then there exists a λ > 0 and a subsequence zi of yi such
that |q2(zi)− q1 + ξ̄| > λ for all i ≥1. Hence, either q2(zi) > q1 + λ− ξ̄ for infinite
i or q2(zi) < q1 − λ− ξ̄ for infinite i.
If q2(zi) > q1 + λ − ξ̄ for infinite i, there exist CR sufficiently large i such that
q2(zi) > q1 + λ− ξ̄ and |zi + ξ̄| < λ/3 (since zi → −ξ̄). Thus, we have

which is also a contradiction.
Therefore, q2(yi) = (T byi)

converge to q1 − ξ̄, i.e.,
lim
y→−ξ̄
q2(y) = q1 − ξ̄. (9)
As a result, we have
lim
y→−ξ̄
Ω(y) = E(min{q1, ε})− lim
y→−ξ̄
E(min{q2(y)− y, ε}) = 0. (10)
Finally, we show that Ω(y) is continuous on (−ξ̄, ξ̄]. Since Ω(y) = E(min{q1, ε})−
E(min{q2(y)− y, ε}), it suffices to show that q2(y) is continuous on (−ξ̄, ξ̄]. For any
e ∈ (−ξ̄, ξ̄] and a sequence yi that converges to e. If q2(yi) do not converge to q2(e),
there exists a λ > 0 and a subsequence zi, such that |q2(zi) − q2(e)| > λ. Since
T bzi(q2(zi)) = w−c−ck
w−c ∈ (0, 1), q2(zi) are all in the range [−ξ̄− ε̄, ξ̄+ ε̄]. Thus, q2(zi)
have a convergence subsequence q2(xi), and assume q2(xi) → Q 6= q2(e). Then we
have
T be (q2(e)) =
w − c− ck

(11)
Note that T be is the CDF of ξe + ε, which is strictly increasing in the support
[−ξ̄ − ε̄, e+ ε̄]. Thus, it must hold Q = q2(e), which is a contradiction. Thus, Ω(y)
is continuous on (−ξ̄, ξ̄], and the Lemma 4.2 is proved.
Appendix C. Proof of Theorem 4.3.
Proof. According to subsection 4.1, the decision-making process of this problem can
be divided into two stages. The first stage is that the retailer decides whether to
adopt the blockchain technology, and the second stage is that the supplier decides
RETAILER’S WILLINGNESS TO ADOPT BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY 3317
the component capacity based on the two situations of the retailer adopting or not
adopting. As shown in Fig. 11 below.
Figure 11. The decision-making process.
Assume
(
z∗(ξ),KA∗
0 ,KA∗
1 (ξ);
(
f b, F b
))
to be a PBE, then according to Lemma
4.1, we know that the retailer will always adopt threshold strategy, hence the belief
of the supplier (i.e.,
(
f b, F b
)
) is a restriction of (f, F ) on [−ξ̄, ξy] (f(x) = 0, if
x /∈ [−ξ̄, ξy]) for some ξy ∈ [−ξ̄, ξ̄]. We first characterize all non-trivial PBEs such
that the retailer’s threshold is not −ξ̄ or ξ̄, i.e., ξy ∈ (−ξ̄, ξ̄).
If the retailer adopts the blockchain technology, the expected profit of the supplier
is
ΠA
s1 = (w − c)Eε (min {K1, u+ ξ + ε})− ckK1,
then he maximizes his expected profit to obtain the optimal KA∗
1 , i.e.,
KA∗
1 (ξ) = u+ ξ +G−1
(
w − c− ck
w − c
)
. (12)
If the retailer does not adopt the blockchain technology, the expected profit of
the supplier can be written as
ΠA
s0 = (w − c)
∫ ∞
−∞
Eε (min {K0, u+ ξ + ε}) f b(ξ)dξ − ckK0,
then he maximizes his expected profit to obtain the optimal KA∗
0 , i.e.,
KA∗
0 = u+ (T bξy )−1
(
w − c− ck
w − c
)
. (13)
Now we need to solve the problem of the first stage. From Eq. (12) and (13), if
the retailer does not adopt the blockchain technology, the retailer’s expected profit
can be expressed as
ΠA
r1 = (r − w)Eε
(
min
{
KA∗
1 (ξ), u+ ξ + ε
})
−M.
And if the retailer adopts the blockchain technology, the retailer’s expected profit
can be expressed as
ΠA
r0 = (r − w)Eε
(
min
{
KA∗
0 , u+ ξ + ε
})
.
3318 ZHONGBAO ZHOU, XINGFEN LIU, FEIMIN ZHONG, YUAN CAO AND LONG ZHENG
Hence, the retailer will adopt the blockchain technology if and only if
ΠA
r1 ≥ ΠA
r0, i.e.,
ΠA

−M ≥ 0.
According to Lemma 4.1, ΠA
r1 − ΠA
r0 (Eq. (8)) is increasing in retailer’s private
demand information ξ. Hence, there exists a ξA ∈ [−ξ̄, ξ̄], such that ΠA
r1 −ΠA
r0 ≥ 0
is equivalent to ξ ≥ ξA. Note that the belief must satisfy the Bayesian rule, thus it
must hold ξy = ξA, i.e., (r − w)Ω(ξA) = M .
Therefore, ifM > (r−w) maxξ∈[−ξ̄,ξ̄] Ω(ξ), there does not exist a non-trivial PBE.
In this case, we know that the retailer never adopts the blockchain technology can
form a PBE, i.e.,(
z∗(ξ),KA∗

(
f b, F b
))
=
(
0,Kds, u+ ξ +G−1
(

)
; (f, F )
)
.
First, it’s easy to see that KA∗
0 and KA∗
1 (ξ) are the optimal equilibrium of the
supplier based on the retailer’s choice and belief (f, F ) (i.e.,
(
fξ̄, Fξ̄
)
). Hence, we
only need to show that the retailer will never adopt the blockchain technology, that
is ξA = ξ̄ and ΠA
r1 −ΠA
r0 ≤ 0 holds for all ξ ∈ [−ξ̄, ξ̄]. Note that Eq. (12) and (13),
thus we can get

, ξ + ε
})
− M
r − w
.
To show (ΠA
r1 −ΠA
r0)/(r − w) ≤ 0, we first prove that
q2(x) = (T bx)−1 ((w − c− ck)/(w − c)) is increasing in x.
According to T (q2(x)) = G(q1) = (w − c− ck)/(w − c) and
w − c− ck

= P (ξ + ε ≤ q2(x) |ξ ≤ x ) =

then

G(q2(x)− ξ)f(ξ)dξ.
Taking the derivative of both sides with respect to x, we have

−∞
g(q2(x)− ξ)f(t)dξ − w − c− ck
w − c
f(x) = 0

then, according to q1 ≥ q2(y)− y in proving of Lemma 4.2,
dq2(x)

g(q2(x)− ξ)f(t)dξ =

= (

−G(q2(x)− x))f(x) = (G(q1)−G(q2(x)− x))f(x) ≥ 0.
Then q2(ξ) = (T bξ )−1 ((w − c− ck)/(w − c)) is increasing in ξ, from this we can get

then if M > (r − w) maxξ∈[−ξ̄,ξ̄] Ω(ξ), ΠA
r1 − ΠA
r0 ≤ 0, hence the retailer will never
adopt the blockchain technology and the belief of the supplier is independent with
the retailer’s behavior, i.e., (f, F ).
If 0 < M ≤ (r − w) maxξ∈[−ξ̄,ξ̄] Ω(ξ), according to Lemma 4.1, then there is a
ξA, such that M = (r − w)Ω(ξA), and the PBE is(

Finally, for M = 0, there is a PBE such that the retailer always adopts the

First, it’s easy to see that KA∗
0 and KA∗
1 (ξ) are the optimal equilibrium of the
supplier based on the retailer’s choice and belief 1{−ξ̄} (i.e., (f−ξ̄, F−ξ̄)). Hence,
we only need to show that the retailer will always adopt the blockchain technology
when the belief of the supplier is 1{−ξ̄}. That is, ΠA

r0 ≥ 0 holds for all
ξ ∈ [−ξ̄, ξ̄]. Note that Eq. (12) and (13), hence

Then Theorem 4.3 is proved.
3320 ZHONGBAO ZHOU, XINGFEN LIU, FEIMIN ZHONG, YUAN CAO AND LONG ZHENG
Appendix D. Proof of Lemma 4.4.
Proof. Similar result with Section 4.1 when the retailer with private demand infor-
mation ξ does not adopt the blockchain technology. Hence, we only consider that
the retailer with private demand information ξ adopts the blockchain technology,
the supplier will solve the following problem to find KC∗
1 ,
KC∗
1 = argmaxK(δw − c)
∫ ε̄
−ε̄
min{K,u+ ξ + ε}g(ε)dε− ckK
= u+ ξ +G−1
(
δw − c− ck
δw − c
)
.
(14)
Else if the retailer does not adopt the blockchain technology, we have
KC∗
0 = KA∗
0 = u + (T bξC )−1 ((w − c− ck)/(w − c)) by maximizing his profit. And
the profit of the retailer with private demand information ξ is
(r − δw)
∫ ε̄
−ε̄
min{KC∗
1 , u+ ξ + ε}g(ε)dε−M
=(r − δw)(u+ ξ) + (r − δw)
∫ ε̄
−ε̄
min
{
G−1
(
δw − c− ck
δw − c
)
, ε
}
g(ε)dε−M.
Thus, for a given δ by supplier, the retailer adopts the blockchain technology if and
only if DIFF (ξ)
= (r − δw)Eε(min{KC∗
1 , u+ ξ + ε})−M − (r − w)Ey,ε(min{KC∗
0 , u+ y + ε})
=(r − δw)(u+ ξ) + (r − δw)
∫ ε̄

}
g(ε)dε−M

∫ ε̄
−ε̄
min{u+ (T bξy )−1
(
w − c− ck
w − c
)
, u+ ξ + ε}g(ε)dε ≥ 0.
(15)
Note that, KC∗
0 is independent of ξ, we have
dDIFF
dξ
(ξ) =(r − δw)− (r − w)(G(KC∗
0 − u− ξ))
≥(r − w)− (r − w)(G(KC∗
0 − u− ξ))
≥0.
i.e., DIFF is an increasing function in ξ. Hence, for a given δ by supplier, the
retailer will find a certain threshold ξC , and adopt the blockchain technology if and
only if ξ is larger than a certain threshold ξC .
Appendix E. Proof of Theorem 4.5.
Proof. According to Subsection 4.3, the decision-making process of this problem
can be divided into three stages. The first stage is that the supplier chooses an
optimal wholesale discount δ to the retailer, the second stage is that the retailer
decides whether to adopt the blockchain technology, and the third stage is that the
supplier decides the component capacity based on the two situations of the retailer
adopting or not adopting.
Assume
(
z∗(ξ),KC∗
0 ,KC∗
1 (ξ);
(
f b, F b
))
to be a PBE, then according to Lemma
4.4, we know that the retailer will always adopt threshold strategy, hence the belief
of the supplier (i.e.,
(
f b, F b
)
) is a restriction of (f, F ) on [−ξ̄, ξy] for some ξy ∈
RETAILER’S WILLINGNESS TO ADOPT BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY 3321
(−ξ̄, ξ̄]. We first characterize all non-trivial PBEs such that the retailer’s threshold
is not −ξ̄ or ξ̄, i.e., ξy ∈ (−ξ̄, ξ̄).
If the retailer adopts the blockchain technology, the expected profit of the supplier
is
ΠC
s1 = (δw − c)Eε (min {K1, u+ ξ + ε})− ckK1,
then he maximizes his expected profit to obtain the optimal KC∗
1 as Eq (14) Sim-
ilarly, if the retailer does not adopt the blockchain technology, the optimal KC∗
0 is
equal to the Eq. (13).
Now we need to solve the problem of the second stage that when the retailer
is willing to adopt the blockchain technology. From Eq. (12) and (13), if the
retailer does not adopt the blockchain technology, the retailer’s expected profit can
be expressed as
ΠC
r1 = (r − δw)Eε
(
min
{
KC∗
1 (ξ), u+ ξ + ε
})
−M.
And if the retailer adopts the blockchain technology, the retailer’s expected profit
can be expressed as
ΠC
r0 = (r − w)Eε
(
min
{
KC∗
0 , u+ ξ + ε
})
.
Hence, the retailer is willing to adopt the blockchain technology if and only if
ΠC
r1 ≥ ΠC
r0, i.e., ΠC
r1 −ΠC
r0 =
(r − δw)Eε
(
min
{
KC∗
1 (ξ), u+ ξ + ε
})
−M − (r − w)Eε
(
min
{
KC∗
0 , u+ ξ + ε
})
= (r − δw)Eε
(
min
{
u+ ξ +G−1
(
δw − c− ck
δw − c
)
, u+ ξ + ε
})
− (r − w)Eε
(
min
{
u+ (T bξy )−1
(
w − c− ck
w − c
)
, u+ ξ + ε
})
−M
≥ 0,
According to Lemma 4.4, ΠC
r1 − ΠC
r0 (Eq. (G)) is increasing in retailer’s private
demand information ξ. Hence, there exists a ξC ∈ [−ξ̄, ξ̄], such that ΠC
r1 −ΠC
r0 ≥ 0
is equivalent to ξ ≥ ξC . Note that the belief must satisfy the Bayesian rule, thus it
must hold ξy = ξC , i.e., Ψ(ξC , δ) = M .
Therefore, if M ≥ supξy∈[−ξ̄,ξ̄] Ψ(ξ, δ), there does not exist a non-trivial PBE.
In this case, we know that the retailer never adopts the blockchain technology can
form a PBE, i.e.,
(
z∗(ξ),KC∗
0 ,KC∗
1 (ξ);
(
f b, F b
))
=
(
0,Kds, u+ ξ +G−1
(
w − c− ck
w − c
)
; (f, F )
)
.
First, it’s easy to see that KC∗
0 and KC∗
1 (ξ) are the optimal equilibrium of the
supplier based on the retailer’s choice and belief (f, F ), i.e.,
(
fξ̄, Fξ̄
)
. Hence, we
only need to show that the retailer will never adopt the blockchain technology, that
is ξC = ξ̄ and ΠC
r1 − ΠC

If M ≥ supξ∈[−ξ̄,ξ̄] Ψ(ξ, δ), then ΠC
r1 − ΠC
r0 ≤ 0 and the retailer will never adopt
the blockchain technology, thus the belief of the supplier is
(
fξ̄, Fξ̄
)
= (f, F ).
If infξ∈[−ξ̄,ξ̄] Ψ(ξ, δ) < M < supξ∈[−ξ̄,ξ̄] Ψ(ξ, δ), according to Lemma 4.4, then
there is a ξC , such that M = Ψ(ξC , δ), and the PBE is(

Finally, for M ≤ infξ∈[−ξ̄,ξ̄] Ψ(ξ, δ), there is a PBE such that the retailer always
adopts the blockchain technology, that is we check the following decisions and belief
satisfy the conditions of PBE,
(
z∗(ξ),KC∗

,
First, it’s easy to see that KC∗
0 and KC∗
1 (ξ) are the optimal equilibrium of the
supplier based on the retailer’s choice and belief 1{−ξ̄}. Hence, we only need to show
that the retailer will always adopt the blockchain technology when the belief of the
supplier is 1{−ξ̄}. That is, ΠC
r1−ΠC
r0 ≥ 0 holds for all ξ ∈ [−ξ̄, ξ̄]. Note that Eq. (14)
and (13), then according to the proof of Theorem 4.3, (T bx)−1 ((w − c− ck)/(w − c))
is increasing in x, ΠC

r0 =

Hence, if M ≤ infξ∈[−ξ̄,ξ̄] Ψ(ξ, δ), then ΠC

r0 ≥ 0 and the Theorem 4.5 is
proved.
RETAILER’S WILLINGNESS TO ADOPT BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY 3323
Appendix F. Proof of Remark 2.
Proof. We will it prove in two steps. (1) Firstly, we have the supplier’s decision are
similar to that in the proof of 4.3, i.e., KD∗
1 = KA∗
1 and KD∗
0 = KA∗
0 .
And the utilities of the retailer with private demand information ξ are UDr1 =
Eε
(
φ(πDr1)
)
, UDr0 = Eε
(
φ(πDr1)
)
. Thus, the retailer adopts the blockchain technology
if and only if
Eε
(
φ
(
πDr1
)
− φ
(
πDr0
))
= Eε
(
φ
(
(r − w)min
{
KD∗
1 , u+ ξ + ε
}
−M
))
− Eε
(
φ
(
(r − w)min
{
KD∗
0 , u+ ξ + ε
}))
≥ 0.
(16)
Note that, KD∗
0 is independent of ξ, we have Eε
(
(∂(φ
(
πDr1
)
− φ
(
πDr0
)
))/∂ξ
)
= Eε
(
∂φ
(
πDr1
)
∂ξ
1{ε<KD∗
0 −u−ξ} + (
∂φ
(
πDr1
)
∂ξ
−
∂φ
(
πDr0
)
∂ξ
)1{ε>KD∗
0 −u−ξ}
)
= Eε
(
1{ε<KD∗
0 −u−ξ}φ(πDr1)′(r − w) + 1{ε>KD∗
0 −u−ξ}(φ(πDr1)′ − φ(ΠB
r1)′)(r − w)
)
= Eε
(
1{ε<KD∗
0 −u−ξ}φ
′(πDr1)(r − w)
+ 1{ε>KD∗
0 −u−ξ}(φ
′((r − w)(u+ ξ + ε)−M)− φ′ ((r − w)(u+ ξ + ε)) (r − w))
)
Firstly, we know φ′((r − w)(u + ξ + ε) −M) − φ′ ((r − w)(u+ ξ + ε)) > 0 due to
φ′ > 0 and φ′′ < 0. Hence, we have ∂(φ
(
πDr1
)
− φ
(
πDr0
)
)/∂ξ > 0 always holds,
then i.e., φ
(
πDr1
)
− φ
(
πDr0
)
is an increasing function. Thus, the retailer adopts the
blockchain technology if and only if ξ is larger than a certain threshold ξD.
(2) Letting Θ0(ξy,M)
= Eε
(
φ
(
(r − w) min
{
u+ ξy +G−1
(
w − c− ck
w − c
)
, u+ ξy + ε
}
−M
)
− φ
(
(r − w) min
{
u+ (T bξy )−1
(
w − c− ck
w − c
)
, u+ ξy + ε
}))
,
= Eε (φ ((r − w) [(u+ ξy) + min {q1, ε}]−M)
−φ ((r − w) [(u+ ξy) + min {q2− ξy, ε}])) ,
(17)
where q1 = G−1
(
w−c−ck
w−c
)
, q2 = (T bξy )−1
(
w−c−ck
w−c
)
.
According to the proof of Theorem 4.1, we have limξ→−ξ̄ q2(y) = q1 − ξ̄. Hence,
we have q1 > q2(y)− y, therefore Θ0(ξy, 0) ≥ 0. While limM→∞Θ0(ξy,M) ≤ 0 due
to ∂Θ0(ξy,M)/∂M < 0 holds. Then there is a continuous Φ(ξy) on (−ξ̄, ξ̄], where
Θ0(ξy,Φ(ξy)) = 0 holds. That is, Θ0(ξy,M) = 0 has a unique solution M = Φ(ξy).
Next, we need prove that Φ(ξy) is positive, we note Θ0(ξy, 0) ≥ 0 and
Θ0(ξy,Φ(ξy)) = 0 hold, then Φ(ξy) ≥ 0 due to ∂Θ0(ξy,M)/∂M < 0.
Finally, we need prove limξy→−ξ̄ Φ(ξy) = 0. If limξy→−ξ̄ Φ(ξy) 6= 0, then there
exists a sequence {yi}∞i=1, such that limn→∞ yi → −ξ̄ and limn→∞Θ(yi) → κ,
where κ > 0. We have 0 = limn→∞Θ0(yi,Θ(yi)) < limn→∞Θ0(yi, 0) = 0, which is
a contradiction. Hence, limξy→−ξ̄ Φ(ξy) = 0 must be hold.
Appendix G. Proof of Remark 3.
Proof. Assume
(
z∗(ξ),KD∗
0 ,KD∗
1 (ξ);
(
f b, F b
))
to be a PBE, then according to Re-
mark 2, we know that the retailer will always adopt threshold strategy, hence the
belief of the supplier (i.e.,
(
f b, F b
)
) is a restriction of (f, F ) on [−ξ̄, ξy] (f(x) = 0, if
3324 ZHONGBAO ZHOU, XINGFEN LIU, FEIMIN ZHONG, YUAN CAO AND LONG ZHENG
x /∈ [−ξ̄, ξy]) for some ξy ∈ [−ξ̄, ξ̄]. We first characterize all non-trivial PBEs such
that the retailer’s threshold is not −ξ̄ or ξ̄, i.e., ξy ∈ (−ξ̄, ξ̄).
For the supplier, his decision is similar with scenario A, i.e., the optimal decisions
of the component capacity are the same as Section 4.1, KD∗
1 = KA∗
1 and
KD∗
0 = KA∗
0 . Now we need to solve the problem of the first stage. From Eq. (12)
and (13), the retailer’s utilities can be expressed as
ΠD
r1 = Eε
(
φ
(
(r − w)min
{
KD∗
1 , u+ ξ + ε
}
−M
))
,
ΠD
r0 = Eε
(
φ
(
(r − w)min
{
KD∗
0 , u+ ξ + ε
}
f b(ξ)
))
.
Hence, the retailer will adopt the blockchain technology if and only if ΠD
r1 ≥ ΠD
r0,
i.e., Thus, the retailer adopts the blockchain technology if and only if
φ
(
ΠD
r1
)
− φ
(
ΠD
r0
)
= Eε
(
φ
(
(r − w)min
{
KD∗
1 , u+ ξ + ε
}
−M
))
− Eε
(
φ
(
(r − w)min
{
KD∗
0 , u+ ξ + ε
}))
≥ 0.
According to Remark 2, ΠD
r1 − ΠD
r0 (Eq. (16)) is increasing in retailer’s private
demand information ξ. Hence, there exists a ξD ∈ [−ξ̄, ξ̄], such that ΠD
r1 −ΠD
r0 ≥ 0
is equivalent to ξ ≥ ξD. Note that the belief must satisfy the Bayesian rule, thus
it must hold ξy = ξD, i.e., M = Θ(ξy). Therefore, if M > maxξy∈[−ξ̄,ξ̄] Φ(ξy),
there does not exist a non-trivial PBE. In this case, we know that the retailer never
adopts the blockchain technology can form a PBE, i.e.,(
z∗(ξ),KD∗
0 ,KD∗
1 (ξ);
(
f b, F b
))
=
(
0,Kds, u+ ξ +G−1
(
w − c− ck
w − c
)
; (f, F )
)
.
First, it’s easy to see that KD∗
0 and KD∗
1 (ξ) are the optimal equilibrium of the
supplier based on the retailer’s choice and belief (f, F ) (i.e.,
(
fξ̄, Fξ̄
)
). Hence, we
only need to show that the retailer will never adopt the blockchain technology, that
is ξA = ξ̄ and ΠD
r1 −ΠD
r0 ≤ 0 holds for all ξ ∈ [−ξ̄, ξ̄]. Note that Eq. (12) and (13),
thus we can get
(
φ
(
ΠD
r1
)
− φ
(
ΠD
r0
))
= Eε
(
φ
(
(r − w)min
{
G−1
(
w − c− ck
w − c
)
, u+ ξ + ε
}
−M
))
− Eε
(
φ
(
(r − w)min
{
(T bξ̄ )−1
(
w − c− ck
w − c
)
, u+ ξ + ε
}))
.
From (T bξ )−1 ((w − c− ck)/(w − c)) is increasing in ξ, we can get
Eε
(
φ
(
πDr1
)
− φ
(
πDr0
))
= Eε
(
φ
(
(r − w)min
{
G−1
(
w − c− ck
w − c
)
, u+ ξ + ε
}
−M
))
− Eε
(
φ
(
(r − w)min
{
(T bξ̄ )−1
(
w − c− ck
w − c
)
, u+ ξ + ε
}))
≤ Eε
(
φ
(
(r − w)min
{
G−1
(
w − c− ck

)
, u+ ξ + ε
}
−M
))
− Eε
(
φ
(
(r − w)min
{
(T bξ )−1
(
w − c− ck
w − c
)
, u+ ξ + ε
}))
= Θ(ξ,M).
then if M > maxξy∈[−ξ̄,ξ̄] Φ(ξy), ΠD
r1 − ΠD
r0 ≤ 0, hence the retailer will never adopt
the blockchain technology and the belief of the supplier is independent with the
RETAILER’S WILLINGNESS TO ADOPT BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY 3325
retailer’s behavior, i.e., (f, F ). If 0 < M ≤ maxξy∈[−ξ̄,ξ̄] Φ(ξy), according to Remark
2, then there is a ξD, such that M = Φ(ξy), and the PBE is(
z∗(ξ),KD∗
0 ,KD∗
1 (ξ);
(
f b, F b
))
=(
1{ξD≤ξ≤ξ̄}, u+ (T bξD )−1
(
w − c− ck
w − c
)
, u+ ξ +G−1
(
w − c− ck
w − c
)
; (fξD , FξD )
)
.
Finally, for M = 0, there is a PBE such that the retailer always adopts the
blockchain technology, that is we check the following decisions and belief satisfy
the conditions of PBE,
(
z∗(ξ),KD∗
0 ,KD∗
1 (ξ);
(
f b, F b
))
=(
1, u− ξ̄ +G−1
(
w − c− ck
w − c
)
, u+ ξ +G−1
(
w − c− ck
w − c
)
; 1{−ξ̄}
)
.
First, it’s easy to see that KD∗
0 and KD∗
1 (ξ) are the optimal equilibrium of the
supplier based on the retailer’s choice and belief 1{−ξ̄} (i.e., (f−ξ̄, F−ξ̄)). Hence,
we only need to show that the retailer will always adopt the blockchain technology
when the belief of the supplier is 1{−ξ̄}. That is, ΠA
r1 − ΠA
r0 ≥ 0 holds for all
ξy ∈ [−ξ̄, ξ̄]. Hence, according to R′ > 0, we have Eε
(
φ
(
ΠD
r1
)
− φ
(
ΠD
r0
))
= Eε
(
φ
(
(r − w)min
{
u+ ξ +G−1
(
w − c− ck
w − c
)
, u+ ξ + ε
})
− φ
(
(r − w)min
{
u− ξ̄ +G−1
(
w − c− ck
w − c
)
, u− ξ̄ + ε
}))
≥ 0
Then Remark 3 is proved.
Appendix H. Proof of Remark 4.
Proof. The i-th supplier decision the optmal component capacity KE∗
1i and KE∗
0i by
maximizing his profit, then we can obtain the optimal
KE∗
1i = ui + λiξ +G−1
i
(
w−c−ck
w−c
)
, KE∗
0i =
(
ui + (T bi)−1

/λi.
And the profit of the retailer with private demand information ξ is
ΠE
r1 =
n∑
i=1
(r − w)Eεi
(
min
{
KE∗
1i , ui + λiξ + εi

ΠE
r0 =
n∑
i=1
(r − w)Eεi
(
min
{

ξ.
Thus, the retailer adopts the blockchain technology if and only if
ΠE
r1 −ΠE
r0 =
n∑
i=1
(r − w)Eεi
(
min
{
KE∗

−M
−
n∑
i=1
(r − w)Eεi
(
min
{
KE∗

.
Note that, K∗0i is independent of ξ, we have
∂(ΠE

r0)
∂ξ
= (r − w)
(
n−
n∑
i=1
Gi
(
KE∗
0i − ui − λiξ
))
> 0
Then ΠE
r1 −ΠE
r0 is an increasing function. Thus, the retailer adopts the blockchain
technology if and only if ξ is larger than a certain threshold ξE .

.
Similar with the Proof of Lemma 4.2, we can prove that Ξ(ξy) is a positive function
and continuous on (−ξ̄, ξ̄]. Therefore, the proof of Remark 5 is similar with Remark
4.3, then we omit them.
