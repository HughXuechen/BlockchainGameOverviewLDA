Abstract
Purpose –The study is an attempt to exploremuch talked but less understood issue of “blockchain in logistics
industry” in modern perspective. The customers’ acceptance of blockchain technology in logistics and supply
chain is tested through “Technology Acceptance Model” by using attitude, perceived usefulness (PU),
perceived ease of use (PEOU), behavioral intention and use behavior.
Design/methodology/approach –Data has been collected through online and offline medium, where active
240 responses have been collected finally using convenience sampling. Confirmatory factor analysis with
structural equation modeling (SEM) was carried out for data analysis.
Findings – The customers’ acceptance of blockchain technology in logistics and supply chain is tested
through “Technology Acceptance Model.” The findings reveal model fit where PEOU, PU and attitude are the
major constructs of the model to realize the substantial gains in logistics process efficiency.
Research limitations/implications – Convenience sampling has been considered for the study to collect
the data of online users of various technology applications for tracking and shipment detail, whereas a more
specified method sampling can be considered for the future research. The study has been conducted in the
Indian context, which has been considered as the limitation pertaining to generalization across countries and
industries.
Practical implications – The findings of this study will be helpful for market practitioners to build
transparency between customers and industry to overcome the frictions in logistics. Blockchain will help in
monitoring the performance history and previous commitments of logistics professionals resulting in selecting
a responsible logistics solution provider. Access to critical data by the authorized member of the supply chain
will reduce unsubstantiated disputes.
Social implications – Blockchain technology will be available to everyone on the network. This will bring
transparency and help logistics professionals such as carriers, shippers and brokers to detect early frauds and
prevent thefts. It will increase customer trust toward any financial transaction for tracking the ownership of
titles.
Originality/value –Blockchain technology is envisioned to be a technology that could be a game-changer for
decentralizing infrastructure, introducing transparency and building trust in the supply chain. The current
study is a novel addition to the literature where blockchain technology enables the indisputable storage of
verified data that was previously kept in safeguarded silos.

1. Introduction
Innovation in digital finance, commonly called “Fintech,” is gaining attention from Silicon
Valley to Wall Street to Tokyo and even to developing countries such as India and China.
Blockchain is a distributed database that holds records of digital data or events in a way that
makes them tamper-resistant. By “sharing” databases between multiple parties, blockchain
basically removes the requirement for mediators who were hitherto indispensable to act as
trusted third parties to verify, record and coordinate transactions. Moving from centralized to
a decentralized and distributed system, blockchain efficiently liberates data that was
previously kept in safeguarded storage houses. It is estimated that seven out of 10 major
global companies are presently exploring ways in which they can apply blockchain
technology to their businesses. Walmart recently teamed up with IBM to increase
transparency in their supply chains. Then there is the Blockchain in Trucking Alliance
(BiTA), with over 60 members including FedEx, DHL, UPS, Visa and Uber Freight, to name a
few. One major advantage of blockchain is to create transparency and trust as every member
of the logistics network has access to the same data, offering a single point of truth (Tapscott
and Tapscott, 2016). Adoption of blockchain in the supply chain has the potential to
strengthen supply chain transparency and logistics effectiveness (Abeyratne and
Monfared, 2016).
It is not also surprising to some logistics experts that believe blockchain to have “hidden
enormous potential” (O’Marah, 2017), to be a real twenty-first century platform for economic
restoration (Casey and Wong, 2017) and to “transmute the entire supply chain and dislocate
the way we manufacture, market, procure, and consume our goods” (Dickson, 2016).
Collectively, blockchain might be nothing less than the “holy grail” (Popper and Lohr, 2017).
Conversely, what is natural with any emerging technology, the hype around blockchain
appears largely driven by technology benefactors, advisors and journalists. Logistics
operators, particularly small and medium-sized companies, proclaim to have bare minimum
knowledge about blockchain (Kersten et al., 2017). The claim can be described not only
through the innovation of the technology but also through the lack of convincing use cases
that clearly show blockchain’s benefit over existing IT solutions. Logistics and SCM research
on blockchain is still in its infancy (Zhao et al., 2016) and ought to look into possible
applications (Yli-Huumo et al., 2016). The implementation of the blockchain technology
solutions with the organization is difficult and lack of customer’s knowledge adds to this
challenge. Implementation of blockchain technology is like the orchestration of sustainable
practices with environmental regulations (Saberi et al., 2018).
There are a number of problems within the industry; including transparency in supply
chains with many end consumers not knowing where their products have come from,
complex processes with intermediary freight brokers and a lack of accountability when it
comes to losses that occur within the often complex and opaque process. Blockchain offers
numerous advantages for the supply chain sector. For instance, physical actions in silos can
be documented in a blockchain in the form of digital information, and multiple operations,
such as orders and payments, can be automatically arranged. After the release of Bitcoin in
2009, not only the business world but also entire educated lot became aware of blockchain
technology. Major strata still believe blockchain and cryptocurrency to be the same thing.
Therefore, negative sentiments against cryptocurrency sometimes tend to be transferred to
the blockchain technology discussion. The current study aims to understand the consumer
acceptance and adoption toward a new technology that will help in future to have more
security and transparency related to all type of transactions. With the help of blockchain
technology, the companies can save the cost by having efficient and automated processes.
After exploring the prospect use of blockchain technology in logistics, the current study has
been structured, and conceptual framework has been proposed in this studywhere fourmajor
determinants, that is, attitude, perceived ease of use (PEOU), perceived usefulness (PU) and
JEIM

behavioral intention, effect on the use behavior have been analyzed. Hence, the objective of
the study is as follow as:
(1) To understand the impact of various antecedents such as attitude, perceived ease of
use and perceived usefulness on behavioral intention vis-�a-vis behavioral intention
impact on use behavior toward the use of blockchain technology for product
information such as tracking detail and product counterfeit.
(2) To prove the aforementioned objective, TAM (technology acceptancemodel) has been
used with all the antecedents (Davis, 1993) to analyze the adoption intention toward
blockchain technology for product information such as tracking detail and product
counterfeit.
2. Literature review
Blockchain technology is emerging significantly across different domains such as health
care, fashion, retail, citizen services, automotive and manufacturing and energy. The
technology has an effect like a pebble in themarket and has created the ripples, in the ocean of
technology, in different domains outwardly including logistics also. Blockchain has the
potential to increase the business efficiency for the betterment of the logistics business
(K€uckelhaus et al., 2018). According to IDC report (2018), blockchain technology has huge
potential in future and expected to reach $9.7 billion by 2021 globally, vis-a-vis, logistics
industry will be considered as the top most customer for this change. It has been estimated
that distribution and services will have a market size approximately $1,000 million globally
with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 82 percent. Blockchain technology has
tremendous opportunities across industries and can be unfolded for the betterment of the
industry. Blockchain works as a digital ledger, which has all the details about the
transactions and the information for the same. It notifies about any transaction that happens
digitally, whereas the information about the parties will not be disclosed.
2.1 Use of blockchain technology in logistics: evidence from industry
The scope of blockchain technology is not limited to financial applications and
cryptocurrencies but has largely expended to other applications, such as Internet of
Things (IoT), smart contracts and smart properties (Mougayar, 2016). The logistics industry
in particular offers auspicious breakthroughs for upcoming business models (Deloite, 2017)
and started to advance traction from an increasing number of supply chain managers, who
study deploying blockchain technology (Bastian et al., 2018).
Imaginewhat if organizations could eliminate the necessity for intermediaries in theworld
of logistics? What if transactions could be recorded, verified and synchronized separately
without involving third parties? If this happens, it would drastically eliminate awhole layer of
complication from present global supply chains (Ari Sivula et al., 2018). This is the promising
feature that blockchain offers to the logistics industry. Chronicled[1] combines blockchain
with Artificial Intelligence and IoT devices to automate traceability and promptly approve
financial transactions in the shipping industry. Chronicled’s blockchain-enabled IoT-based
devices provide logistics companies enhanced understandings into environmental conditions
and transfer-of-custody processes. Consequently, organizations can efficiently and prudently
move their products all over the world.
Similarly, SkyCell[2] offers specially designed temperature-controlled container
solutions to pharma industry by protecting the most sensitive medicines, drugs and
injections. SkyCell has placed its entire infrastructure in a decentralized blockchain
platform. SkyCell believes that this is achieved through their unique amalgamation of
hardware, software and service, which made them unbeatable by mastering logistical

challenges and eliminating temperature excursion. In less than a period of two years, it has
emerged as one of the global commercial blockchain alliances that collectively generate
more than $1 trillion annual revenues.
Similarly, UK-based Provenance uses blockchain to increase transparency in the retail
sector. For providing better business practices, Provenance retailers document the
origination of their foodstuffs and display their supply chains on a ledger. Provenance’s
objective for applying blockchain is to hold retailers accountable while helping members
make higher-quality, more trustable products.
Blockchain technology is particularly adept at simplifying complex and fragmented
processes – like those that are commonly foundwithin the logistics and supply chain industry
(Table I). Blockchain technology records transactions, tracks assets and creates a transparent
and efficient system for managing all documents involved in the logistics process.

The main drawback that traditional
supply chain faces is the lack of trust-
based information. Blockchain and IoT
offer portable solutions brought to
complex structures.
Sharing an exclusive blockchain across the
different stakeholders of the supply chain
(consumer, freight and production) ensures
that the exchanged and manipulated
wares are authenticated, thus preventing
potential fraud and making information
accessible.

trick or treat?
Adoption of blockchain technology in the
traditional supply chain enhances overall
efficiency and gives positive impact on the
various areas of the logistics industry such
as wagon transportation, intercontinental
transportation (air and ocean), supply
chainmanagement and shipment tracking.
Though blockchain is entirely a new
technology, it continues to revolutionize
the future of logistics, permitting for a
more precise in-transit visibility and
delivery of goods.

(2019)
Blockchain start-ups in the logistics
industry: the technology’s potential to
disrupt business models and supply
chains
Applications of blockchain in supply chain
can be grouped into five use-case clusters.
Dominant use cases cover provenance
tracing of assets as well as automation of
supply chain operations while aspects of
supply chain finance are only supported
occasionally in blockchain applications.
Virtual on-demand supply chain will form
the next revolutionary step of blockchain
technology in supply chain management
and logistics, which coincides with the
ongoing service transformation of the
industrial sector.

Use of blockchain in logistics operations
offers the possibility for (data related)
products and or services that are
inexpensive, quicker and more safe than
existing technologies.
With blockchain technology, current
market frictions can be overwhelmed by
producing peer-to-peer networks in many
senses.
The finding depicts that existing business
practices and models are prone to this
innovation.

2.2 Theoretical foundation
2.2.1 Technology acceptance model. Lack of technical knowledge or may be less interest in
using new technology can be considered as the key reason of not adopting the new
technology. There are factors that have been observed as the key challenges in the process of
adaptation such as unavailability of good technical resources to develop user-friendly
blockchain tool (Mougayar, 2016). Accepting a new technology and adopting the same as a
part of daily routine process is a long-term process, wherein, each individual will perceive in
its own way (Jharkharia and Shankar 2005; Swan, 2015; Mougayar, 2016; Kumar et al., 2018;
Jain and Singh, 2016). TAM (Davis, 1993); (Davis et al., 1989) posited that there are two major
dimensions, that is, PU and PEOU, that have been used to predict the attitude of an individual
while using a new technology platform. These two constructs are most important while
understanding the attitude of an individual toward a new technology adopted for business
perspective. The said dimensions of TAM have been used in the TAM as an external
indicator to determine the effect of these dimensions on the attitude and behavioral intentions
of an individual toward using a new technology. There are various studies that have analyzed
the two major dimensions, that is, PEOU and PU, to understand the TAM application in the
market scenario. PEOU and PU have been used as the two major dimensions based on TAM
to understand the attitude of an individual toward using new technology (Pavlou, 2003);
(Gefen et al., 2003; Lee and Chen, 2019; Valaei et al., 2019). TAM has been adopted in various
studies as well to determine the acceptance of new technology by a user. TAM is an ideal
method to determine the acceptance of new technology and has been determined.
2.2.1.1 Attitude. According to theory of reasoned action (TRA) (Ajzen and Fishbein, 1980;
Davis, 1993), attitude of an individual plays an important role toward understanding the
effect of new technology on an individual’s behavioral belief. Attitude is considered as an
important variable while understanding the intention and desire of an individual in terms of
using the technology. This construct helps in understanding the intentions of an individual as
one of important constructs of TAMwhere understanding the acceptance of an individual is
the primary success factor and considered as an important aspect as well. As a part of TAM
(Davis, 1993), behavioral intentions have been considered as another important construct to
understand an individual’s intention toward using a new technology
2.2.1.2 Perceived ease of use. PEOU plays a big role in terms of understanding an
individual’s feeling of ease of using the technology for various purposes. PEOU is an
important antecedent of TAM to understand the acceptance of an individual of using a new
technology. It is an important antecedent, while determining the impact and behavioral
intentions of an individual in terms of using a new technology though this construct will not
be able to determine the impact of the technology on an individual’s behavior directly, but it
will work as an important antecedent in predicting the same behavior due to change in
technology. In the age of petabyte, where technology has a lot of importance in the life of an
individual, contribution of TAM has its own importance for a researcher in determining the
impact of new technology on the attitude and intentions of an individual. Technology plays a
major role for an individual in terms of providing different features and functions, whether
the importance of technologywill be related to hedonic or utilitarian feature, still the presence
of technology will remain there for an individual and impact too. PEOU is an important
antecedent of TAM, which shows the effortless intentions of an individual toward using a
new technology and also shows the extent towhich the new technologywill be having an ease
in the life of human being (Davis et al., 1989). Though, at the surface level, the purpose of using
the technology will remain same, still the improvement in terms of having better features and
easewill make the acceptance of new technology of an individual a lotmore important. In case
of blockchain technology, PEOUworks as an antecedent of TAM to understand the provided
feature of transparency in information while getting the information of product in terms of
logistics operations
JEIM

2.2.1.3 Perceived usefulness. PU is another important antecedent of TAM and determines
the extent to which an individual would consider himself in terms enhancing the knowledge
and skills in using a new technology ((Davis et al., 1989). It determines the degree of an
individual’s belief about the usefulness of new technology. TAM has posited the two major
antecedents in the model that play an important role in describing the impact of these two
constructs on the attitude and intentions toward using a new technology. As per the previous
studies, which have considered TAM, perceptions in terms of usefulness and ease of use have
a lot of impact on an individual toward using a new technology platform and using the same
for further application purpose. As per the findings of these studies, there is a correlation
between PU and intention to use, which is positive in nature, whereas the relationship
between PU and attitude is comparatively weak in nature (Davis et al., 1989); (Jackson et al.,
1997) and (Lucas et al., 1999).
3. Development of the conceptual framework
The aim of the study is to understand the adaptation and acceptance of user toward using
a new technology. After reviewing various papers and research articles, it has been
analyzed that the requirement of the current study is need of the current market situation
for the benefit of the market practitioners and academicians. There are various factors of
TAM related to attitude, PEOU and PU, which have a lot of impact on the behavior
intention of use of technology. To understand the acceptance of user, structural equation
modeling (SEM) has been used in the current study (given in Figure 1). According to a
study performed by Bollen (1989), various relationship networks have been derived based
on theory by using statistical methodologies such as SEM. In the current study, the
analysis for the study has been performed in two steps. Primarily, confirmatory factor
analysis (CFA) has been performed for the current study to analyze the influence of these
major determinant factors on the user behavioral intention and actual behavior; then SEM
has been performed to analyze the model fit of the conceptual model with the theoretical
model (given in Figure 2).
3.1 Model testing
The current study is an effort to determine the model fit between conceptual framework and
TAM. Though there have been different previous studies where the model fit methods have
been used to understand the adaptation of proven theoretical model in the current business
scenario (Jain et al., 2018a; Jain et al., 2018b). With the advent of technology, it has been
observed that technology is changing spontaneously in the current business scenario. This
change has been accepted by customers in a positive way, which has been determined and
proven by various studies by using theoretical model of TAM by using its three major
constructs such as PEOU, PU and attitude. The model fit will show the effect of these
constructs on the consumer intention to use new technology in a positive way or negative one.
To prove the said relationships, all the items have been analyzed for threemajor determinants

4. Research methodology
4.1 Sample design
The current study is analyzing the acceptance of new technology by user with the help of
TAM, which has been given by (Davis et al., 1989) with special reference to logistics industry.
The current study has respondents from varied demographic profiles such as 18–40 years of
age respondents specifically who are using different modes of technology to track the status
of shipment and financial transaction while doing the online shopping within 4–5 months
online. There are 250 active online shoppers selected as respondents on the basis of previous
online purchase using electronic media, and they are also using different platforms to shop
online such as mobile application, electronic shopping, Instagram, Facebook and mobile
commerce. Out of 250 sample size, 240 responses have been used finally to analyze due to the
nonavailability of some responses for some factors. Though the respondents have no
experience of blockchain technology previously, they have familiarity with various mobile
applications in their daily routine.
The demographic analysis of the study is as follows (given in Table II):
4.2 Hypothesis
The current research focuses on the following hypothesis:
H1. User’s attitude is positively related to the behavioral intention of using blockchain
technology in logistics industry with special reference to product information such
as tracking detail and product counterfeit.
H2. Perceived ease of use is positively related to behavioral intention of using blockchain
technology in logistics industry with special reference to product information such
as tracking detail and product counterfeit.
H3. Perceived usefulness is positively related to behavioral intention of using blockchain
technology in logistics industry with special reference to product information such
as tracking detail and product counterfeit.
 
At primary stage, the literature review has been done based on industry-
specific keywords
In this stage, data collection has been performed to collect the responses from
respondents on various constructs like attitude, PEOU, PU, behavioral intention
and actual behavior

H4. Behavioral intention to use is positively related to actual behavior of blockchain
technology in logistics industry with special reference to product information such
as tracking detail and product counterfeit.
4.3 Research instruments
A questionnaire has been designed to measure three major determinants, that is, attitude,
PEOU, PU, behavioral intention to use and actual behavioral. There are 15 items used in the
current study to analyze the influence and perform the model fit analysis. In the
questionnaire, 15 items have been developed on Likert scale to understand the acceptance
of use toward the new technology, that is, blockchain technology. These items have been
developed for five major categories of factors, that is, attitude, PEOU, PU, behavior intention
and actual use behavior.
5. Results
The reliability coefficient of all the 15 items have been developed on Likert scale to test the
stated hypotheses and prove the proposed conceptual framework, goodness of fit test,
reliability, convergent and discriminant validity have been used in the study to test the
hypotheses.
The cronbach alpha value for the 15 items proves the reliability test (Hair, 2007) provided
in Table III.
5.1 Confirmatory factor analysis
In the current study, based on conceptual model, there are three exogenous variables and
two endogenous variables. To perform the analysis and result findings, CFA has been
used to find the effect of observed variables. In the conceptual model, there are three
exogenous variables (attitude, PEOU, PU) and two endogenous variables (behavior

intention and actual behavior to use). Behavioral intention to use has been used as a
mediating variable, which has been used to prove the relationship and connection between
actual behavior as endogenous variable and attitude, PEOU and PU as exogenous
variables. It has been posited that the estimated value of regression observed variable
above 0.3 is considered to be normal in nature and above 0.5 is considered to be healthy
(Hair, 2007). All the items, which have been the part of analysis, have been validated and
fulfill the validity test requirement.
Finally, out of 15 items, only 12 items have been considered for the final analysis (provided
in Table IV). As from the measurement model indices, it is clear that 12 items have the high
value of indices for four major factors, which have been underlying factors of TAM. The
loading values of these factors are proving the relationship with the underlying factors as
per TAM.
5.2 Measurement model
All the constructs have been measured based on the measurement model (provided in
Figure 3) and have been analyzed also. To find the model fit, various constructs have been
analyzed on the basis of model. With the help of CFA, the relationship between all the
constructs has been analyzed on the basis of conceptual model of the study. Further, to find
the model fit, the findings of the CFA have been analyzed based on the postulated theory and
have been compared also to determine the model fit (given in Table V).

the model fit of study in the current scenario.
5.4 Structural model
In the process of testing model fit (given in Table VI), performing SEM analysis (given in
Figure 4) is the next step while doing the measurement model validity. The conceptual model
of the current study has been designed on the basis of TAM.
5.5 Estimated standardized path coefficients
The standardized path coefficients should be significant in nature to fulfill the primary
requirement of model fit and it’s the primary requirement of the SEM analysis. As per the
Table VII, all the constructs are significant in nature.
Hypothetical relationships between constructs, which have been conceptualized in this
paper, are found to be significant in nature and fulfilling the theorized model fit indices and
value of indices are also under the permissible and acceptable range.

5.6 Summary of findings
The analysis has been performed to test the proposed model and its hypothesis as per the
designed structure of the model. The analysis has been performed in two steps, that is, first
step is to perform CFA and then SEM in the second step.
Step 1: Result analysis of confirmatory factor analysis
In the first step, CFA has been performed to assess the discriminant and convergent validity
of constructs, that is, attitude, PEOU, PU, behavioral intention and actual behavior. To
analyze the result, AMOS 19 software has been used to test the path diagrams for all the
constructs and their observed variables. The hypothesis testing has been performed and
checked by using different parameters such as Chi-square, goodness of fit index (GFI),
adjusted goodness of fit index (AGFI), comparative fit index (CFI) and root mean square of
approximation (RMSEA) with their range of acceptance, that is, 0.9, 0.8, 0.9 and 0.08,
respectively (Gefen et al., 2003). The acceptable range of the RMSEA should be less than
0.08 for good fit; however, if the value of the index is less than 0.05, then it’s an excellent fit
(Browne and Curdeck, 1993).
To prove the hypothesis, latent constructs have been analyzed for two major parameters,
that is, convergent validity and discriminant validity. The factor loadings of all the constructs
have been measured to prove the strength of the relationship and the acceptable range of the
factor loading has been considered above 0.5. There are in total 12 items that have been
extracted finally out of 15 factors. These 12 factors have loading value above 0.5, whereas the
other three factors have low factor loading. The model has 0.074 value of RMSEA, which
proves the primary index of model fit and has a good fit (Browne and Curdeck, 1993).
Step 2: Result analysis of structural equation modeling
After the analysis, it has been proved that observed data fits based on the measurement and
structural equations as per conceptual model. The values of the model fit indexes have been
validated and analyzed to prove the relationship as per conceptual model. The values of all
the indexes are falling under the permissible range of acceptance and it proves the model fit.
The process of validation ofmodel fit has been analyzed in two steps: factor analysis has been
performed in the first to validate the theorized model and SEM analysis has been performed
in the second step to test the hypothetical relationship.
6. Discussion
The result and findings of the study prove the relationship of the underlying constructs of the
posited model, which has been used to find the acceptance of the blockchain technology. The
respondents have given their feedback on the basis of items that have been constructed on the
basis of previous studies. The findings prove that PEOU, PU and attitude are having strong
relationship with behavioral intentions to use the new technology as compared to having low
relationship with actual behavior, whereas behavioral intention also shows positive
relationship with actual behavior to use new technology. So, the analysis proved that PEOU,

PU and attitude for customers are the dominance factors for considering the new technology
advantage over the traditional method of technology. It also reflects that customers consider
this technologymaking their life easy and the available information and content online isworth
to give ease to customers. With the advent of technology, customers are accessing information
and shift to a better technology with a fraction of second. As per findings of the analysis,
blockchain has high impact on the consumers and moving at a high pace, though earlier the
technology has been used in different industries at a snail’s pace. Blockchain technology will
hasten the process of trust and transparency among customers. It has been observed that
customers show PU and PEOU as the major indicating factors toward accepting technology.
The values of estimated coefficients for all the standardized items, which fall under the
permissible range of significance in nature, prove the relationship among various constructs
and values signify the model fit (see Figure 3 and 4).
Now imagine the likelihood of easily tracking products from the material that was used to
create it, to its purchase in a store or on a website. What would it mean for consumers? With
the help of smart phones, by scanning a tag on their trouser or shirt or any other item, they
will know the authenticity of the product they are planning to buy.Where it wasmade, which
raw material was used, information will be in their hands, resulting in transparency and
traceability. Customers will decide themselves which product to buy with enhanced
confidence. This will leave no space for copying and making duplicate goods as blockchain
will enable brands to hold and control the data they provide both out to their employees and
outside world. This will also enable customers to know and understand the complexity in
bringing a new technology in the market.
7. Implications from the study
7.1 Theoretical implications
The current study has huge contribution in the literature towards the use of blockchain
technology in logistics industry. In this research, the special focus has been given to
understand the adoption intention of blockchain technology in logistics industry with special
reference to product information like tracking detail and product counterfeit. Various past
studies (Grover et al., 2019; Tijan et al., 2019; Poszler et al., 2019; Gregor et al., 2019; Singh et al.,
2019) have examined the use of blockchain technology but, the current has measured all the
aspects by considering the constructs of technology adoption model (TAM) (Davis, 1993;
Davis et al., 1989). There are three exogenous variables like attitude, perceived ease of use and
perceived usefulness vis-�a-vis two endogenous variables like adoption intention and actual
behavior to use the technology have been studied which provides deep insights about the use
of blockchain technology.
7.2 Implications of blockchain on business revenues
Using blockchain in logistics will result in enhanced business revenues and better customer
relations. The major limitation of the current study is that a generalized approach has been
considered for the study instead of some specific variables. Convenience sampling has been
considered for the study to collect the data of online users of various technology applications
for tracking and shipment detail, whereas a more specified method sampling has been
considered for the future research as compared to convenience. Convenience sampling may
show the biased results while performing the analysis for the study. A future study for
academicians would be related to find the acceptance of new technology based on age,
profession and usability.
8. Conclusion, limitation and future research
The global logistics industry is increasingly relying on upcoming technology to cut costs,
improve processes and enhance transparency. Blockchain technology could be a solution to
JEIM

many of such logistics issues. In this study, we have performed the analysis and postulated
hypothesis, which has been structured on the basis of theorized model described in the
literature review. Various constructs of the TAM have been analyzed to check the model fit
between conceptual model and theorized model. Three major dimensions, attitude, PU and
PEOU, have been analyzed to determine the effect of these dimensions on the behavioral
intentions and actual behavior of an individual toward using a new technology (Davis et al.,
1989). The findings of the study advocate that the theory of TAM (Davis et al., 1989), attitude,
PEOU and PU have direct impact on the online consumer behavioral intentions to use toward
using a new technology; vis-�a-vis behavioral intentions have the direct impact on actual
behavior of using the technology. This proves the relationship of the underlying constructs of
the postulated model, which has been used to find the acceptance of the blockchain
technology in logistics.
Academicians can also look further at the effect of various promotions done by
microcelebrities on consumer’s purchase intention.
From a logistics perspective, there are numerous applications that could benefit from the
tie-up of blockchain and logistics. The prominent among them are expected as follows:
(1) Blockchain will help in monitoring the performance history and previous
commitments of logistics professionals resulting in selecting a responsible logistics
solution provider.
(2) Access to critical data by the authorized member of the supply chain will reduce
unsubstantiated disputes.
(3) Blockchain and ELDs (electronic logging devices) are a perfect match as ELDs can
send a stream of driver behavior and route data to a blockchain in real time. Pairing
this information with traffic data and weather data will provide logistics
professionals a tool to improve real-time routing.
(4) Last but not the least, every transaction taken through blockchain will be readily
available to everyone on the network. This will bring transparency and help logistics
professionals such as carriers, shippers and brokers to detect early frauds and
prevent thefts.
