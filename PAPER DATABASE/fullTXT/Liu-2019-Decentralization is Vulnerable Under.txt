ABSTRACT The blockchain is the core mechanism of Bitcoin, which is mainly enabled by a distributed
consensus mechanism. Essentially, in Proof-of-Work-based consensus protocol, the miners generate a series
of blocks to realize decentralization practical. Miners receive two types of revenue: block rewards and
transaction fees, in which the reward of block drops off as time goes on. Carlsten et al. defined a mining gap
and then Tsabary et al. analyzed the gap game exploring howmining gaps form. In this paper, we analyze the
other implications of the gap game. First, it is well known that the security of Bitcoin decentralized consensus
protocol relies on miners behaving correctly. The security of the blockchain system will be threatened in
case of the consensus mechanism is breached. Therefore, we also described how the gap game impacts the
decentralization of Bitcoin and the stability of blockchain. Second, to confirm the implication, we discuss
what aspects of decentralization can be impacted by the gap game; then we defined a new decentralization
model and listed its main features. In the end, we analyze the block reward capacity in the blockchain and
consider the impact on the existing two common block reward systems when the gap game was formed.

I. INTRODUCTION
The Bitcoin, proposed by Nakamoto et al. [1], realized a
monetary system without relying on any third trusted cen-
tral authority, has been obtaining increasing popularity and
acceptance by a wider community. One reason for Bitcoin
far-ranging adoption is that a low-cost, decentralized cur-
rency is inherently independent of governments and any cen-
tral authorities.
The blockchain is the core mechanism for the Bitcoin.
It relies, among other things, on a network of computers that
synchronous transactions with a process called mining. Min-
ers collect transactions and append them to the blockchain,
forming a globally-agreed ledger. Instead of relying on a third
trusted central authority, the most famous blockchain-based
Bitcoin [1]–[3] relies on incentives to ensure security. It uses

Proof-of-Work (PoW) [1], [4], [5], requiring participants to
solve a difficult computing problem that is hard to solve but
easy to verify. The miners who can work out this problem has
the right to create a new block.
Systems that use proof of work rely on the assumption
that at least 50% of computational work invested in mining
is by honest participants [1]. To stimulate miner’s participa-
tion, this cryptocurrency system provides them with block
rewards. In addition, the miners who created a new block can
also get transactions fees, paid from handling transactions.
This system is designed to ensure participants to follow the
protocol rules, and if they don’t obey this rule, their profit will
be decreased.
When we talked about the Bitcoin is a decentralized sys-
tem,we have mentioned that the Bitcoin uses a proof of
work scheme as It’s block generation strategy to realize
the control of the block, and thus renders decentralization
practical [6], [7]. The use of proof of work to eliminate the

central party and to decentralize and secure ledger. However,
this is not always the case for the Bitcoin System. Some
prior works show that the vital operations and decisions that
Bitcoin is currently undertaking are not decentralized [8], [9].
On the one hand, mining and block creation is currently
largely centralized. On the other hand, other Bitcoin opera-
tions, like protocol updates and event handling are controlled
by a small number of administrators whose influence depend
on their function within the system.
The security of Bitcoin decentralized consensus protocol
relies more upon miners behaving correctly. If they obey the
rules, they will get mining revenues under the assumption
that they are rational. Miners can receive two types of rev-
enue: block rewards and transaction fees. The former rewards
for the large majority of miner revenues now, but in the
future, it is expected to transition to the latter as the block
rewards decreased (it’s halved every four years). There has
been an implied belief that whether miners are paid by block
rewards or transaction fees does not affect the security of the
blockchain. In [10], they show that this belief is not correct.
They analyzed if without a block reward, immediately after
a block is found there is zero expected reward for mining but
nonzero electricity cost, making it unprofitable for any miner
to mine. This phenomenon is called mining gap. Explicitly,
this would have a negative impact on Bitcoin security. This is
due to the effective hash power in the network would decline,
and it would become easier for a malicious miner to fork.
In [11], they defined and analyzed the gap game exploring
how mining gaps form as a function of subsidy and fees, they
also use EBRR denote the ratio of the expected base reward
and the expected accumulated fees, and show that EBRR ≈
6 is sufficient to avoid mining gaps in presented scenarios,
indeed, they show that gaps formwell before fees are the only
incentive. Then they analyzed the implications on security.
Surprisingly, we also discover the formation of gap game
reduces the decentralization of Bitcoin.
We consider our main contributions to be the following.
1) Firstly, to our best knowledge, there are hardly
any researches in decentralization model. Therefore,
to confirm our implication that the formation of the
gap game threatens the decentralization of Bitcoin,
we defined a new decentralization model and listed
its main features. They represent three levels of the
decentralized model: fairness, liveness, and security.
2) Secondly, We depicted the mining model and gap game
to describe the possible behaviors of Bitcoin users and
miners when the gap game of Bitcoin is formed. That
is, as the reward of the entire Bitcoin shift from block
rewards to transaction fees, the miners and users in
Bitcoin will engage in those behaviors. With the effects
of these behaviors on the decentralization system that
are also analyzed. Afterward, we discuss what aspects
of decentralization can be impacted by the gap game.
And then we also analyzed the impact of the formation
of gap game on the security of the Bitcoin system and
the stability of the blockchain structure.
3) In the end, we analyze the block reward capacity in the
blockchain and consider the impact on the existing two
common block reward systems when the gap game was
formed.
We proceed as follows: after introducing the relevant work
(Section 2), we propose our decentralization model and min-
ing model (Section 3 and Section 4). Then, we analyze
how the formation of gap game impacted on decentralization
model of Bitcoin. In particular, we consider the behavior
of miners and users when the gap game is formed. And
other influences on Bitcoin security and blockchain stability
(Section 5). And blockchain reward capacity (Section 6),
mainly considered two reward systems about themining pool.
We then give some evaluations about the formation of gap
game (Section 7). In the end, we come to some conclusions
(Section 8).
II. RELATED WORK
In recent years, a number of models to issue the block reward
have been proposed. At the beginning of white paper [1],
the composition of reward is simply explained, and the idea
of incentives is presented intuitional. Eyal and Sirer [12]
show an abnormal mining strategy named selfish mining,
by which an attacker increases her relative reward. Sapir-
shtein et al. [13] both show more complicated variations of
the original selfish mining attack that increase the attacker s
reward when applied.
Other work by [14] shows mining pools are incentivized to
allocate some of their mining rigs to sneak on other mining
pools. It also concludes that an equilibrium exists were two
pools steak on one another, in which they both end up losing
compared to the situation if they did not attack at the begin-
ning. In [15], they combine selfish mining with infiltration
attack. All of the above works we illustrated, they all consider
a model that block reward are the main incentives for the
miner to mine. However, the expenses are not considered at
all. In our work, we take into account not only the reward
the miners will receive but also the expenses they spend in
mining. We define a different mining model in which the
miner’s expenses is determined by different mining strategies
that miners use.
The work by Babaioff et al. [16] discuss incentives for
generation transactions in a cryptocurrency network. They
analyze several reward schemes to incentivize participants to
distribute transactions in the network. Moser and Bohme [17]
review and analyze the history of transaction fees in Bitcoin.
In our work, we analyze a reward scheme where participants
can get rewards for mining with non-negligible expenses.
In [10], they analyze Bitcoinwith no block reward and only
incentivized by transactions fees, in a model where the block
capacity is limitless. In this model, there are no remainder
fees after the new block is generated. Not only that, they
improved selfish mining and showed a new version that was
more suited to the transaction fee as the main incentives.
In their work, they propose a hypothesis called the formation
of the mining gap. The mining gap is a period of time when
91000 VOLUME 7, 2019
Y. Liu et al.: Decentralization is Vulnerable Under the Gap Game
miners shut down mining rigs to reduce mining expenses.
When such mining gap exists, the mining power utilization
of the network is sub-optimal.
In [11], they present a model to analyze miners’ profits
and use it to show that mining gaps do form. Their model
holds for both bounded and unbounded blocks, as well as
for combinations of subsidy and fees as part of the block
reward. They present a model that is in a quasi-static state.
That means no miners join or leave, existing miners maintain
their behavior and the system reached equilibrium. They also
conclude by showing that with sufficient initial block reward,
all miners are incentivized to resort to the default mining
strategy. However, this work using a quasi-static state to
quantify parameters. This is dependable since the parameter
of Bitcoin is changing all the time. In our work, we analyze a
dynamic state and we also show that rational miners will form
coalitions to increase their profits, result in decentralization
is being attacked.
Adem et al. [8] analyze decentralization in Bitcoin and
Enthereum. They provide new tools and techniques for mea-
suring blockchain-based cryptocurrency networks. What’s
more, they perform a comparative study of decentralization
metrics in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Arthur et al. [9] show that
the vital operations and decisions that Bitcoin is currently
undertaking are not decentralized. And they explore possible
solutions and recommendations to enhance the decentraliza-
tion in Bitcoin. In our work, we propose a decentralized
model that suits our mining model. Then we study the rela-
tionship between gap game and decentralization. Meni [18]
describe the various reward systems used to calculate rewards
of participants in Bitcoin mining pools.
III. DECENTRALIZATION MODEL
In the traditional centralized transaction system, each trans-
action must be verified by a central trusted institution (e.g.,
the central bank), which inevitably leads to the cost perfor-
mance bottleneck of the central server. In a Bitcoin decen-
tralized system, the payment process is completed through
Bitcoin transfer Bitcoin coins (BTCs) to generate transactions
between each participant.
The Bitcoin block contains several transactions. These
transactions are broadcast all over the blockchain network.
To prevent double-spending attacks in Bitcoin, Bitcoin uses a
proof-of-workmechanism (PoW) [1], [4], [5]to generate new
blocks. Specifically, participants must find a value to solve
a difficult computing problem [1]. If this problem can be
solved, this participant has the right to generate a new block.
The new block is then broadcast to the network and other
participants can verify the validation of the block as well
as those contained transactions. On successfully generating
a new block, participants currently receive a certain amount
of BTCs and transaction fees included in the block. This
motivates participants to keep the Bitcoin running well. The
newly created block will be forwarded to all participants in
the Bitcoin network, and the remaining participants can check
its correctness by verifying the hash computation. If the newly
generated block passes validation, the participants attach the
new block to the previously generated block.
The initial design goal of the Bitcoin is to make the
transaction generation and confirmation process completely
decentralized. However, operations at Bitcoin will only work
in practice if the majority of the computing power in the
network recognizes the decisions made in the Bitcoin. But in
fact, participants with more computing power in the Bitcoin
control the currency.
We conclude the factors of the decentralization [8] system.
Here we list three features of the decentralization model.
1) Fairness
Mining in a Bitcoin network is a complex process
that typically requires strong computing power. Nev-
ertheless, so long as there are many different groups
mining in the Bitcoin, the whole system remains decen-
tralized. For a decentralized system, participants should
join or leave the system unaffected by external factors.
In other words, Participants voluntarily enter or exit
the decentralized system. If none of the participants
wanted to form a decentralized system, there would
be no decentralized system. So the willingness of the
participants is very important.
Therefore, in a decentralized Bitcoin system, par-
ticipants who would like to start a new mining activ-
ity must have enough incentives to participant mining
work and join any pools that he likes. And not only that,
miners who are already involved in mining pools can
also stop at any time if they don’t want to continue for
some reason.
2) Liveness
We use fairness to describe voluntary action of min-
ers to join or leave the pool. As for decentralized sys-
tems, once a participant enters the system, he has the
right to vote on the decisions of the system. Not only
that, but participantsmust ensure that their votes are fair
and reasonable. Now we consider that when the miners
enter the pool, they have the right to vote as part of the
pool and they must ensure that the results of the voting
are fair and impartial. Only if the miners abide by the
rules and correctly use their right to vote can the pools
be maintained.
3) Security
In a decentralized system, if some malicious actors
want to control the whole system, the system must
ensure that the decisions of these malicious actors are
not adopted. We call this feature is security. In some
scenarios, the developer must take action on issues that
may cause conflict. In addition, the process must be
completely transparent and subject to strict supervi-
sion. So in the Bitcoin, participants must promise to
make transparent decisions.
In other words, if there are some malicious min-
ers who want to change the honest miner’s decision,
such behavior is unlikely to succeed. Only in this way,
the whole Bitcoin will becomemore secure. As a result,
VOLUME 7, 2019 91001
Y. Liu et al.: Decentralization is Vulnerable Under the Gap Game
the situation for malicious miners in the Bitcoin will
become tougher, and they can hardly change Bitcoin’s
decision.
In this section, We summarize three main characteristics
of a decentralized system. Fairness describes the freedom
of participants to enter and exit a decentralized system. For
the Bitcoin system, miners join or leave the pool to follow
their own will. Liveness describes the state of a participant
after he enters the decentralized system. When he enters
the decentralized system, he possesses the right to vote on
the events of the system. Moreover, he must guarantee the
fairness and impartiality of his voting results. For the Bitcoin
system, once a miner comes to the pool, he has the right to
vote on decisions made inside the pool, and he has to make
sure that his voting result is correct. Security also describes
a feature within a decentralized system. In a decentralized
system, this is not possible if there are malicious actors who
want to try to change the decision of the entire system. As for
the Bitcoin system, if a malicious miner wants to change the
voting decision of the entire Bitcoin system, the decentralized
system must ensure that the idea of the malicious miner
cannot be realized. Only when a system satisfies the above
three properties can it be called a decentralized system.
For any adversary A with less than ε power, then:
1− Pr
 LA
accept
−→ LS(i) : S(i)← S ∧
power(LS(i)) > power(LA) ∧
decision(S)
unchange
←− A
 ≤ f (ε) (1)
where f (ε) is a function depends on adversary’s power and it
decreases sharply when ε decreases.
Naturally, a decentralization system should be fair, live
and secure. The definition of the decentralization system
is straightforward: As showed in Fig 1. We use L denotes
decentralization, S for the set of all the miners, S(i) for the
subset of all the miners, andA for all the possible adversaries.
So the above inequalities (1) says that the probability of all
events that do not satisfy the decentralized behavior is not
exceeding f (ε). Event 1 means that if a subset S(i) is selected
from any set of miners, as long as the subset satisfies the
three characteristics mentioned above, then The decentralized
system will accept this subset of miners. Event 2 shows that
the voting power of the set of any adversaries LA is less than
that the power of subset of miners. Event 3 indicates that any
set of adversaries want to change the voting result is impossi-
ble. If the probability of all events that affect decentralization
is less than f (ε), we can call this system is a decentralized
system.
IV. THE MINING MODEL
We introduce a mining model [11] that we use throughout
our rest work to describe Bitcoin mining process. Therefore,
the model is composed of a number of miners and a number
of mining rigs. Every miner have a number of mining rigs and
control at least one rig and one rig is only controlled by one
miner.
Every rig has two states: off and on. Each miner allocates
a start time to each rig, on which the rig is opened. In case
of a rig is opened, the time for finding a valid block in
proportion to the hashing power rate of the rig, among all
mining rigs [1], [12], [13], [19]. As a consequence, the time
to find the first block is the smallest time of all different rigs
finding time. Since the value of the difficulty parameter and
the block time interval is also a constant value determined by
the system. The difficulty parameter indicates the difficulty
of the hard computing problem. The value of the difficulty
parameter is influenced by the miner’s open time of specified
rig. If the newly generated block founded time is too fast
or slow, the agreement will adjust the difficulty parameter
to make the block interval time as suitable as before. The
block reward of miners is controlled by the rigs which first
find a new block. The block reward consists of two parts.
The first part that is transaction fees that we showed before.
This part of the reward is determined by time. As the number
of transactions in the Bitcoin increases, the rewards for this
segment will continue to increase. The second part is the
block reward. Especially, only the miners controlled rigs that
find the block would get the reward, and the rest of the miners
are not rewarded.
The miners involved in the Bitcoin will incur some
expenses. These expenses can be divided into two forms [11].
One is capital expenses (capex) that miners who are owing
rigs must spend whether the rig off or on. The other is
operational expenses (opex) which miners are paid for having
rigs mining. Particular, these fees will be paid regardless of
whether the miners succeed in mining new blocks. In Bitcoin,
the process of generating blocks is always going. When a
new block is founded, all miners will go to look for the next
one. The difference value between a miner’s income and his
expenditure is his gain. They will make efforts to increase
their earnings if the miners are rational.
V. THE GAP GAME AND ANALYSIS
In [11], they formed a game could be formalized before the
block reward goes down to 0, that is, the gap game. The
strategy of players’ is to select the start time of all their
rigs. All players can choose the start time first. We define
a participant’s earning as his expected income, that is, his
expected income minus his expected expenses. In this model,
the system is composed of k rigs controlled by n players. Note
that turning rigs down is irrational behavior. This means that
the probability that the rig will find the block at some interval
is not affected by how long it has taken the miner to start
mining. Thus, the chance of a single rig finding a block does
not decrease over time. Not only that, but the block rewards
also increase over time.
The parameter values are affected by lots of factors,
affected by different resources. The fees are influenced by
system participants andmarket state [17]. The block reward is
also affected by market state and system participants. Indeed,
it is also affected by mining rate which depends on the
protocol in the system. Capex is influenced by factors such as

mining rigs efficiency, personal salaries, and actual personal
cost. Opex is mainly influenced by the electrics cost used by
mining rigs. This expenses not only include the cost of solv-
ing the hard difficult computing problems but also include the
fees that maintain rigs normal operation. As a result, these
parameters are not only difficult to estimate, but they are
also different for various cryptocurrencies. Moreover, even
for the same cryptocurrency, their values change with time.
Therefore, when we study these parameters, we focus on
the trends that are robust of the parameter range [11]. More
specifically, in [11] they use the concrete number to calculate
when the gap game could spring up, when EBRR ≈ 6, that
is, the ratio of the expected base reward and the expected
accumulated fees closes to 6, the Bitcoin network will emerge
the gap game.
However, this research uses the current parameters to cal-
culate this EBRR, this is not dependable, because the param-
eters of the Bitcoin network keep changing all the time,
after a long time, it will be another case compared to now.
For example, if the Bitcoin only remains 1 rig, that means,
the Bitcoin only have one miner to mine the block, and the
Bitcoin doesn’t need other fees to maintain its tasks. The
EBRR must be less than 6.
We don’t yet know the adjustment of the Bitcoin network
in the future, because the Bitcoin changes at every moment.
Here we modeled a simplified version of the gap model to
simulate the gap game.
There are k rigs in the Blockchain, each rig costs bBTC per
time unit in electricity to run, each block contains m rewards,
where m = 0 is the transaction fees model, that means, only
transaction fees could reward miners and no base reward. The
transaction fees reward arrive continuously at a rate of r per
time unit. When the current difficulty coefficient of mining is
determined, the expected time of mining blocks is t .
In the present, the Bitcoin network complies with the fol-
lowing Inequality (2):
kbt ≤ m1 + rt1 (2)
where t1 means the transaction fees have been happening for
t1 time units before the start mining time and m1 means the
block reward at t1 time units, because kbt ≤ m1, the miners
do not need to wait, they just start mining when the previous
block was mined. The whole process continues t time units.
However, when the gap game appears, the Bitcoin network
complies with the following inequality (3):
kbt ≤ m2 + rt2 (3)
where t2 means the transaction fees have been happening
for t2 time units, after t2 time units, the miners start mining
and they will find a block in t time units, the whole process
continues t + t2 time units. Because kbt ≥ m2 that means
current rig cost is larger than the block reward, so the miners
have to wait for t2 time units until kbt ≤ m2 + rt2, this is the
reason why the gap game formalized.
From the above analysis, we could know the gap game’s
time t ′ could be represented as follows (4):
t ′ =
kbt − m
r
(4)
When t ′ is negative, it indicates there will not have the gap
between the two blocks, which is the current situation.
Now we use Bitcoin capacity to analyze how the gap game
will influence the decentralization.
A. BITCOIN USERS
Due to the decline of the block reward, the Bitcoin users
have to increase each transaction fees to let the miners choose
their transaction. This is because miners prefer to deal with
transactions with high transaction fees. And this has led to an
increase in transaction fees across the Bitcoin. Meanwhile,
because of the very small size of the block, many small
transactions can be delayed because miners prefer high-fee
transactions. However, larger block sizes will slow down
propagation and cause blockchain forks. We can predict that
when the transaction fees increase to a point where it exceeds
the ability of some Bitcoin miners to pay, they will leave
VOLUME 7, 2019 91003
Y. Liu et al.: Decentralization is Vulnerable Under the Gap Game
Bitcoin and stop transactions. In section 3, we discussed
the decentralization model of the Bitcoin. And we list some
factors about the decentralization model. Bitcoin users are
free to participate in the system and free to leave. But in the
setting we just described, transaction fees in the system are
rising and may exceed the ability of most users to pay. At this
time, most users may choose to leave the Bitcoin because they
cannot afford the high transaction fees. The decentralization
of Bitcoin will be affected.
B. BITCOIN MINERS
What’s more, for a large k , every mining rig belongs to
Bitcoinminers can get a small share of the reward n+f t2. Few
fees reward can break the balance between mining rigs and
miners. There are two main problems with this phenomenon.
On the one hand, the miners would refuse other rigs to join
the Bitcoin network. This is because the fees reward in the
network is already very small, if there are other rigs to join,
these miners will be their share of the already small reward,
so they refused to join these new miners. On the other hand,
the other rigs would refuse to join the Bitcoin network due
to the limited rewards. For period passes, the miners would
gather as one pool and the other rigs would be rejected to join
the mining pool. When that happens, it means that most of
Bitcoin mining power may be controlled by in a large group.
Maybe rational miners are ought to form small groups to
increase their gains, leading to a centralized system. Worse
still, the miners could monopoly the mining process, which
is not good news for the whole Bitcoin.
In summary, we analyze the impact of gap game on Bitcoin
decentralization from the perspective of Bitcoin users and
miners. For Bitcoin users, the formation of the gap game
leads to a reduction in block rewards, and the user must
increase the transaction fees in order to make miners to
choose his own transactions. Only then will the miners handle
their own transactions. However, some users have limited
financial resources and do not have enough capacity to pay
high transaction fees. When this happens, these users will opt
out. Once this happens, the decentralization of the system
will be affected by the user’s participation or logging out.
For miners, if some miners have enough mining rigs to mine,
once the gap game is formed, the amount of reward will be
reduced, and the reward that each miner can get will be less
than before. At this point, the accession of new miners will
inevitably reduce the number of rewards for existing miners
in the system, so the existing miners in the system do not
want new miners to join. For miners who want to join the
system, the new accession to the system will not bring them
considerable rewards. On the contrary, the cost ofmaintaining
the operation of the mining rigs may far exceed the reward for
successful mining. In addition, when the gap game is formed,
the miners in the system are more likely to aggregate into a
coalition (thatmeans someminers banded together for acquir-
ing more benefit) in order to get more revenues by the hook.
If the power of this coalition that is comprised of rational
miners is too large, and their incentives are to deviate the
honest protocol operation. Ultimately, the decentralization of
Bitcoin will be seriously threatened.
Although the formation of gap game has affected miners
and users behaviors, the impact of gap game goes far beyond
that. Below, we will analyze the impact of this formation on
the security of the entire Bitcoin system and the stability of
the blockchain.
1) Potential Attacks
Most of the reasons why Bitcoin can achieve decen-
tralization are due to the existence of the consensus
mechanism. And the security of Bitcoin relies on the
distributed consensus mechanism achieved by the min-
ing game. In our analysis thus far, we have assumed,
as the Bitcoin miners do, they will form a coalition.
Over time, If their overall mining computational power
exceeds 50% of the total network, they may develop
into a cartel of miners [20]. They naturally showed
what a mining cartel could do if one ever comes to
exist. A cartel can change any rules which are enforced
by consensus and miners who are not in the cartel
will likely be obliged to follow. For example, a cartel
can choose any strategy in the mining game. Miners
who continue to use the old strategy risk having their
newly-mined blocks ignored as forks of the consen-
sus branch and thereby risk losing the mining reward
payments associated with those blocks. Thus, if the
cartel announces its mining strategy, it can shift the
equilibrium chosen by the non-cartel miners. Bitcoin
has value because people are willing to exchange it
for goods and services. If users are unwilling to use
Bitcoin for transactions and consumption because they
fear their payments will be invalid, the value of Bitcoin
will disappear due to users’ distrust.
Not only that, but it can also lead to another
attack that calls selfish mining [12]. They show that
even nodes with less 51% power are still dangerous.
Selfish-Mining allows a pool of sufficient size to obtain
a revenue larger than its ratio of mining power. This
strategy resulted in honest miners following the Bitcoin
protocol wasting resources on mining, but ultimately
getting nothing in return. So selfish miners tend to get
more revenue. Rational miners will be attracted to join
the selfish pool and the selfish can exceed 51% power
quickly. In [19], they showed that for small miners,
there is more to be gained and profitable from some
selfish mining strategies than simply selfish mining.
Although the gains are very small. Furthermore, it also
shows that attackers with less than 25% of the compu-
tational power can still gain from selfishmining. At this
point, when the gap game was formed, miners are more
motivated to launch some attacks by any means to
obtain higher revenues. In the end, the Bitcoin system
ceases to be a decentralized currency.
2) Influence for Blockchain
Therefore, when the gap game is formed, there will
be some serious problems in some cases, which will
91004 VOLUME 7, 2019

seriously threaten the whole Bitcoin system. So when
this kind of conflict and threat exists, the developers of
Bitcoin will take somemeasures to maintain the normal
operation of the Bitcoin system. A Bitcoin developer
is a programmer who maintains the source code for
Bitcoin. We can imagine what measures the Bitcoin
developers will take to make up for the impact of the
formation of the gap game on the Bitcoin system.
If some developers want to increase transaction
fees to maintain the normal income of miners, how-
ever, some developers do not agree with this practice,
because they are afraid that the increase of transac-
tion fees will make small transactions gather together
and form a mining pool, threatening the stability and
security of Bitcoin. As a result, differences of opin-
ion among developers will lead to a fork in Bitcoin.
For example, Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash [21]. At first,
Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash were both Bitcoin, but one
day, Bitcoin’s developers had different opinions. These
divergences of developers led to different developers
designing two different versions of the mining soft-
ware. The two versions are incompatible, so miners
cannot communicate with each other. So it is impos-
sible for the miners to put an end to the bifurcation.
This kind of fork is called a hard fork. A hard fork [22]
refers to a permanent split in the blockchain, where
an old version does not accept a legal block created
by a new version and considers a legal block created
by a new version to be illegal. So clearly hard forks
are not forward compatible. The other kind of fork is
called the soft fork. Soft fork forward compatibility,
the old version will accept the block created by the
new version, in the soft fork, the miners only need to
upgrade to the new version, users can continue to use
the old version of the protocol, they will still accept the
block created by the new version of the protocol. So the
soft fork is not ‘‘real’’ fork. The end result of the fork
is bound to be some fluctuation in the intrinsic value of
the Bitcoin.
If all the developers agree that the gap game will
have a huge impact on Bitcoin. They decided to modify
the consensus mechanism of the whole system and
change the existing proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism
into the proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism. The concept
of coinage is introduced into the proof-of-stake (PoS)
system [23]–[25] . The coinage of a person is related
to the amount of money he has and the time he holds
the coin. As a result, the more Bitcoin you have and
the longer you keep them, and the more likely you
are to generate a new block. Therefore, in the PoS
system, there are nomining rigs. It solves themonopoly
problem of the large computational power mining pool,
and there is no mining gap problem as well. Therefore,
the change of consensus mechanism can reduce or even
eliminate the influence brought by the formation of a
gap game.
To sum up, the formation of gap game has exerted a
significant impact on the existing Bitcoin system. On the
one hand, it has compromised the decentralized nature of
Bitcoin by making it easier for miners to launch attacks on
the system. On the other hand, it also has a significant impact
on the blockchain. The formation of gap gamemay lead to the
divergence of opinions amongBitcoin developers, whichmay
result in a fork of blockchain or change of system consensus
mechanism.
VI. BLOCKCHAIN CAPACITY
At present, Bitcoin is often referred to as the first cryptocur-
rency and one of the most hotly discussed cryptocurrencies,
which has achieved great success. The blockchain is the
main mechanism for the Bitcoin. In previous work, when
they talked about blockchain capacity, theymostly mentioned
block capacity, but the capacity we are going to talk about is
the capacity of the reward in the whole Bitcoin. An important
aspect of the design of Bitcoin is mining, in which partici-
pants expend resources to solve difficult computing problems
and get rewards. When this difficult problem is resolved,
it allows a valid block to be generated, for which the miner
will receive a certain amount of Bitcoin.
Our analysis is based on [18], they describe some Bit-
coin mining systems and analyze their advantages and dis-
advantages. In our work, we will analyze the impact on the
two reward systems when the gap game is formed. When a
valid block is generated, the miner who finds the block will
receive an amount of Bitcoin rewards, which is represented
by B. We use D to represent the difficulty coefficient, which
is periodically adjusted by the system. In [18], we know
that there are many problems with solo individual mining.
Therefore, we only consider the pools reward system, where
several miners work together to find new blocks and distribute
rewards according to the contributions of miners [18]. If the
total hashrate of all miners is H, a single miner with hashrate
is:
h = qH (5)
q is the ratio of the pool’s total power contributed by the
miner. Each pool is managed by a pool operator who may be
required to charge a service fee for the service. This is usually
a fixed percentage of f of the block reward. Therefore, for
each block was found, the operator will charge fB and the
remaining (1− f )Bwill be allocated to the remaining miners.
Now we will consider what happens to two simple reward
systems [18] when the gap game is formed. The first is the
proportional system, which is the most intuitional system
to embody the principles of pools mining. The payment is
calculated built on the division of the round in this system,
where the round is the time interval between the new block
foundation and the previous block. A new block will be
generated at the end of each round. As a result, the mining
pool can get the reward of B, the operator will retain the cost
of ρB, meanwhile, the remaining (1−ρ)B will be distributed
among the remaining miners. The amount of reward will be
VOLUME 7, 2019 91005
Y. Liu et al.: Decentralization is Vulnerable Under the Gap Game
FIGURE 2. The simplified version of the gap game. The block reward from 0 to 25, and the rate of the
transaction fees from 1/600 to 1/100, the block reward equal to 6 is sufficient to avoid the gap game.
proportional to the shares submitted by the miners during
this round. If a miner submits n shares in this round and the
total amount of shares submitted in this round is N , then the
miner’s reward during this round could be denoted as Re( nN ):
Re(
n
N
) =
n
N
(1− ρ)B (6)
In case that the list of miners and the hashrate of eachminer
are fixed, then the number of shares the miner submits in
each round will be proportional to his hashrate. Therefore,
the expected reward on the number of shares submitted per
share is:
(1− ρ)pB (7)
Each share has a probability of p = 1
D to be a valid block.
Thus the average rewards per share are (1− ρ)pB.
In the case of a fixed number of miners in the mining pool,
when the gap game is formed, according to our previous anal-
ysis, we can know that the reward of the whole mining pool is
reduced, which will reduce the average reward of each share.
For the miners internal the pool, their expected reward will be
reduced, and even these rewards cannot support the expenses
(including Capex and Opex) of their rigs. For external miners
who want to join the pool, the average reward from the pool
is reduced, making the pool less attractive to outside miners.
As time goes on, the pool becomes less attractive, and even
some of the internal miners have done everything possible to
increase their rewards, reducing the due reward for the rest
of the honest miners. Still not only such, but the fact that the
internal miners want to leave and the external miners don’t
want to join will undermine the points of the decentralization
model that we proposed earlier.
Another type of reward system is called pay-per-share
(PPS) [18]. In the PPS system, the operator works with
participants to reduce personal variance. Either way, many
blocks are finally found, when a miner submits a share,
he is immediately rewarded with (1 − ρ)pB, amount to the
expected value of this share’s reward minus fees. However,
this system has several advantages for miners. And this is
the most dangerous reward system for the pool operator
because the operator can offer zero variance to the miners,
but he must balance all the variance by his own revenue.
So in order to compensate risk, the operator will charge more
fees than the other methods, which is the disadvantage of
the PPS. But if the operator does not properly balance the
pool fees with his financial revenues, the pool is likely to
go bankrupt. As derived in [18], with the bankruptcy prob-
ability below δ, the operator should keep a reserve of at
least:
R =
Bln 1
δ
2ρ
(8)
For PPS reward system, when the gap game is formed,
the block rewards B in the pool keep decreasing. More than
that, with certain bankruptcy probability δ, the operator’s
reserve R is also decreased. In this case, the operator revenues
are reduced, the formation of the mining pool is easier than
before. Nevertheless, when the gap game is formed, the for-
mation of a mining pool is effortless. Combined with these
changes in the PPS system, the formation of the large pool is
accelerated than at any time. And the formation of the large
mining pool will pose a fatal threat to the decentralization
system.

VII. EVALUATION
From the above analysis, we could learn that the gap game
is detrimental to the decentralization system. Meanwhile,
the gap game also damages to the other aspects of the decen-
tralized system. What’s more, the original features of the
decentralized system may also be harmed due to the gap
game. Now we refer the parameters from [11], to simulate
the gap game in our proposed simplified version of the gap
game.
We use the result: EBRR = 6 is sufficient to avoid mining
gaps in the presented scenario. And we put into the block
reward from 0 to 25, and the rate of the transaction fees from
1/600 to 1/100.
We illustrate the result as Fig 2. The vertical axis is the
expected time of mining blocks, due to the lower block
rewards, the time of mining blocks is increasing, which
means, the miner is waiting for the sufficient transaction fees
to support the expenses of the mining process. The Threshold
line is when the reward of each block equals to 6, all of
the blocks with the reward greater than 6 does not have the
worries about the gap game. Conversely, the gap game will
be formalized if the reward of each block is less than 6,
especially when the reward rate of the transaction fees is less.
We could summarize the findings from the simplified ver-
sion of the gap game, the Bitcoin system has to increase the
transaction fees or inspire the users open up the new trans-
action for the sake of mitigation of the gap game, however,
we have discussed this before, this will let the Bitcoin users
out of the system, which is harmful to the decentralization
of the Bitcoin system. Another way to make the gap game
retarded is that the Bitcoin miners should leave the Bitcoin
system to let the expense of the mining process get lower,
which is not a good situation for a decentralization system.
From the above analysis, we could learn that the gap game is
detrimental to the decentralization system.
VIII. CONCLUSION
In this work, we defined the decentralization model and the
mining model based on [11]. For the decentralization model,
we summarize the three main characteristics; And for the
miningmodel, we analyze some possible behaviors of mining
pool miners and users in the Bitcoin during the gap game.
In addition, we analyze the impact of these behaviors on our
decentralization model. Not only that, but we also analyzed
the potential attacks on Bitcoin by malicious miners due to
the reduction of block rewards after the formation of the gap
game. And this formation may also lead to the instability
of the blockchain structure and changes in the consensus
mechanism. In the end, we talk about blockchain reward
capacity, also analyzes the impact of the formation of gap
game on two common reward systems in Bitcoin, namely,
proportional reward system and pay-per-share(PPS) system.
Hence, we can come to some conclusions. First of all,
the block reward (the same meaning as the base reward) is
critical for Bitcoin security, especially for the decentralization
of Bitcoin. The formation of the gap game will decrease the
block rewards in Bitcoin, thus undermining the freedom of
miners and users to participate in the Bitcoin, and ultimately
undermining the decentralization nature of the whole system.
Secondly, With the continuous formation of the gap game,
the Bitcoin reward system will change from block reward
to transaction fees. The existing Bitcoin reward system will
be seriously affected, and the transaction fee system seems
harder to analyze equilibrium than a block reward system.
Therefore, it is urgent to take certain measures for the for-
mation of the gap game.
