1.1  Introduction
For almost three decades or so, an intense technological diffusion is 
observed across most sectors, industries and societies around the world. 
Technology and digitisation have changed the way we love, transact, 
interact, work, commute, bank, lead, educate and manage our health. 
Robots, Big Data, Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality, 
Blockchain and similar technologies, are currently utilized by organisa-
tions towards improving efficiency, minimising costs, saving time, and 
achieving advantage over their competitors (Efthymiou et al., 2019).

Often, technologies take the form of minor improvements, which 
enhance users’ effort, or disruptive forces, capable of changing the rules 
of the game in an entire sector.
However, technology is not a trouble-free magic stick, capable of offer-
ing a solution to every problem. A more realistic examination reveals 
that, like most phenomena, technology reminds the two sides of a coin. 
While it may offer enormous advantages, it may also become a huge lia-
bility. For instance, not all organisations are ready to adopt new technolo-
gies. Their culture, workforce, budget and current processes, may be 
unprepared to embrace complex technologies. Not to mention the bur-
den of ongoing training, security risks, continuous updates and large cost 
of maintenance, especially for small businesses. Other drawbacks include 
the risk of loss of information, and technology’s negative impact on soci-
ety, among others (Efthymiou & Michael, 2016). While technologies 
may offer remedy to businesses in crisis, they may become the crisis itself 
(Vrontis et al., 2022a, 2022b, 2022c). In addition, some technologies 
appear ahead of their time; after exploiting considerable resources, they 
end up in blustering failures (Batiz-Lazo & Efthymiou, 2016). Within 
this framework, the current chapter offers an overview of technology dif-
fusion in different workplaces and sectors, with a focus on markets and 
marketing.
1.2  Contextual and Theoretical Foundations
Technology has transformed nearly every aspect of not only human life, but 
also corporate life. As the years go by, the entire business world is leaning 
more and more toward it (Favoretto et al., 2022), making it almost unlikely 
to separate (Chatterjee et al., 2022a) the two from each other. Innovation 
drives business (Hahn, 2020), and since technology prepares the ground for 
it (Mikalef & Krogstie, 2020), it can be deduced from here that business 
requires technology to be sustained. Technological evolution seems to speed 
up exponentially along with its capacity (Chatterjee et al., 2022a), accessi-
bility (Ferreira & Franco, 2019) and variety (Huang & Rust, 2020). Versatile 
smart solutions (empowered by artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of 
 A. Thrassou et al.

Things (IoTs), machine learning (ML), augmented reality (AR), etc.) prom-
ise game-changing advancements (Haaker et al., 2021) in marketing and 
consumption practices. Thus, it should come as no surprise that firms in 
practically every business sector (e.g., healthcare, manufacturing, retailing, 
financial) are constantly and steadily increasing their technology investment 
(Singh et al., 2019), driven to reach various objectives (Verhoef et al., 2021).
In times of globalization and technological progress, businesses are facing 
rapid changes both in customer needs (Kathpal, 2020) as well as in the 
nature of the markets (Mele et al., 2019). Thanks to smart phones and other 
internet-connected devices (Wang, 2021), and applications customers can 
get what they want almost exactly when they need it (Thrassou et al., 2020). 
As today’s consumers become increasingly tech- savvy (Shah & Murthi, 
2021) and aware of what they can do with technology (Handarkho, 2020), 
they demand fast and seamless digital experiences (Grewal et al., 2020) and 
expect instant responses to their needs (Thrassou et al., 2020) whatever 
channel they are using. In response, firms are changing the way they do 
business (Wisetsri et al., 2021) by accelerating the application of technology 
(digital transformation) and reinventing business processes (Singh et al., 
2019; Vial, 2019; Verhoef et al., 2021), organizational structures (Hahn, 
2020), and business models (Venkatesh et al., 2019). Investments in certain 
technologies do confer benefits such as lower costs (Haaker et al., 2021) and 
higher efficiency (Wang, 2021), and more capably meet the expectations 
stakeholders (Chatterjee et al., 2022b). That is why the notion of innova-
tion, which moves a company forward, is now becoming more important.
1.3  Technologies Diffusion in Marketing
Transformative technologies are opening a myriad of possibilities for 
marketing applications (Vial, 2019). Although the application of digital 
technologies in marketing undergone several intriguing stages of trans-
formation (Favoretto et al., 2022), each stage has helped change 
(Venkatesh et al., 2019) and enhance the scope and role of the marketing 
function within the organization (Davenport et al., 2020). The outcome 
is further broadening of the scope of marketing with tech-enabled mar-
keting practices (Deighton et al., 2021) that have the potential to deliver

‘improved operational efficiency’ (Kopalle et al., 2021), ‘better marketing 
insights’ (Kumar et al., 2021), and ‘more innovative ways to engage with 
customers of the firm’ (Shah & Shay, 2019; Shah & Murthi, 2021).
In the context of Fourth Industrial Revolution, four “new-age tech-
nologies”—the Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), 
Machine Learning (ML), and blockchain—are particularly noteworthy. 
These technologies are in a widespread manner considered to be the way 
of the future (Kumar et al., 2021) and serve as the basis for other trends 
that are likely to gain steam in the years ahead (Pereira et al., 2021). Some 
examples of promising applications include rapid growth in development 
of IoT-enabled consumer devices (Haaker et al., 2021), which tracks and 
records the patterns of how consumers interact with those devices 
(Hoffman et al., 2022), such as smart watches, security devices, fitness 
trackers, home assistants, and kitchen appliances (Liu et al., 2021), test-
ing new products (Chatterjee et al., 2021), and improving consumers’ 
shopping experience (Dwivedi et al., 2021).
Although firms have already been applying these new-age technologies 
to their marketing activities and business tasks (Kumar et al., 2021), they 
have only just begun to examine (Chintalapati & Paney, 2021) the inte-
grated application of these technologies to marketing strategies. In this 
context, there has been an apparent shift towards data-driven marketing 
strategies (Flavian et al., 2019), steering firms towards harnessing the 
power of new-age technologies (Shah & Murthi, 2021) to further improve 
all units of their business, especially marketing (Deighton et al., 2021). 
The potential of new-age technologies which allows firms to integrate 
data from multiple sources (Themistocleous, 2019) and mine it using 
sophisticated analytical techniques and equipment (Liu et al., 2021; 
Mikalef & Krogstie, 2020) to extract powerful insights (Vial, 2019) has 
prompted firms to examine new-age technologies keenly. Besides employ-
ing these new-age technologies to solve existing problems and/or aug-
ment existing capabilities (Wedel et al., 2020), firms have begun to 
comprehend the new business opportunities provided by these new-age 
technologies (Thrassou et al., 2020).
Briefly, in a constantly changing business environment that has increas-
ingly become digital and technology-enabled (Thrassou et al., 2020), it 
was in this period that the world witnessed an interesting evolution in the 
 A. Thrassou et al.

dynamics of marketing. Over time, this evolution has pulled through the 
expansion of the scope of the marketing function in businesses (Mele 
et al., 2019) “from being primarily involved in developing and managing 
creative communication to implementing data-driven and technology- 
enabled marketing practices that are not only relevant to the firm and 
consumers but also financially accountable” (Shah & Murthi, 
2021, p.774).
1.4  New Forms of Consumer 
and Firm Interactions
Firms can no longer bank on engaging with their customers in isolated 
interactions (Qin, 2020) since the future of marketing hinges on gaining 
a holistic understanding of customers’ needs and behaviors across devices, 
multifaced platforms and varied products and services (Kopalle et al., 
2021). When engaging with brands, customers today expect effortless 
(Singh et al., 2019), seamless (Wang, 2021), and intuitive (Verhoef et al., 
2021) experiences across touchpoints, and if applied strategically, digital 
transformation can enable firms to meet (Vial, 2019; Verhoef et al., 
2021), and even exceed these expectations (Thrassou et al., 2020).
New technologies have often been effectively deployed to make new 
forms of interactions between consumers and firms possible. AI, for 
example, is a powerful engine in replacing human representatives 
(Chatterjee et al., 2021) of the firm with machine agents (Huang & Rust, 
2020) and simplifying firm–consumer interactions through “word of 
machine” (Kopalle et al., 2021). In addition, anthropomorphized chat-
bots can influence consumer responses in a customer-service context 
and/or behavioral intentions to make purchases (Shah & Shay, 2019). As 
another example, augmented reality is used to facilitate firm–consumer 
interactions in retailing industry, which, as a “try before you buy” tech-
nology, is especially highly effective when consumers are unsure about 
purchasing new or unknown products.
Such technological advancements and ubiquitous adoption of hand- 
held devices (Singh et al., 2019) have also transformed consumer 
1 An Overview of Business Advancement Through Technology… 
6
behavior significantly, directly contributing to their interaction with 
brands (Qin, 2020) and social commerce usage to make decisions and 
purchase online (Handarkho, 2020). Moreover, consumer attitudes 
toward online shopping have positively influenced with the increasing 
use of digital marketing and social media (Qin, 2020), resulting in 
increased market share for eCommerce centric organizations (Handarkho, 
2020). Given the increasing number of shopping channels in the multi-
channel environment (Kumar et al., 2021), which creates a more diffused 
consumer shopping experience (Kathpal, 2020) has also influenced con-
sumer behavior. Mobile channels have become the norm thanks to 
emerging digital trends (Thrassou et al., 2020) and are increasingly inte-
grated into consumers’ daily lives through innovative mobile tools (Pereira 
et al., 2021) like shopping applications, location-based services and 
mobile wallets (Handarkho, 2020)—all influencing the consumer expe-
rience (Flavian et al., 2019; Kathpal, 2020). Apparently, the automation 
of activities (Hahn, 2020) and reduced need for human intervention 
(Pereira et al., 2021) is the most evident benefit to customers. The con-
nectivity of IoT devices makes customers’ lives simpler and hassle free 
with “the convenience and flexibility of being able to remotely monitor, 
control, and manage all of their connected devices at the click of a but-
ton” (Kumar et al., 2021, p.871). The automated nature of intelligent 
(personal/digital) assistants like Google Assistant, Siri, Amazon, etc. 
(Chintalapati & Paney, 2021) can provide a more customized experience 
for consumers that are personally relevant to them (Kathpal, 2020), by 
automatically monitoring and making price comparisons (Mele et al., 
2019), and personalized recommendations based on a few simple queries 
(Wedel et al., 2020), made possible by their advanced analytical capabili-
ties (Mikalef & Krogstie, 2020). When customers receive communica-
tions (Kathpal, 2020) and offerings that are relevant to their personal 
needs and preferences (Qin, 2020), they are more inclined to engage with 
the firm in the long run (Wang, 2021) and directly contribute by pur-
chasing or consuming the firm’s products or services (Shah & Murthi, 
2021), as well as by providing feedback, creating word-of-mouth (WOM) 
on social media, and recommending its products to other customers 
(Deighton et al., 2021). In today’s digital age, customers are also 
 A. Thrassou et al.

increasingly willing to share their thoughts and experiences about brands 
with others.
Furthermore, customers can take the advantage of the transparency 
that blockchain technologies afford in their purchases (Shah & Shay, 
2019) by tracing the entire life-cycle of a product (Chatterjee et al., 
2022a) to verify their authenticity (Liu et al., 2021) and evaluate the 
alignment of a firm’s values with their own (Hahn, 2020). As customers 
today are highly conscious (Handarkho, 2020) and very concerned about 
issues regarding the origin of products (Hahn, 2020) that they consume, 
transparency offered by blockchain helps them connect more closely with 
(Shah & Shay, 2019), and generate positive attitudes towards the firm 
and its offerings (Dwivedi et al., 2021). This, in turn, encourages custom-
ers to place greater trust (Liu et al., 2021) in these brands and to patron-
ize their offerings (Shah & Shay, 2019) in the long run.
Social networking sites (SNSs), enabled by web 2.0 technology, have 
provided individuals new forms of expression and engagement (Liu et al., 
2021), where they act as contributors/producers (prosumers) rather than 
as passive consumers (Dwivedi et al., 2021). Online communities and 
fandom behavior have particularly altered the consumer-brand relation-
ship (Qin, 2020) in such a way that consumers take more active 
(Chatterjee et al., 2022a) and enthusiastic roles as prosumers and brand 
ambassadors (Hahn, 2020) by creating brand-related user-generated con-
tent (Br-UGC) (Wang, 2021). Br-UGC is particularly effective, allowing 
users to generate and share media content to their social circle (Davenport 
et al., 2020) while achieving considerable reach through dynamic social 
networks (Kathpal, 2020). Given the ability of SNSs to allow users to 
gather information and exchange opinions (Handarkho, 2020), it is an 
obvious fact that consumers are no longer passive recipients of the mar-
keting communication process (Mele et al., 2019) instead they are assum-
ing active and participatory roles (Singh et al., 2019) in brand 
co-production (Hahn, 2020), creation, promotion and distribution 
(Wedel et al., 2020), resulting in accelerating market expansion and 
increasing brand awareness (Dwivedi et al., 2021). To increase the satis-
faction levels of online communities, it is important to identify the needs 
and demands of members of these online communities (Grewal et al., 
2020), create special offerings that fit those needs and demands (Vial, 
1 An Overview of Business Advancement Through Technology…

2019) and effectively communicate/interact with members (Wisetsri 
et al., 2021) just as in traditional marketing. As a direct outcome of the 
increased automation (Hoffman et al., 2022) and interconnectivity of 
business functions (Shah & Murthi, 2021), customers can utilize more 
flexibility in how and where they want/select to interact with a firm 
(Wang, 2021) depending on their personal preferences (Kumar 
et al., 2021).
As Br-UGC is merging with online shopping (Dwivedi et al., 2021), 
“consumers integrate browsing, exploring and sharing with different 
forms of content” (Wang, 2021, p.3). Social networking platforms, there-
fore, make marketing “organic” (Liu et al., 2021) by integrating market-
ing activities into consumer daily life activities (Qin, 2020) when they are 
using mobile apps to share photos, express opinions, visit website, etc. 
(Wang, 2021). An “organic” marketing strategy, which merges shopping 
and daily routine of consumers (Kathpal, 2020) on mobile times, natu-
rally increases traffic (Wedel et al., 2020) and sales (Thrassou et al., 2020) 
with a little support from any form of content (Wang, 2021)—text, 
posts, images, videos, reviews, etc. Consequently, marketing is truly 
interactive, organic and dynamic business activity (Wisetsri et al., 2021) 
witnessing this transformation on a very intense scale.
1.5  New Strategic Frameworks
“The growth of digital platforms has displaced traditional intermedia not 
only by creating a new type of superpower of omnichannel marketplace 
spanning online and offline retailers but also changed business models 
from a linear supply chain pipeline to a complex network of producers 
and users in an interconnected ecosystem” reported by Wang (2021, 
p. 2). Through enhanced network effect of social media particularly (Qin, 
2020), the platform provides an infrastructure which gathers external 
sellers and buyers and creates interaction, regardless of sources through 
data-driven matchmaking (Themistocleous, 2019; Shah & Murthi, 
2021). Inescapably, the process of value creation is vigorously moving 
from the firm- and product-centric approach to interactive and personal-
ized experience (Flavian et al., 2019; Kathpal, 2020). As a channel of 
 A. Thrassou et al.
9
direct consumer-brand interaction, brand shopping platforms allow con-
sumers to browse and discover the new products/trends (Kathpal, 2020) 
and receive real-time customized recommendations (Mikalef & Krogstie, 
2020). As another communication platform, brand communities built 
by SNSs (Dwivedi et al., 2021) bring users, who contribute to brand 
communication by sharing branded content, together (Liu et al., 2021). 
Such media sharing platforms enable both marketers and users to dis-
seminate brand-related information (Chintalapati & Paney, 2021) and 
promote interactions through authentic and trustworthy practice 
(Qin, 2020).
The increased availability of rich data, due to new-age technologies, 
has the potential to enhance the volume, and quality of market and con-
sumer data (Themistocleous, 2019). For instance, the widespread use of 
digital devices, such as computers, mobiles, smartwatches, etc. (Haaker 
et al., 2021) and software applications like web browsers, database soft-
ware, mobile apps, social media and so on (Qin, 2020; Liu et al., 2021), 
has resulted in data streams that record events as they happen 
(Themistocleous, 2019), including how consumers feel (Grewal et al., 
2020), think (Liu et al., 2021), act (Mele et al., 2019), and interact (Qin, 
2020) with firms and other consumers at various points throughout their 
digital journey (Wedel et al., 2020). While previously being out of reach 
for many firms, it recently became ubiquitous as the cost to collect and 
analyze data (Themistocleous, 2019), such as “eye movement, speech, 
facial recognition, and genetic data” (Hoffman et al., 2022, p.3), rapidly 
decreases (Chatterjee et al., 2022a; Favoretto et al., 2022). Furthermore, 
data-capture technology, especially AI-enabled, which generate data on 
consumer–firm interactions (Qin, 2020; Shah & Murthi, 2021) via 
video, audio/speech, photos/images and text shared on platform- 
orchestrated multi-sided network sites, among others, has also enabled 
large-scale field experiments (Venkatesh et al., 2019) that allow compa-
nies to examine the causal outcomes of their marketing actions and/or 
strategies (Favoretto et al., 2022). Marketers can use these investigations 
to optimize their website designs (Haaker et al., 2021), effectively create 
retarget advertising (Ferreira & Franco, 2019) and assess the effects of 
new marketing technologies (Verhoef et al., 2021).

Researchers confess that “these technological innovations and the 
resulting applications and solutions, with their unprecedented effects and 
unfamiliar outcomes, compel marketers to get ahead of the knowledge 
curve” (Grewal et al., 2020, p.1). Technology enabled innovations, ana-
lytics, data storage, and solutions emphasize opportunities for marketers 
to create, communicate, collect, and deliver value for and with their cus-
tomers (Mikalef & Krogstie, 2020). Firms can determine forthcoming 
trends and plan responses in advance (for instance, change delivery 
mechanisms, develop new products, etc.) by leveraging the power of 
insights (Pereira et al., 2021) from advanced analytic and/or data mining 
techniques (Mikalef & Krogstie, 2020; Liu et al., 2021). Firms, further, 
respond and/or adapt to these trends more efficiently and effectively by 
interconnecting business functions (Mikalef & Krogstie, 2020) and the 
automation of analytical and business processes (Liu et al., 2021). Firms 
can, in so doing, surprise and mesmerize customers by anticipating their 
needs (Kathpal, 2020) and offering experiences that are aligned with 
their requirements (Flavian et al., 2019).
Customers’ expectations for personalized experiences have increased 
tremendously. Firms can gain comprehensive insights that help them to 
manage the demands of their existing customers (Deighton et al., 2021) 
and improve their experiences (Kathpal, 2020) as a consequence of access 
to real-time and more detailed information about customers (Mikalef & 
Krogstie, 2020), along with more advanced data mining capabilities 
(Themistocleous, 2019; Mikalef & Krogstie, 2020). By understanding 
the personal preferences of customers with respect to marketing mix vari-
ables (Davenport et al., 2020) (in connection with a big picture perspec-
tive of all customers together), firms can develop and provide customized 
services and communication practices (Dwivedi et al., 2021). In this con-
text, new-age technologies, for instance, AI, allow a firm to convey right 
message to the right customer in the right medium (Shah & Shay, 2019; 
Chintalapati & Paney, 2021) at the right time (Huang & Rust, 2020). 
Furthermore, firms can work towards lowering the customer loss by 
developing nuanced ‘customer churn models’ (Favoretto et al., 2022) 
that can better forecast future behaviors of customers (Kopalle et al., 2021).
In addition to developing customized marketing strategies to engage 
with their customers (Huang & Rust, 2020), new-age technologies also

hold the key for firms to engage directly with their stakeholders (i.e., sup-
pliers) (Chatterjee et al., 2022a). For example, they can create digital and 
automated smart contracts by using blockchain which allows firms to use 
micro-currencies to directly and instantly reward customer engagement 
(Shah & Shay, 2019). Firms’ engagement strategies can be modified in 
the future (Liu et al., 2021) to communicate directly (without mediators 
such as media planning or buying firms) with individual customers in 
real-time (Mikalef & Krogstie, 2020) about their products and services, 
offers, and so on. Thus, they can authenticate that they are actually reach-
ing the audience for whom they have paid (Huang & Rust, 2020), as well 
as monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of their marketing efforts 
(Handarkho, 2020). In this way, they can also communicate with cus-
tomers in an observable and verifiable way around their values (Kathpal, 
2020), accordingly increasing customers’ trust in them (Vial, 2019).
As a result of increased automation, more comprehensive insights, and 
better interconnectivity of business functions (Favoretto et al., 2022), 
firms can improve their product development (Chatterjee et al., 2022a) 
and enhancement processes (Kumar et al., 2021) and achieve process 
optimization (Davenport et al., 2020). Since they can monitor their 
equipment (and their usage), and proactively carry out maintenance 
(Shah & Shay, 2019) with technology enabled innovations, analytics, 
data storage, and solutions, they can expect to reducing operating 
expenses, increasing productivity, and improving the efficiency (Hahn, 
2020). The rise of chatbots, intelligent agents, robotics and etc. has pro-
moted the growth of automated customer support alternatives to handle 
routine enquiries (Wisetsri et al., 2021) and address more complex issues. 
These automated agents can provide efficient customer service (Pereira 
et al., 2021), lower costs, and provide outstanding (Thrassou et al., 2020) 
and consistent service quality (Venkatesh et al., 2019) by learning with 
each interaction (Qin, 2020).

1.6  Book Content and Structure
With these considerations in mind, this book is organized in an attempt 
to understand the technological improvements in the field of global mar-
keting. The current book presents another 11 chapter, aiming to advance 
our understanding on how technological innovations are likely to shape 
the practice and discipline of marketing for the next several decades. The 
careful selection of chapters considering their quality, their relatedness to 
the book theme, and the significance of their contribution to knowledge 
through solid empirical and/or conceptual scientific theorization serves 
multiple purposes, whereas, the value is both contemporary and histori-
cal. In putting this works together, we were gratified to provide compel-
ling, multidisciplinary insights from researchers working across the 
marketing, IT, and strategy domains.
Chapter 2 is titled ‘Digital transformation of the organisations using 
AI integrated partner relationship management’. The analysis communi-
cates the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and its impact on busi-
nesses. AI has several applications in finance, customer relationships, 
human resource management, service management, legal department of 
the firms, supply chain management, and so on. The analysis explains 
how different industries use various kinds of AI applications to improve 
their efficiency and enhance their profitability. But applications of AI also 
have several issues such as AI algorithms’ biasness, privacy infringements, 
customer profiling without consent, legal issues related to personhood, 
and so on. Without the integration of AI with their existing applications, 
it is not possible for the business to digitally transform their various func-
tionalities. Thus, the authors (Sheshadri Chatterjee, Ranjan Chaudhuri 
and Demetris Vrontis) introduce Partner Relationship Management 
(PRM), an application integrated with different functions of the organ-
isation. This system uses various methodologies, software, strategies, and 
web-based capability for information exchange with different stakehold-
ers. Integration of PRM with artificial intelligence (AI) can help organ-
isation in accurate and quick decision making. The study concludes with 
some recommendations to policy makers, government agencies, and cor-
porate practitioners.

Then, Chap. 3, looks at the banking sector (titled: Creating Value 
Proposition for Rural Banking Customers in Emerging Markets: 
Adoption of Mobile Banking Technology Induced by Disruptive Events 
in India). Nitin Shankar and Sana Moid focus on India’s ongoing transi-
tion to a cashless economy through mobile phones and the Internet. 
Cutting-edge technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, 
Cloud, Internet of Things, Human Computer Interface (HCI) and 
Blockchain are likely to further enhance digital banking and associated 
financial inclusion for unbanked citizens. This effort comes with a chang-
ing consumer mind-set towards the adoption of technology, which was 
cultivated by enforced Covid-19 lockdowns and national Demonetization. 
Drawing on a survey, conducted among citizens in rural areas, the chap-
ter examines further the behavioral drivers and restraining factors of rural 
banked customers towards mobile banking technology.
Subsequently, Chap. 4, titled ‘A review of internet financing through 
peer-to-peer lending: A cross-country comparative analysis’, provides a 
literature review of the internet finance in China. More specifically, the 
author (Panagiotis E. Dimitropoulos) focuses on online P2P lending and 
its contribution to business advancement. Technological developments 
have manifested into several dimensions within business and entrepre-
neurship. Internet finance (through peer-to-peer lending) is one such 
advancement which has developed rapidly in recent years and has also 
brought new challenges to financial management, investments, business 
financing and growth. However, the development of internet financing 
has also created some additional risks within the financial market. The 
findings present implications for platform managers, lenders, and 
borrowers.
Chapter 5 examines the ‘Digitalisation of Love and Lies on Online 
Dating Platforms in Coronavirus Times: Advancement through 
Technology’. Covid-19 facilitated a different form of technology-assisted 
dating. Instead of meeting in person as before the pandemic, in restau-
rants, bars or pubs, daters were more inclined to meet digitally, preferring 
meetings via Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Skype. As a result, businesses 
were advanced through digitalisation, online services, computers, mobile 
phones, outdoor gear, walking and running shoes and bicycles and bicy-
cle gear. While previous researchers focus mainly on ‘lies’ and ‘deception’

(Markowitz & Hancock, 2018), Ursula Schinzel reveals a transition to 
‘love’ and ‘trust’.
The following chapter (Chap. 6, titled: ‘The social impact of clinical 
tools for neuromarketing research: possible applications for the wine sec-
tor’, by Giuseppe Festa, Elenica Pjero, Simone Feoli) engages with new 
instruments adopted in neuroscientific activities, within the field of neu-
rosciences. The study offers a brief introduction to neuromarketing 
research, while focusing on the theme of ethical sustainability, proposing 
some possible solutions, with specific examples in the field of wine 
marketing.
Also, in the field of social media, Chap. 7 examines ‘The influence of 
Facebook discussions on purchase intention and word-of-mouth’. The 
main question driving the study concerns Facebook discussions, their 
perceived credibility, and how they are linked to behavioral intentions. 
After reviewing relevant literature, the first part presents a research model 
linking seven constructs. In the second part, H. Krasila, H. Karjaluoto 
and Munnukka Juha have tested the research model and hypotheses with 
a sample of 151 consumers from one Facebook group dealing with shoe 
recommendations for kids. Out of the seven hypotheses tested, six were 
supported. The findings reveal that the higher consumers rank the 
Facebook comment writers in terms of their expertise and trustworthi-
ness, the higher the perceived WOM credibility is. In addition, the results 
reveal that perceived WOM credibility is strongly linked with brand 
awareness, purchase intention and WOM.
Chapter 8, ‘Discourse on Method: Rapid, efficient, cost-effective cre-
ation of “wikis of the mind”’, presents a process to create an integrated 
database of the mind concerning how people decide when presented with 
a topic or problem and combinations of metaphors representing solu-
tions. The authors (Howard Moskowitz, Arthur Kover, Stephen Rappaport, 
Ariola Harizi, Petraq Papajorgji, Ardita Todri and Laura Stefania 
Rodriguez Bejarano), use an experimental design to create test combina-
tions of solution statements (vignettes). The respondent evaluates differ-
ent scenarios (or vignettes) created using the experimental design theory. 
Each vignette represents a metaphor for the solution to the problem, and 
it is presented to the respondent using a Likert scale. The data are then 
subject to OLS (ordinary least-square) regression at the level of the

individual respondent to derive unique decision rules. Data mining and 
clustering technologies are used to group similar respondents into mind-
sets. The process is generalized so that the same experiment structure can 
be used for several dozen different problems. The process is illustrated by 
addressing 27 social issues and a set of 16 metaphors representing 
solutions.
Moreover, the next two chapters in the book concentrate on health 
sector. Chapter 9, ‘How Technologies Assessment Conceptualization and 
their Certification could help the Medical Business Boosting Performance’, 
by Larisa Mihoreanu, looks for innovative standards of quality in the 
health sector, through continuous assessment of technologies and care 
services evaluation. The analysis is current as it takes place in the light of 
ongoing pandemic (COVID-19), and the need to increase responsiveness 
and resilience worldwide. The comparative analyses show that health 
technologies assessment’s alignment with international requirements 
brings all medical businesses to conformity and assures their fair, legal 
and ethical regularity and consistency.
Chapter 10, by Lior Naamati-Schneider, concerns an exploratory 
study conducted in dental clinics. It presents the mapping of perceptions 
and difficulties in adapting to a competitive market in the digital era. The 
study, presents the highlights of a qualitative pilot study of dentists who 
run private clinics in Israel. It sheds light on how health organisations, 
such as private clinics, adapt their management structure to a competitive 
market in the digital age and the obstacles they encounter. The findings 
fill a knowledge gap in this field, enable a better understanding of the 
functioning of health organisations and private clinics, and are the basis 
for recommendations and action plans that can benefit both health sys-
tems and their clients worldwide.
Then, Chap. 11, is titled ‘Social Marketing, nudging policies and con-
sumerism: advancements through technologies from neuroscience’. 
Myriam Caratù reviews the state-of-the-art of consumer neuroscience 
inter-discipline, applied to the concerns of consumerism. At the same 
time, it answers questions such as: is this niche methodology destined to 
be the next main one in the consumer and consumeristic research? What 
are the challenges and the difficulties to overcome in this sense?

The final chapter of the book is reporting from the education sector. 
Chapter 12 is titled ‘Inclusive Online Collaborative Learning 
Environments in Vocational Education’. The authors (Hans Rüdiger 
Kaufmann, Anna Kurth and Lars Schäffner) propose a comprehensive 
model on online collaborative learning environments that holistically 
takes infrastructural factors, pedagogical principles, the interplay between 
technology and pedagogical principles, cultural differences and inclusion 
aspects into account to elevate the topic onto a more strategic level. In 
addition, the contribution presents the results of the still ongoing trian-
gulation research validating the initial model by both, qualitative research 
(focus groups in the project participating countries having applied con-
tent analysis) and quantitative research (survey with online question-
naires in the project participating countries having applied multivariate 
analysis).
