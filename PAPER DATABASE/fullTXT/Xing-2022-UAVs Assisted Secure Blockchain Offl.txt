Abstract—The security of distributed communications in
UAV rescue networks is promising to be provisioned by
blockchain technology. However, due to high mobility, distribut-
ed UAVs cannot timely connect to the backbone to synchronize
blocks, which can result in severe security issues (such as
Forged deposit address and Double spend attack). These issues
has been neglected in literature. This paper proposes a UAVs
assisted and incentive based blockchain offline transaction
scheme to address the above issues when UAVs and ground
users are offline. Particularly, we consider vehicle-to-vehicle
(V2V) charging transactions in disaster areas. First, we built
an offline channel between charging and discharging electric
vehicles (EVs), and then, we design an accountable assertions
based UAVs aided penalty algorithm to prevent various at-
tacks. Then, considering selfishness of users, we formulate
an incentive model based on Stackelberg game to encourage
EVs to participate to the offline V2V charging transactions.
Our simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme
obtain the optimal utilities for EVs, which outperforms the
conventional schemes.
Index Terms—Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), blockchain
offline transaction, electric vehicles (EVs), Stackelberg game.
I. INTRODUCTION
In the areas with frequent natural disasters, such as
earthquakes, mudslides, etc, the road infrastructures (i.e.,
base stations (BSs) [1], roadside units (RSUs) [2], etc.) are
broken, which will lead the paralyzation of communication
networks. Based on high mobility and flexibility, UAVs
are promising in building a decentralized communication
network in disaster areas to address the communication
dilemma through the air-to-air (A2A) communications and
air-to-ground (A2G) communications [3]. In such decentral-
ized network, communication security is important without
a central authority. Blockchain is a widely used security
method in recording data and behaviors. Current works study
blockchain technology in the UAV rescue network to protect
the data management in the infrastructure deficient networks
[4].
However, on one hand, due to the high mobility of nodes,
the topology of above decentralized network changes rapidly.
On the other hand, the cloud server is disconnected in
such area, the blockchain synchronization is difficult. As a
consequence, UAVs and ground users have to wait a long
time for the consensus and synchronization of blockchain,
which is impractical in such network [5], [6]. More seri-
ously, various attacks are easily implemented by attackers
in such case to threaten the security of users, e.g., account
forging attacks, double spend attacks, etc [7], [8]. The
blockchain offline transactions can address above blockchain
synchronization issues [9]. By locking deposits in the online
account, users can build the blockchain offline channels,
in which they can transact with others without waiting for
the blockchain consensus and synchronization. The offline
transaction records will be stored while the block verification
and generation processes will be executed after a period of
time [10].
In such offline transactions, users should take a risk of the
situation that they cannot obtain the correspond money after
a period of time, thus, users are not willing to participate
the offline transactions when they cannot obtain profits right
away. In this way, an appropriate incentive scheme is re-
quired to motivate ground users to participate the blockchain
offline transactions [11]–[13]. This paper focuses on the
case of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) charging transactions in
disaster areas, which is critical in such environments. For
the reason that in disaster stricken area, EVs that urgently
need to charge may face with the charging problem because
of the broken of charging station. The emergency power is
hard to be transmitted from the outside world to such area
since the road to the area from the outside world was cut
off. In this way, V2V charging is an appropriate solution,
which uses the Bi-directional DC-DC converters in V2V
technology for energy transfer between two electric vehicles
(EVs) [14]. EVs, with urgent need of charging, can continue
their journey. Besides, EVs, with extra power, can obtain
profits by charging other EVs.
To address the above problems, this paper proposes a
UAVs assisted scheme for the secure blockchain offline

transactions among EVs. First, considering security demand,
this paper designs a UAVs aided penalty algorithm, which
can efficiently verify the transactions and prevent various
attacks through the accountable assertions. Moreover, a
Stackelberg game based incentive model is established for
the offline transaction between charging and discharging
EVs, which can increase the willing of EVs in participating
the V2V charging. In this way, the optimal deposits change
in the offline channels can be obtained. Finally, simulations
are carried to verify the effectiveness of proposed scheme.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Section II outlines the related works. Section III introduces
the system model. In Section IV, the blockchain offline
transactions is introduced. The game based incentive anal-
ysis is formulated in Section V. Section VI evaluates the
performance of proposed scheme. and Section VII closes
this paper with conclusions.
II. RELATED WORK
Currently, many efforts have been made for UAVs aided
disaster rescue in wireless communication networks. Dong
et al. [3] train the UAVs based survivor detection in neural
networks, which can improve the inference time and accura-
cy. Su et al. [4] propose a data sharing framework based on
lightweight blockchain in UAVs aided vehicular networks,
which can realize the high-quality data sharing. Based on
the actively collection of the received signal, Demiane et
al. [15] design the UAV trajectory planning model to search
survivors in disaster areas.
Besides, blockchain offline transactions have been exten-
sively studied in recent years. Elkhalil et al. [7] present
an Offline signcryption algorithm in blockchain to protect
the security of interaction between users, which saves the
energy and computation cost. Thakur et al. [9] design a
decentralized social internet of things (SIoT) platform, which
is appropriate to large-scale networks, and can protect the
privacy of users. Tochner et al. [10] present an attracting
route based off-chain transaction framework to address the
denial of service attack.
Nevertheless, few works consider the effectiveness in
applying blockchain offline transactions in UAVs networks.
Our work use the UAVs as the verifiers in the blockchain
offline transactions to promise the effectiveness of transac-
tions, which is efficient in preventing the deposit forging
attacks and double spend attacks.
III. SYSTEM MODEL
A. Network Model
In the disaster area where the road infrastructures are
broken, as shown in Fig. 1. A set of UAVs U =
{1, 2, ..., u, ..., U} are deployed after the disaster. The UAVs
will execute various tasks such as detection, sensing, da-
ta collecting, life searching, etc. Since the charging sta-
tion is paralyzed after disaster, the set of charging EVs
C = {1, 2, ..., c, ..., C} lack of electrical charge. A set of

discharging EVs D = {1, 2, ..., d, ...,D} that have extra
power, and can provide it to the EVs in C by V2V charging.
B. Mobility Model
The set of UAVs U = {1, 2, ..., u, ..., U} are deployed to
execute the sensing tasks for the disaster rescuing as well
as to communicate with the ground nodes through A2G
link. Each UAV is responsible for a specific area and the
responsible areas of them do not overlap each other. UAVs
are equipped with sensors to execute sensing tasks, the three-
dimensional Cartesian coordinate system of the location of
UAV u at time slot t is denoted as Ltu = (xtu, y
t
u, z
t
u). The
flight altitude of UAV u at time slot t is denoted by ztu.
The average velocity of EVs in UAV u’s coverage is
denoted by v. According to the study in [16], the number of
EVs in the coverage of UAV u is considered to follow the
Possion distribution. The arriving amount of EVs in UAV
u’s communication range is denoted as λu. ou is the ratio
of EVs leaving UAV u’s communication range, the amount
of EVs in UAV u’s communication range can be updated by
nt+1
u =
(
λu + ntu
)
· (1− ou) , (1)
where ntu is the number of EVs in the coverage of UAV u
in time slot t.
C. V2V Charging Model
In time slot t, the charging EV c will announce the
power quantity requirement qtc,d to discharging EV d, which

satisfies
0 ≤ qtc,d ≤ min
(
Qmax
c −Qtc, Qtd −Qmin
d
)
, (2)
where Qtc and Qtd denote the power quantity of EV c
and d, respectively. Qmax
c is the total battery capacity of EV
c. Qmin
d is the reservation power quantity that d keeps for
itself. The state of battery of EV x is denoted by an indicator
function Γtx:
Γtx =

where Γtx = 1 denotes EV x is in the charging state. Γtx =
1
δc,d−1 denotes EV x is in the discharging state, δc,d is the
power transmission loss of the V2V charging between c and
d.
IV. BLOCKCHAIN OFFLINE TRANSACTIONS AMONG EVS
A. Security Issues to the Blockchain Offline Channels
Before using blockchain offline channel, an EV x should
offer the deposit with the amount of bitcoins Bx, it cannot
use such deposit before the expiry time Tx. To complete the
energy transaction using blockchain offline channel between
the charging EV c and discharging EV d, hashed time
lock contract (HTLC) is created between the charging EV
and discharging EV, which allows the timely execution
of contract [17]. However, the blockchain offline channel
between EV c and d may face with the following security
problems:
• Forged deposit address: Since the charging and dis-
charging EVs are offline, it is difficult for the discharg-
ing EV d to verify the trustworthiness of EV c’s deposit
address. In this way, a malicious charging EV may
forge a fake deposit address to participate in the offline
transactions which will harm the benefits of other users.
• Double spend attack: A charging EV may forge the
available amount of bitcoins in the deposit account. In
this way, it can illegally transact with the same sum of
bitcoins.
B. UAVs Aided Penalty Algorithm with Accountable Asser-
tions
We propose a UAVs aided penalty algorithm with ac-
countable assertions, as shown in Algorithm 1. Based on
the assumption and the definition in [18], we define the
accountable assertions of the blockchain offline channels as
follows:
• Generation of keys: The charging EV c will generate
the keys: Gen (c) → (PUc, PRc). PUc and PRc
denote the public key and private key of c, respectively.
• Assertion of charging EV: After offline transaction,
EV c will state an assertion which is denoted by
asstc = Ass
(
PRc, HTLCc,d, sta
t
c
)
, (4)
Ass () is a matrix that contains three tuples, where
HTLCc,d is the HTLC established between EV c and
d. statc =
(
Btc, B
t
c,d
)
is the statement to the available
amount of bitcoins in EV c’s deposit account before
and after the transaction, respectively. The assertion will
return to the output asstc.
• Verification of UAVs: By using the public key PUc
provided by EV c, UAV u will verify the validity of
asstc, denoted by
vertu,c = V er
(
PUc, ass
t
c, HTLCc,d, sta
t
c
)
. (5)
V er () is a matrix that contains four tuples, if the
assertion is verified validity, we have vertu,c = 1.
Otherwise, we have vertu,c = 0.
• Extract of malicious EV’s deposit: UAV u will share
vertu,c with other UAVs through the UAVs network.
statc =
(
Btc, B
t
c,d
)
and stat
′
c =
(
Bt
′
c , B
t′
c,d′
)
are two
adjacent statements of EV c in two transactions, and
t′ > t. If Bt
′
c > Btc,d, a conflict is generated. UAVs
in the network will inform other EVs to refuse the
transaction with EV c. Moreover, UAVs will execute
the extraction process to extract the private key of EV
c, and extract all the bitcoins in c’s deposit account.
The extraction process can be denoted as:
PRc = Ext
(
PUc, ass
t
c, ass
t′
c , HTLCc,d,
HTLCc,d′ , sta
t
c, sta
t′
c
)
. (6)
Our proposed algorithm can address above security issues.
On one hand, UAVs can detect the malicious user with a
forged deposit account since they have the deposit informa-
tion of users in the disaster area. On the other hand, an EV
is not willing to implement double spend attack for because
such attack will be recognized by the algorithm and the EV
will be punished by extracting all the bitcoins in its deposit
account.
V. INCENTIVE SCHEME WITH GAME ANALYSIS
A. Utility Formulations
We formulate the offline transaction between the charging
EV and discharging EV as a Stackelberg game to analyze
the optimal strategies and maximize the utilities for them.
The discharging EV d acts as the leader to determine the
optimal unit charging price ptc,d. Moreover, the charging EV
c, as the follower, chooses the power quantity to buy from
EV d. The utility of EV c at time slot t can be obtained by
Φtc = Stc,d − P tc,d, (7)
where Stc,d is the satisfaction of charging EV c with the
quantity of charging power it provides, which can be denoted
by
Stc,d = β log

where β is the satisfaction parameter of power quantity, qtc,d
is the power quantity EV c wants to buy from EV d. P tc,d
is the total charging price EV c should pay to EV d, which
is denoted by
P tc,d = γptc,dq
t
c,d, (9)
where pc,d is the unit charging price, γ is the price adjust pa-
rameter. Therefore, the maximization problem of the utility
of EV c can be denoted by

s.t. 0 ≤ qtc,d ≤ min
(

. (10)
The utility of discharging EV is related to the price it can
obtain from charging EV c, the transmission cost of V2V
charging, and the price it should pay for the verifier, which
can be obtained by
Φtd = P tc,d − Puc,d − F td, (11)
UAV u in the communication range of EV c and d is chosen
as the verifier, and the discharging EV d should pay the price
Puc,d to UAV u, which is denoted by
Puc,d =

where θ is the adjustment parameter, Λuc,d is the data size
of HTLC produced between EV c and d. In this paper, we
suppose Λuc,d is a fixed value. ϕtu,c is the data transmission
rate between UAV u and EV c. F td is the transmission cost of
V2V charging between the charging EV c and discharging
EV d, which can be obtained by
F td =
ωδc,d
1− δc,d
qtc,d, (13)
where ω is the adjustment parameter to the cost. In this
way, the maximization problem of the utility of EV d can
be denoted by

B. Stackelberg Game Analysis
We first analyze the optimal decision of the charging EV
c, the second order differential of the utility function of EV
c with respect to qtc,d is

Since the second order differential of the utility function

∂qtc,d
is monotonic

there are three cases need to be analyzed:
1) If the unit charging price is high enough, i.e., ptc,d ≥
βk
γ , since
∂Φt

for all ptc,d, we have

∂qtc,d
≤ 0. Therefore, we have
qt∗c,d = 0.
2) If the unit charging price ptc,d follows βk

)
∂qt∗c,d
=
βk
1 + kqt∗c,d
− γptc,d = 0. (18)
The optimal strategy of EV c on the power quantity is qt∗c,d =
βk−γptc,d

.

3) If the unit charging price is low enough, i.e., 0 ≤ ptc,d ≤
βk
γ(1+kl) , since
∂Φt
c(q

tion, for all ptc,d, we have
∂Φt

t
c,d)
∂qtc,d
≥ 0. Therefore, we
have qt∗c,d = l.
The considered Stackelberg game has a unique Stackel-
berg Equilibrium(SE) qt∗c,d of EV c as follow:
qt∗c,d =

0, if ptc,d ≥
βk

kγptc,d
, if βk
γ(1+kl) < ptc,d <
βk
γ
l, if 0 ≤ ptc,d ≤
βk
γ(1+kl)
. (19)
Next, we analyze the optimal strategy of the discharging
EV d, similarly, we will consider the following three cases.
1) High pricing by the discharging EV d, i.e., for ptc,d ≥
βk
γ , qt∗c,d = 0. We have
∂Φt
d(qt∗c,d,p
t
c,d)
∂ptc,d
= 0. Therefore, we can
conclude that pt∗c,d →∞.
2) Low pricing by the discharging EV d, i.e., for 0 ≤
ptc,d ≤
βk
γ(1+kl) , qt∗c,d = l. The first order differential
of the utility function of EV d with respect to ptc,d is
∂Φt
d(qt∗c,d,p
t
c,d)
∂ptc,d
= γl > 0, which means that the utility
function of EV d is strictly increasing. Therefore, we have
pt∗c,d = βk
γ(1+kl) .
3) Normal pricing by the discharging EV d, i.e., for ptc,d
follows βk
γ(1+kl) < ptc,d <
βk
γ , qt∗c,d =
βk−γptc,d
kγptc,d
. The second
order differential of the utility function of EV d with respect
to ptc,d is

)
∂
(
ptc,d
)2 = − 2ωδc,dβ
(1− δc,d) γ

)−3
< 0. (20)
Therefore, the utility function of EV d is strictly concave
since
∂2Φt
d(qt∗c,d,p
t
c,d)
∂(ptc,d)
2 < 0. The maximum value of the utility
function is the solution of
∂Φt

∂ptc,d

VI. SIMULATION RESULTS
In the simulations, we select an area of 200 square
kilometers. The number of UAVs deployed in the area is
between 50 and 200, and the number of EVs in each UAV’s
coverage is between 5 and 20. The remaining power quantity
Qtc of the charging EV at time slot t is changed between 1
and 5 kWh, where the total battery capacity of EV is set
as 30 kWh. Other parameters used in the simulations are
summarized in Table I. The proposed scheme is compared
with two conventional incentive schemes: random scheme
and auction scheme [19]. In random scheme, the discharging
EV selects a random unit charging price and the charging
EV randomly determines the charging quantity of power.
In auction scheme, a number of EVs will compete with
each other by the auction game, the EV provides the lowest
unit charging price is selected as the discharging EV, and
the charging EV randomly decides the charging quantity of
power.
Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 show the comparisons between the
proposed model and the other two conventional incentive
models. Fig. 2 depicts the utility of the charging EV while
changing the quantity of charging power. The utilities of
charging EV in both the three schemes increase with the
increasing of surplus power quantity in charging EV for
the reason that the EV has more patience to the charging
services. Moreover, the proposed scheme outperforms the
other two schemes because in the random scheme, the price

scheme, the auction will consume a lot of time in waiting
for EVs to join the auction which will waste power of the
charging EV. Fig. 3 illustrates the utility of discharging EV
vs. power transmission loss. The result shows that in all
schemes, the discharging EV will obtain higher utility with
a lower power transmission loss since it should pay less for
the power loss. Similar to the result in Fig. 2, the proposed
scheme can obtain the highest utility for the discharging EV.
VII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed a UAVs assisted assertion
and incentive based scheme for the secure blockchain offline
transactions among EVs. First, considering security demand,
we have presented a UAVs aided penalty algorithm, which
can prevent the blockchain offline transactions from various
attacks. Second, due to the selfishness of EVs, a Stackelberg
game based incentive model has been designed in the
V2V charging services, from which the optimal utilities of
charging and discharging EVs can be obtained. Moreover,
simulation results have demonstrated the effectiveness of
proposed model. For the future works, we will further
consider the deposit design and utility of UAV by analyzing
the interactions between the UAV and the charging and
discharging EVs.
