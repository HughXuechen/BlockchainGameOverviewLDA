With the development of blockchain technology, many new social networks based on blockchain technology have emerged. )e
unique consensus mechanism and incentive mechanism of blockchain technology makes the law of information propagation in
the new social network different from that in the traditional social network. Based on the information propagation characteristics
of blockchain social network, this paper considers the influence of opposing groups of opinions, incentive mechanism and user’s
conformity psychology in blockchain social network, and uses the evolutionary game to define the transfer process and probability
between states and puts forward a new information propagation model. )is paper analyses the influence of group density, state
transition probability, and incentive policy on information transmission trends in the network through simulation ex-
periments. )e comparative experiment with the traditional model shows that the model in this paper can describe the
propagation behaviour choices of different propagators under different incentive policies, which the traditional model
cannot describe. Using the model in this paper to analyse the information propagation of blockchain social networks can
effectively inhibit the propagation of inferior information and further build a good network public opinion environment.
1. Introduction
With the rapid development of Internet technology, many
social network services (SNS) have emerged, bringing great
convenience to people’s daily information acquisition. )e
continuous interaction of social network users makes all
kinds of information quickly spread in social networks. Its
huge social graph makes the spread and influence of in-
formation easily magnified. )ese characteristics have made
social networks an essential platform for individuals and
organizations to express public opinion and release infor-
mation. Building an information dissemination model based
on real networks can reflect the information dissemination
process in social networks and predict information dis-
semination trends [1–5]. It helps researchers better under-
stand information propagation laws and provides theoretical
support for other research based on information propaga-
tion. In the 1960s, Daley and Kendall proposed the DK
model [6]. In the research, they found a certain similarity
between information propagation and virus propagation in
society. )erefore, later information propagation studies
mainly refer to the ideas and methods of infectious disease
models or directly use existing models to study information
propagation. Classical infectious disease models include SI
model, SIS model, SIR model [7], SEIR model [8], other
propagation models are mainly based on the classic models
mentioned above. )e infectious disease model abstracts the
various populations in the process of virus transmission into
different state nodes and abstracts the infection and recovery
process of the population into state transitions between
nodes. )ese classic infectious disease models take a fixed
value as the probability of transition between states. )ese
characteristics enable infectious disease models to describe
the spread of viruses or information among the population
to a certain extent.
With the gradual popularization of blockchain tech-
nology, research on information dissemination based on
blockchain technology has also been carried out one after
another. A batch of social networks with blockchain as the

has been put into operation one after another. )is type of
social network uses blockchain to record the release and
dissemination of information in the social network so that all
users’ speeches are traceable and challenging to tamper.
Furthermore, this type of social network gives economic and
community prestige rewards to contributors and dissemi-
nators of high-quality content in the community. And it
punishes the creators and disseminators of false information
and spam. )ese characteristics make the cost of producing
and propagating information higher. Compared with users
in traditional social networks, users in this type of social
network pay more attention to their comments in the
community. )ey can view all kinds of information released
in the community more rationally, thus constructing a new
information propagation environment.
However, the traditional social network communication
model is difficult to describe the characteristics of infor-
mation communication in the blockchain environment.
)erefore, it is meaningful to study the propagation law of
the social network of the blockchain and construct a
propagation model.
2. Related Work
)is kind of social network based on blockchain technology
has attracted many scholars’ attention. Many scholars have
made prospects for the application of blockchain in infor-
mation dissemination. Swan M. [9] first discussed the ap-
plication prospects of blockchain technology in information
propagation. Ersoy O. [10] studied information dissemi-
nation in the blockchain and proposed a method that
combines routing mechanisms and incentive mechanisms to
improve information dissemination efficiency in the
blockchain significantly. Qiang Ma [11] and others took the
Steemit social network as an example to analyse the gov-
ernance model of network rumours based on blockchain
technology. Jia P. [12] used the social network analysis
method to explore the characteristics and laws of public
opinion information dissemination of specific blockchain
social networks and blockchain social networks and con-
cluded that blockchain social networks are scale-free
networks.
In addition, some scholars have conducted in-depth
research on the practical application of blockchain in social
networks. Le Jiang [13] designed a blockchain-based
framework for decentralized OSN, using blockchain to
provide central control services and separate storage ser-
vices, improving users’ control over their data, and solving
user privacy issues leak problem. Chakravorty [14] provide a
user-centric, blockchain-enabled social media network that
enables true decentralization, security, and traceability of
content distribution. In the literature [15], Barbara Guidi
gives an overview of the leading blockchain-based online
social media platforms, considers users as the system’s
central role, and then proposes a new model of blockchain-
based online social networks. Gyuwon Song [16] proposes a
blockchain-based social media notarization service, uses
blockchain technology to realize the real archive of social
media content and finally proposes a real-time messaging
scenario as a proof of concept. )ese studies have made in-
depth studies in the combined application of blockchain and
social networks. Scholars use blockchain technology to
improve the problems of user privacy data leakage, low data
security, high degree of social network centralization, and
difficulty in tracking data sources in traditional social net-
work frameworks. Furthermore, these real social networks
provide a practical platform for subsequent research on the
dynamics of information propagation in blockchain social
networks.
In the research of information propagation model, from
an empirical perspective, Dan Zhao [17] proposed a con-
ceptual model of public opinion information dissemination
in a blockchain environment based on blockchain and in-
formation dissemination. Based on network communication
and blockchain theory, Gengxin Sun [18] introduced an
income-risk matrix and proposed a public opinion com-
munication model for social networks in the blockchain
environment. ArquamM. [19] proposes a model for sharing
the information securely at the peer level based on block-
chain. )is model can detect the source of misinformation
and information dissemination nodes by applying block-
chain technology. Cui Z. [20] also believes that the block-
chain has changed the mode of social network information
dissemination. )is work optimizes the forwarding proba-
bility based on the literature [18], adds state nodes, and
proposes a new network information Propagation model
based on blockchain. However, most of the current research
focuses on analysing the application prospects of blockchain
technology in information propagation, improving the ef-
ficiency of information propagation in the blockchain, and
reducing the cost of information storage. Only a few studies
have proposed a propagation model for blockchain social
networks.
However, in the research mentioned above on infor-
mation propagation in social networks based on blockchain,
the following three issues have not been considered: (1)
opposite groups in blockchain social networks and their
relative density impact the choice of communication be-
haviour of other users. (2) What impact will the imple-
mentation of different incentive policies on the blockchain
social network platform have on users’ propagation be-
haviour. (3) )e state transition probability in the existing
propagation model takes a fixed value at each moment. Still,
the size of different groups in the network is constantly
changing, affecting the user’s choice of propagation be-
haviour, which will lead to transitions between states
probability changes dynamically. In order to answer the
above questions, in the research of this paper, we propose a
new information propagation model. Based on the SEIR
model, this paper divides propagators into two groups with
opposing opinions and calculates the state transition
probability of multiple groups at different times through
evolutionary games. )e difference between this paper and
traditional research is that some state transition probabilities
in information propagation are regarded as dynamic
changes rather than a fixed value in terms of state transition
probability calculation. Finally, this paper simulated dif-
ferent incentive policies in the simulation experiment stage

to observe their influence on user propagation behaviour
choices. )is article aims to establish a blockchain-based
social network information dissemination model while
highlighting the application prospects of blockchain tech-
nology in the direction of public opinion guidance and
governance to provide references for social platforms and
government departments.
3. Information Propagation Model in Social
Network Based on Blockchain
3.1. Characteristics of Social Network Information Propaga-
tion Based on Blockchain. Before establishing the propaga-
tion model, one should first understand how the blockchain
affects information propagation in social networks. )is
article explains the influence of blockchain on information
dissemination and user dissemination behaviour from three
aspects.
)e incentive mechanism, consensus mechanism, and
characteristics of blockchain that are difficult to tamper with
make the information propagation process in blockchain-
based social networks different from traditional social
networks. First of all, the blockchain is a decentralized
distributed ledger. Due to the technical characteristics of the
incentive layer in its infrastructure, each node in the
blockchain needs to perform data verification to reach
consensus and keep accounts. So, it needs to be designed
reasonably incentive measures to make each node’s interests
in the blockchain consistent with the overall consensus. )e
characteristics of this underlying technology are mapped to
the application level: various social network platforms based
on blockchain technology issue platform economic tokens
for incentives to high-quality content creators and dis-
seminators. )ese economic tokens can be converted into
legal currency through official exchange or offline transac-
tions by users. )is kind of incentive brings economic power
to platform users’ creation.)erefore, users should obtain as
many recognitions and token incentives from other users as
possible. When expressing their views, users will have a
deeper understanding of the background of the event and
find evidence to prove their views. While users have regu-
lated their behaviour, social networking platforms can also
adjust the token incentive policies to guide platform users
effectively.
Secondly, the consensus layer of the blockchain tech-
nology infrastructure uses the characteristics of blocks to
form consensus in a highly decentralized system efficiently.
In the propagation process, users in the blockchain social
network platform propagate information to a certain extent.
Users can pay for platform tokens to vote on a piece of
content to evaluate whether the content is high-quality (or
low-quality) information. Moreover, whether the content
should be presented first to allow more users to see it expand
its dissemination scope, thereby promoting high-quality
content to get the token incentives of the platform.
Finally, the data stored in the blockchain is traceable and
difficult to tamper with.)e blockchain uses timestamps and
digital signatures to ensure the stability and reliability of the
information stored in the blockchain.)e user’s propagation
behaviour and the content will be stored in the blockchain
and cannot be deleted. Even if the user deletes the local
record of a piece of information, the information will still be
recorded in other distributed ledgers. With this feature, after
receiving the information, other users on the social network
platform can preliminarily determine the authenticity of the
received information by querying the historical release
records and historical dissemination records of the user who
created (or propagated) the information.
3.2. Blockchain Social Network Information Propagation
Model. Based on the SEIR model, this paper considers the
opinion opposition groups in the blockchain social network
to introduce a new node state. Furthermore, this paper
considers the impact of economic incentives and punish-
ments on user communication behaviours through the
Bayesian game [21] and evolutionary game [22], redefines
the transition probability between states, and proposes a
propagation model.
Assuming that there is information T in SNS (T is
support or opposition information for a type of topic),
according to the actual situation of information dissemi-
nation in the blockchain social network, the nodes in the
SNS are divided into the following five categories: suscep-
tible node S (Susceptible), Wait and see node E (Exposed),
support node A (Advocates), oppose node O (Objector),
immune node R (Removed), support node A and oppose
node O are collectively referred to as an infected node I
(Infected). )e S node indicates that the user has not yet
touched the information T. )e E node indicates that after S
contacts the information T, a group is temporarily on the
sidelines to maximize its economic benefits. A node rep-
resents a node that agrees with the T after the susceptible
node contacts the information T and chooses to disseminate
supporting information. Node O represents the node that
opposes after the susceptible node contacts the information
T and chooses to spread the opposing information. R means
that the node is no longer affected by the information. )e
state transition process is shown in Figure 1:
Suppose S(k, t), E(k, t), A(k, t), O(k, t), R(k, t) re-
spectively represent the density of various nodes with degree
k at time t, and At any moment:
S(k, t) + E(k, t) + A(k, t) + O(k, t) + R(k, t) � 1. )e tran-
sition rules between each state are described as follows:
(1) When node S contacts the target information, S may
transform into node A with probability psa, or
transform into node O with probability pso, or
choose to wait and see temporarily due to economic
incentives and punishments, and transform into
node E with probability pse. Among them, psa, pso,
and pse are, respectively, called the support proba-
bility, opposition probability, and wait-and-see
probability of node S for information.
(2) After node E touches node A again or node O, it may
transform into node A with probability pea, into
node O with probability peo, or into node R with
probability per. pae, peo, and per are called support

probability, opposition probability, and direct im-
munity probability of node E.
(3) Node A transforms into node R with the probability
par, which is called par as the immunity probability
of node A to target information.
(4) Node O is transformed into node R with probability
por, and por is called the immunity probability of
node O to target information.
(5) When a node becomes node R, its state no longer
changes.

pcon is the probability that any random edge in the
network is connected to the node of the infected node.
3.3. Construct the Game Matrix. In the model described in
3.1, the state transition probabilities pei, peo, per, pir, and por
are affected by the social networks’ economic incentive and
punishment mechanism. In order to describe the propa-
gation behaviour of node E, node A, and node O under
economic rewards and punishments, this paper constructs
the game matrix based on the Bayesian game.
Assuming that nodeA, O, andE in the social network are
all bounded rational groups, the game matrix is constructed
according to the Bayesian game as shown in Table 1:
In the game matrix, x is the probability of node E
accepting amessage from an infected node. According to 1.1,
x is pea + peo, and 1 − x is per. y and z are the probability of
the proponents and opponents disseminating information,
respectively. When the infected person no longer dissemi-
nates the message, it will be transformed into an immune
node.
)e definition of each parameter in the game matrix is
shown in Table 2:
After node S or node E accepts the message, it trans-
forms into node I (A or O), pays the cost of voting c and
obtains it from the economic incentives provided by the
community according to the density λ and (1 − λ) of A and
O in all I Basic income λE, (1 − λ)E. Node I will obtain its
corresponding additional benefits when node I successfully
affects healthy nodes, expanding the scope of information
dissemination. At the same time, the information trans-
mitted by I may be regarded as inferior content, and I will
be punished accordingly, that is, the risk of punishment for
the information propagated by I. )e income of node A and
node O is related to their density in all I. When the density
of one party continues to decrease, the information it
propagates is eventually recognized as inferior information,
and its density will decrease. With the information Ex-
pansion of the scope of propagation, the penalty will be
greater than its benefits. On the contrary, the density of one
party continues to increase, and the information it prop-
agates is ultimately recognized as high-quality content,
which will help its density increase. )e gains will be more
significant than the losses.

4.1. 4e Behaviour Analysis of Node E and State Transition
Probability Calculation. For the node E among the game
participants, this paper set uE1 as the expected income when
the selected strategy is “Accept,” uE2 is the expected income
when the selected strategy is “Not Accept.” uE is the average
income when node E selects the above two strategies:
uE1 � (yλ − zλ + z)E − (y + z)c,
uE2 ≡ 0,
uE � xuE1 +(1 − x)uE2 � xuE1
� x[(yλ − zλ + z)E − (y + z)c].
(2)
Construct the replicator dynamic equation of the
probability when node E selects the strategy “Accept” [23]:
F(x) �

� x uE1 − uE( 􏼁,
F(x) � x(1 − x)[(yλ − zλ + z)E − (y + z)c].
(3)
(i) If (yλ − zλ + z)E − (y + z)c � 0, then F(x) ≡ 0, that
is, regardless of the ratio of the node E that chooses
“Accept” to the node E that chooses “Not Accept,” it’s
the strategy will not change over time. At this time,
per and pea + peo remain unchanged.
(ii) If (yλ − zλ + z)E − (y + z)c≠ 0, let F(x) ≡ 0, the
above formula can get x � 0 and x � 1 as the two
stable points of x. )at is, when no mutant chooses
the opposite strategy, the ratio of node E choosing a
specific strategy (stabilizing at “ Accept“ or “Not
Accept”) will no longer change. At this time, the
derivative of F(x) can be obtained:

� (1 − 2x)[y(λ − c) + z[(1 − λ)E − c]]. (4)
If y(λ − c)> − z[(1 − λ)E − c], then dF(x)/dx|x�0 > 0,
dF(x)/dx|x�1 < 0 , So according to the evolutionary stable
strategy (ESS) [18], x � 1 is the equilibrium point. When
node E makes a decision, it will tend to choose “Accept.”)at
is, the probability of node E choosing “Accept” (pea + peo)
will gradually increase, and the probability of choosing “Not
Accept” (per) Will gradually decrease, F(x) is the increase
rate of x [19]. If y(λ − c)> − z[(1 − λ)E − c], then
dF(x)/dx|x�0 < 0, dF(x)/dx|x�1 > 0 , It can be calculated that
x � 0 is the equilibrium point. When node E makes a de-
cision, it will tend to choose “Not Accept.”)e probability of
node E choosing “Not Accept” will increase and the prob-
ability of choosing “Accept” will decrease. At this time, F(x)
is the decrease rate of x:
nx � (1 + F(x))x0. (5)
x0 is the initial acceptance rate at time t.

when the selected strategy is “Not Propagate.” uA is the
average income when node A selects the above two
strategies.

(i) If x � (R/EA), then F(y) ≡ 0, that is, regardless of
the ratio of the node A that chooses “Propagate” to
the node A that chooses “not propagated,” its the
strategy will not change over time. At this time, par
remains unchanged.
(ii) If x≠ (R/EA), let F(y) � 0, the above formula can
get y � 0 and y � 1 as the two stable points of y.
Similar to node E，the ratio of node A choosing a
specific strategy (stabilizing at “Propagate” or “Not
Propagate”) will no longer change. We can get the
derivative of F(y):
dF(y)

� (1 − 2y) xEA − R( 􏼁. (8)
If x> (R/EA), (dF(y)/dy)|y�0 > 0, (dF(y)/dy)|y�1 < 0,
y � 1 is the equilibrium point. When A makes a decision, it
will tend to choose strategy “Propagate,” that is, the prob-
ability of A choosing “Propagate” will increase. In contrast,
the probability of choosing “Not Propagate” will decrease. At
this time, F(y) is the increase rate of y. If x> (R/EA),
(dF(y)/dy)|y�0 < 0, (dF(y)/dy)|y�1 > 0, y � 0 can be ob-
tained as the equilibrium point. When A makes a decision, it
tends to choose “Not Propagate,” that is, the probability of A
choosing strategy “Not Propagate” will increase. )e prob-
ability of choosing “Propagate” will decrease. At this time,
F(y) is the reduction rate of y:
ny � (1 + F(y))y0,
npir � (1 − y).
(9)
y0 is the initial propagation rate at time t.
4.3. 4e Behaviour Analysis of Node O and State Transition
Probability Calculation. For node O among the game par-
ticipants. )is paper set uO1 be the expected income when
the selected strategy is “Propagate,” uO2 is the expected
income when the selected strategy is “Not Propagate.” uO is
the average income when node O selects the above two
strategies.
nuO2 � (1 − λ)E − c,
nuO � zuO1 +(1 − z)uO2 � z xEO − R( 􏼁 +(1 − λ)E − c,

(i) If x � (R/Eo), then F(z) ≡ 0. Regardless of the node
O ratio that chooses “Propagate” to the node O that
chooses “Not Propagate,” its strategy will not change
over time. At this time, por remains unchanged.
(ii) If x≠ (R/EO), let F(z) � 0, we can get z � 0 and z �
1 as the two stable points of y. )e ratio of node O
choosing a specific strategy (stabilizing at “Propa-
gate” or “Not Propagate”) will no longer change. We
can get the derivative of F(z):
dF(z)

If x> (R/EO), (dF(z)/dz)|z�0 > 0, (dF(z)/dz)|z�1 < 0,
z � 1 is the equilibrium point. O will tend to choose strategy
“Propagate.” )e probability of O choosing “Propagate” will
increase. )e probability of choosing “Not Propagate” will
decrease. At this time, F(z) is the increased rate of z. If
x< (R/EO), (dF(z)/dz)|z�0 < 0, (dF(z)/dz)|z�1 > 0, z � 0 is
the equilibrium point. When O makes a decision, it tends to
choose “Not Propagate,” that is, the probability of O
choosing strategy “Not Propagate” will increase. )e prob-
ability of choosing “Propagate” will decrease. At this time,
F(z) is the reduction rate of z:
nz � (1 + F(z))z0,
npor � (1 − z),
(13)
z0 is the initial propagation rate at time t.
)rough the evolutionary game theory and the above
calculations, this paper can get the trend and function of the
transition probabilities per, par, and por at time t. )e
participants in the above game are node E and all infected
nodes I, so the changing trend of transition probabilities pei
and peo when node E selects “Accept” cannot be determined
only through the above calculation. When node E selects the
strategy “Accept”:
(i) If node E chooses to accept the information prop-
agated by A, it can be known that its income is λE − c
through the game matrix
(ii) If node E chooses to accept the information prop-
agated by O, through the game matrix, its income is
(1 − λ)E − c
λ is the density of node A in all nodes I at the current
moment, and (1 − λ) is the density of nodeO in all nodes I at
the current moment. )erefore, under the condition that E
selects “Accept,” its income is related to the density of A and
O among all infected nodes. Mapping to reality reflects the
phenomenon that bounded rational individuals in real social
networks will suppress their suspicion when facing popular

beliefs. )is phenomenon is called the conformity psy-
chology [24]. Youhong Wan [25] combined the initial
transmission rate of information and the propagator density
at eachmoment and described the influence of herd effect on
the probability of information transmission. Based on the
above existing research and the actual situation of this paper.

5. Simulation Experiment and Result Analysis
)is section first explored the topological characteristics of
social networks based on blockchain with actual data. )en,
this paper conducted computer simulation experiments and
analyses under different parameters. According to the be-
haviour analysis of game participants and the calculation of
state transition probability in Section 3, We know that the
incentive mechanism and people’s conformity psychology in
the blockchain social network will affect the propagation
behaviour of different groups. )e expected income of users
is related to their basic income E, propagation costs c, the
penalty risk of propagation R, and additional income of
propagation. And the density of different infected persons
affects their basic income and additional income. )erefore,
adjusting the above parameters will have an impact on the
density changes of various nodes. Due to the relatively short
information dissemination time, this article does not con-
sider the dynamic changes of the network scale in subse-
quent experiments.
5.1. Analysis of Topological Characteristics of Social Network
Based on Blockchain. Wenyi Xiao et al. proposed a Sean
model for content recommendation, compared with the CF
algorithm and other content-based recommendation
methods on the data set constructed on the blockchain social
platform Steemit, and achieved good results [26].)is article
uses its public Steemit user relationship data set to build a
complex network. )e network topology is shown in Fig-
ure 2. )e graph contains 7242 nodes and 273942 edges. )e
colour and size of the node represent the degree of the node.
If the colour of the node is darker and the size is larger, the
degree of the node is about greater.
In order to explore the topological characteristics of social
networks based on blockchain, this experiment used Gephi
software to analyse further the topological characteristics of the
network on this data set.)is experiment respectively generated
WS network, BA network and ER random network with a
similar number of nodes and the average degree to the complex
network formed by the blockchain mentioned above social
network. )eir average clustering coefficient and average
shortest path are shown in Table 3.
)is experiment can see that the average clustering co-
efficient of the blockchain social network is 0.060, which is
smaller than the average clustering coefficient of the WS
network. However, the two are still in the same order of
magnitude, which shows that the blockchain social network
still has a high clustering coefficient. In addition, the average
path length of a complex blockchain network is about 3.225,
which is approximately log N (N is the number of nodes).
According to the definition of the WS model introduced by
DuncanWatts and Steven Strogatz [27].)e blockchain social
network conforms to the characteristics of the WS network.
Figure 3 shows the degree distribution of the complex
network of the blockchain. According to the degree dis-
tribution graph, this paper examines the degree of fit of the
degree distribution curve and the power-law distribution in
the experiment to determine whether the blockchain social
network has scale-free characteristics. )e results show that
p value � 0.00 is less than the significance level (5%), so the
blockchain social network does not have prominent scale-
free characteristics [28].
5.2. 4e Impact of Node Density on the Information Propa-
gation of Blockchain Social Networks. In this experiment,
different parameters are selected to make the expected

return of the infected node greater than 0 or less than 0.
)en, in this experiment, different initial density ratios of
node A and node O are set, and the system evolution process
is shown in Figure 4.
As shown in Figure 4, no matter in which case, nodes S
and E will reach a stable state before t � 20. Among them, S
contacts the target information with the contact rate A(t) +
O(t) and transforms into A, O, E with the probabilities psa,
pso, and pse respectively, so it shows a continuous downward
trend in the whole evolution process. After S is transformed
into E, E will contact the information again with A(t) + O(t)
at time t. )e increasing amount of E is greater than the
decreasing amount, and the overall trend is increasing.
Approximately when t> 8, the density of A and O increases,
and the probability that E will contact the target infor-
mation again increases. )e increase in the density of node
E is less than its decrease, and the overall trend is de-
creasing and finally reaches a steady state. When the initial
density is greater for nodes A and O, the density when it
reaches a steady-state is also greater. )rough simulation
experiments, it is found that A(t)/O(t) ≈ 2.08 is the di-
viding line:
(i) When (O(t)/A(t))> (1/2.08), the density of A and
O are both greater than 0 when they reach the steady-
state. At this time, both parties will stick to their
opinions. Regarding the economic incentive mech-
anism of the blockchain, it can be seen from the
evolutionary game inference part of Chapter 4 that at
this time, nodes A and O will believe that their
expected benefits of persisting in propagation are
greater than 0. Because of the influence of this in-
centive mechanism, the probability that A and O
persist in propagating information will increase. It
can be seen that under the influence of economic
incentives, users in blockchain-based social net-
works have higher propagation enthusiasm than
traditional social networks.
(ii) When (O(t)/A(t)) < (1/2.08), that is, when the
initial density difference between the two parties is
significant, the A density of the larger initial density
is greater than 0 when it reaches the steady-state.
After node O persists in propagating information for
some time, since its income is less than the cost, the
density of node O will keep decreasing and tend to
zero. In the process of information propagation,
node A believes that the expected benefit of per-
sisting in propagation is greater than zero. In con-
trast, node O thinks that the expected income of
persisting in propagation is less than the cost and
risk of propagation. Affected by the economic in-
centives and penalties of the blockchain, the prob-
ability of node A persisting in propagating
information increases, while the probability of node
O persisting in propagating information decreases,
and the reduced probability increases as the density
of group O decreases. From (b), (c), (d) in Figure 4,
we can see that the smaller the initial density of node
O, the smaller its peak value (peak values are 0.16,
0.09, 0.04 in turn), and the time for the entire
network to reach the steady-state )e shorter (the
time to reach steady-state is 67, 43, 33, respectively).
Due to economic incentives and punishments, users
in blockchain social networks behave more ratio-
nally when propagating information. On the one
hand, it is easier to highlight high-quality infor-
mation in the social network, and on the other hand,
it can suppress the propagation of low-quality
information.
5.3. 4e Influence of State Transition Probability on Infor-
mation Propagation. )e density of S and E and the speed
and trend of change have an important influence on the time
for A and O to reach the steady-state and then influence the
time for the entire system to reach a steady state. It is
specifically embodied in the values of transition probabilities
pse, psa, pso, pea, and peo. Due to pea and peo are calculated
through dynamic change equations based on the expected
income of node E at time t, only the values of pse, psa, and
pso need to be adjusted. Set psa � pso and take the probability
pse � (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8), the changing trend of the density of
node S and node E with time is shown in Figure 5.
From Figure 5, we can see that the larger the value of pse,
the longer it takes for node S and node E to reach the steady
state. Because the actual probability of S transforming into A
and O is determined by the contact rate pcon and A(t), O(t),
and the actual probability of S transforming into E has
nothing to do with E(t). )erefore, the smaller the pse, the
slower the change of S and E, and the longer it takes to reach

a steady state. Moreover, because only S can be transformed
into E, the smaller pse is, the smaller the peak value of node E
in the evolution process.
5.4. 4e Impact of Incentive Policies on Blockchain Network
Information Dissemination. In the process of information
dissemination in the blockchain social network, the eco-
nomic benefits of nodesA, O, and E have a decisive influence
on their dissemination behaviour. )erefore, it is necessary
to study the communication behaviour of various groups
under different economic incentive policies. According to
the simulation results in 5.2 and 5.3, to highlight and
compare the changing trend of node A and node E, shorten
the time for the whole to reach steady-state, and facilitate
calculation, )is experiment select parameters
(O(0)/A(0)) � (2/8) and pse � 0.8 in subsequent
experiments.
In this experiment, the first incentive policy makes the
expected return (expected income minus expected risk) of
nodes E, A, and O always less than 0. )e changing trend of
each node is shown in Figure 6.
We can see from Figure 6 that because the total income is
less than the risk and the initial density of node O is small, the
expected return of node O is always less than 0. Hence, its
density decreases rapidly and reaches a steady state. Because

the initial density of node A is relatively large, the expected
income of node A can still offset its expected risk within a
period after the start of the propagation.)erefore, the density
of node A will increase during the period after the start of the
propagation. As the densities of nodes S and E continue to
decrease, the expected benefit of nodes A’s continuous
propagation also decreases, and ultimately it is less than the
expected risk. )erefore, the density of node A begins to
decrease after some time and finally reaches a steady state.
)en, the second incentive policy makes the expected
return of nodes E, A, and O always greater than 0. )e
changing trend of each node is shown in Figure 7.
It can be seen from Figure 7 that because the propagating
income of nodes E, A, and O is always higher than the risks,
the densities of nodes A and O will rise in a short period and
will not decrease, and eventually reach a steady state.
)e third incentive policy makes the expected return of
nodes E, A, and O may be greater than 0 or less than 0 at any
time during the propagation to the steady-state. )e
changing trend of each node is shown in Figure 8.
According to Figure 8: When the relationship between
the spreading benefits and risks of groups E, A, O is un-
known, the density of infected nodes with a relatively small

5.5. Comparative Experiment. )e economic incentives and
punishments of the blockchain social network make users
more cautious and rational in choosing propagation be-
haviour when receiving information. But the traditional
social networkmodel can hardly reflect this characteristic. In
order to highlight the advantages of the model proposed in
this article, this experiment selects the traditional social
network communication model without media in the lit-
erature [29], which has similar node states and state tran-
sition processes to the model in this article. )is experiment
compares this model with the model in this paper. It selects
the time required for the maximum spread of information
and the density difference of different propagators as
evaluation indicators.
)is paper takes the time required to reach the maxi-
mum range of information dissemination as an evaluation
indicator. )e longer the time to reach the maximum spread
range under the same parameter conditions, the longer the
time for users to think and choose the spreading behaviour
in the spreading process, instead of not thinking about it and
spreading it casually after receiving the information. It
shows how sane users in the network are when propagating.
)e probability Pse has an important influence on the time
for A and O to reach the steady-state. )at is to say, Pse
influences the time for reaching the maximum propagation
range. )e experiment takes Pse ∈ (0, 1), and the compar-
ison of the time to reach the maximum propagation range is
shown in Figure 9 Shown:
It can be seen from Figure 9 that regardless of the value
of Pse, the time for the model in this paper to reach the
maximum propagation range is always greater than the time
for the traditional propagationmodel to reach the maximum
propagation range. When the value of Pse is different, the
time for the model in this paper to reach the maximum
propagation range is at least 7% higher than the traditional
propagation model, and the maximum is 54% higher. It
shows that users spend longer and more rationally thinking
when choosing propagation behaviours after users receive
information. By comparing the time when the information
reaches the maximum spread range, it is shown that the
model in this paper can better express the influence of the
incentive mechanism of the blockchain-based social net-
work on the spreading behaviour of users compared with the
traditional propagation model.
In the process of model building, this paper uses game
theory to describe the impact of economic incentives on
users’ communication behaviour. In the model of this paper,
part of the propagation probability is a time-varying pa-
rameter. However, the traditional dissemination model does
not consider the influence of the economic incentives of the
blockchain. Its dissemination probability can only be set as a
fixed parameter during a simulation experiment of simu-
lating dissemination, which leads to the fact that even if there
are few disseminators of information at the beginning, the
information has a wide range of influence. )is paper
compares the maximum propagation range of information
in the traditional model and our model under different
initial parameters. )e results are shown in Table 4.
)e sensitivity of the traditional model to the change of
the initial parameters is relatively weak, and the maximum
propagation range of node O is the minimum of 0.3215 and
the maximum of 0.3694. When the initial density of node O is
0.01, the proportion of node O in all infected nodes is 0.1, and
its maximum density is 0.3147 under the propagation sim-
ulation of the traditional propagation model. When the initial
density of node O is 0.09, its maximum density is 0.3694
under the propagation simulation of the traditional propa-
gation model. It means that in a community with an initial
number of 10,000 people (assuming that the total number of

people in the community will not change dynamically) if there
are 900 people initially disseminating information o, there will
be up to 3,694 people disseminating information o in the
process of dissemination; When there are 100 people dis-
seminating information o initially, there will still be a max-
imum of 3147 people who will become the disseminators of
information o during the entire dissemination process. In the
model of this paper, when the initial density of node O is 0.01
during the whole propagation process, its maximum density
is 0.0360. When the proportion of node O among all infected
nodes is 0.9, it has a maximum density of 0.8996 during the
propagation process. It can be seen that if the influence of
economic incentives on the transmission probability is not
considered and the transmission probability is set as a fixed
parameter, the model will be less sensitive to the initial in-
fected person density. Eventually, there will be a phenomenon
that even though the initial values of the infected person are
pretty different, the final propagation range is not much
different. )e model in this paper effectively improves this
phenomenon due to the use of a partially time-varying
propagation probability.
Blockchain social networks use incentive mechanisms to
highlight high-quality information and suppress poor-
quality information. To a certain extent, the blockchain
social network can use its incentive mechanism to encourage
users to suppress the spread of inferior information. )e
suppression effect can be expressed by the density difference
of different information disseminators when the informa-
tion reaches the maximum dissemination range. Whether
the model can describe this effect is also an indicator to
evaluate whether the model is reasonable. In the blockchain
environment, due to economic incentives, users will be more
cautious in choosing the propagation behaviour rather than
propagating information casually when they receive it. And
when users frequently contact a particular type of opinion,
they are more inclined to choose to spread this type of
opinion. )us, the proportion of various propagators at the
beginning of the propagation will have an important in-
fluence on the propagation behaviour of users after con-
tacting the information. )is experiment selects the initial
density ratios of different types of communicators and
observes the density difference of different information
communicators when the information reaches the maxi-
mum spread range. )e comparison between the model in
this article and the traditional communication model is
shown in Figure 10:
When the maximum spread range is reached, even if the
density of inferior information propagators is initially low,
the scale of propagation of this type of information in the
traditional propagation model is still large. )e maximum
difference in the density of the two types of propagators is
0.054, and the minimum is 0.007. It is not easy to describe
the impact of blockchain’s economic incentives on infor-
mation propagation. In the simulation results of this model,
the maximum density difference between the two types of
information is about 0.866, and the minimum density dif-
ference is 0.18. It shows that the model in this paper can
better describe the highlighting or inhibiting effect of the
blockchain on different information than the traditional
propagation model.
)e above experimental results show that the economic
incentives given to users by the blockchain social network
can profoundly affect the propagation behaviour of users in
the social network. Economic income can significantly
stimulate users’ enthusiasm for information propagation.
)e economic punishment mechanism coexisting with in-
centives can also enable users to remain rational and sus-
picious when facing different information and not readily

in this paper can better reflect the advantages of blockchain
social networks than traditional communication models.
6. Conclusions
)is paper considers the impact of blockchain technology on
social networks based on the traditional social network
propagationmodel. It abstracts the opposition groups in social
networks into “support nodes” and “opposition nodes.” )en,
this paper uses the evolutionary game theory to define the state
transition probability and establish an information dissemi-
nation model based on the blockchain social network. )is
paper first analyses the influence of group density on the
information propagation of the blockchain network in the
experimental part. )en, it analyses the influence of the state
transition probability on the group density in the network and
the time required to reach the steady state. Finally, it focuses on
verifying the influence of the incentive policy of the blockchain
social network the role of social network users’ propagation
behaviour. )e experimental conclusions are as follows: (1)
)e unique incentive mechanism of the blockchain social
network can significantly enhance the user’s enthusiasm for
dissemination and highlight high-quality content. )e pun-
ishment mechanism enables users to maintain a certain degree
of rationality when choosing their propagation strategies and
curb the propagation of false information. (2). )e model in
this paper can control parameters to simulate different in-
centive policies and more intuitively describe the impact of
incentive policies on information propagation.)e application
of blockchain technology in social networks provides new
ideas for the governance of online public opinion. )e model
in this article can reference government departments to use
blockchain technology to governance and guide online public
opinion in the future.
It should be pointed out that this study has certain
limitations: (1) in the model of this paper, a small part of the
state transition probability still adopts a fixed value. (2) In
reality, the intensity of the incentives for users to disseminate
information on various social platforms is decreasing with
time. But this diminishing effect is not considered in this
article. Both aspects are issues that we need to consider and
resolve in the future.
