Abstract—Blockchain was originally developed to support
decentralized cryptocurrency applications within a single net-
work. However, the proliferation of blockchain technology has
led to the need of supporting transactions across multiple
networks requiring interoperability. Thus far, minimal analysis
has been dedicated to the interoperability scenario and in
particular the prevention of double spending attacks across
interoperable blockchain networks. In this paper, we propose
the use of neutral observers to monitor transactions that span
multiple blockchains and design a protocol that obviates the
double spending problem across interoperable blockchain net-
works. We show that the observers, can detect double spending,
while remaining honest to the protocol as it is more profitable
to them than colluding due to our proposed disincentivization
scheme. Leveraging Ethereum's smart-contract functionality,
we simulate our proposed disincentivization scheme and show
its cost-effectiveness.

I. INTRODUCTION
Blockchain [1] is a decentralized, distributed, public
ledger whose main strength lies in creating an immutable
ledger. Due to this transparency, blockchain technology
has been used in a variety of application domains. For
example, monitoring the flow of foods from farms to the
customer [2]–[6]. As blockchain technology has expanded to
other fields [7]–[11] and applications (e.g., smart-contracts),
there is an emerging need to create interoperability across
several different blockchain systems [12]–[15]. Note, this
may include a mix of public/permissionless and private/per-
missioned blockchains [16]–[19]. Architectures for provid-
ing interoperability or supporting crosschain transactions
focus on forming a trusted channel connecting two or more
blockchains to enable transactions [20]–[23]. These trusted
channels are prone to several types of attacks as it appears
to be a centralized system [24], [25].
Built around blockchain technology, decentralized crypto-
currencies [26]–[28] were developed to obviate the need for
trusting a centralized banking system. A known weakness
of blockchain based decentralized cryptocurrency is the fast
payment double spending attack [29] where a malicious
user or group of colluding users seeks to spend a digital
currency unit two or more times by exploiting the delays
in verifying transactions. The double spending attack has
been studied by a number of researchers [29]–[34] within the
context of a single blockchain network/system. Furthermore,
a variety of measures to mitigate the double spend attack
have been proposed, such as having a trusted third party
track transactions (e.g., notarized checkpoints). However,
double spending continues to be a problem as illustrated
by recent Ethereum Classic blockchain attack [35].
While interoperablility of blockchain systems has re-
cently attracted attention [23], [49]–[59], to the best of
our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to demon-
strate the scenario where double spending is possible in an
interoperable blockchain setting. Recent research suggests
incorporating observer nodes to detect double spending in
a single blockchain network [29]. However, this solution
does not include the possibility of collusion between ob-
servers. Here, we propose to use a combination of observer
nodes (within each participating blockchain), and policy to
enforce monetary constraints to disincentivize crosschain
double spends. Furthermore, we use game theory to show
that it is in a rationale observer's best interest to remain
honest to the system. Utilizing Ethereum's smart-contract
functionality, we simulate our proposed disincentivization
scheme, to investigate the cost-effectiveness of our proposal.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
Section II provides background on interoperable blockchain
and the assumed attacker model. Section III details the pro-
posed disincentivization mechanism. Section IV evaluated
the proposed mechanism using game theory and provides
the results of our Ethereum experimental implementation.
Section V presents the related works. Section VI provides
discussion on the proposal, and future work plans. Finally,
Section VII presents our conclusions.
II. INTEROPERABLE BLOCKCHAINS
A. Background on Blockchain
Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and an immutable
ledger. Whenever any transaction happens within a block-
chain network, a set of special nodes, called miners, listen
to that transaction. They compete with each other to solve
a computation-heavy puzzle fast enough by investing their
computing resources to create a valid block of transactions.

The typical structure of a block (as shown in Figure 1) in a
blockchain network includes a list of all transactions along
with a nonce, merkle root hash, hash of previous block and

With the increasing puzzle difficulty, it takes time for a
miner to solve a puzzle. Whenever a miner node finds a
solution to the puzzle, i.e. they are able to create a valid
block of transactions, they broadcast that solution to all
peer nodes. Verifying such a solution is straightforward.
Acceptance of a block is determined if hash of that block
has been included as previous block hash during formation
of a new block. In this way, all nodes, eventually reach to a
consensus (as demonstrated in Figure 2), known as proof -
of -work [26].

Ethereum is a second generation blockchain [39]–[41]. It
gives the user flexibility and platform to leverage the block-
chain functionality for creating and deploying decentralized
applications. It has two types of accounts: externally
owned account which is owned by the user, and contract
account which is owned by the contract. User creates
smart-contract depending upon the application they want
to build and deploys the smart-contract into the blockchain
network. Leveraging Ethereum's smart-contract feature, any
application can be build (Turing Completeness). We simulate
our proposed disincentivization scheme (as demonstrated in
Section IV (C)) utilizing this smart-contract functionality.
B. Trusted Interoperable Blockchains
Overview. With regards to design of an interoperable block-
chains, the usage of a trustee (intermediate trusted node) for
interoperation across two blockchains has been proposed
[24], [36]–[38]. A trustee is part of both the participating
blockchains which require interoperation between them. It is
assumed that the trustee holds sufficient balance on both the
participating blockchains and they transfer monetary inform-
ation across the two networks. Thus far the research has fo-
cused on providing users interoperability across blockchains
without consideration of the possibility that the user can
double spend the transactions. Thus, we need enforcement
in policy to penalize any dishonest behavior. In this regard,
participating entities need to deposit money in the pre-signed
smart-contract till the transaction gets confirmed in both the
participating blockchains for interoperation.
Requirement 1: usage of trustee services. A set of trustees
are selected which act as the forwarding agents across
blockchain networks. They transfer interoperable transac-
tions from one blockchain network to another. To operate
as an interoperable agent, each trustee gets enrolled with a
valid account in both participating blockchains.
Requirement 2: need for an interoperable channel. To
transfer the interoperable transaction across other blockchain
network, bidirectional channel is needed between particip-
ating interoperable blockchains.
Requirement 3: user's flexibility in choosing a trustee. To
transfer an interoperable transaction from one blockchain
network to another, each user needs the flexibility of choos-
ing the trustee from a set of available trustees.
Requirement 4: policy to penalize dishonest behavior. We
need a policy to penalize any dishonest behavior, and in this
regard, participating entities need to deposit money in the
pre-signed smart-contract till the interoperable transaction
gets confirmed in both the participating blockchains.
Thus, any trusted interoperable blockchains should con-
sists of the following components: (i) user enrolment service,
(ii) trustee enrolment service, (iii) trustee selection service,
(iv) interoperable channel, and (v) penalty service.
C. Attacker Model
Let us suppose, N1 and N2 are two blockchains which
are part of the interoperable blockchain framework. We
assume the presence of a malicious attacker clienta in
the first blockchain network N1. He intends to inflict a
double spend attack on the trusted interoperable blockchain
system by spending the same money twice. We also assume
that clienta holds several other accounts in N1. Let us
assume, user1 and user2 are two accounts which appear
as two different users but both are either possessed by or
in collusion with clienta. Let us also assume, user3 is
another account belonging to another user, clienth (honest
user). In this situation, we have assumed that the account
user3 is not possessed by malicious user clienta, rather it
is possessed by some honest user, clienth, which belongs
to the second blockchain network N2. clienta sends money
from user1 to user3 at time instance t1 across the network
37

to get some service from user3. However, after obtaining
the service from the honest user clienth, the malicious
user clienta spends the same money at time instance t2
(where, t2 = t1 + Δ) within the blockchain network N1
by transferring the money to another account user2 which
is owned by or in collusion with clienta. As the clienta
and clienth belongs to two different blockchain networks
(as pictorially differentiated with two different colors for
two different blockchains in Figure 3), there is no way for
honest user clienth to detect whether double spend has been
performed by the user clienta; thus, a successful double
spend attack can be performed by the malicious user clienta.
Pictorial demonstration of successful double spend attack on
the interoperable blockchain framework is demonstrated in
Figure 3. This figure as well include ledgers for two different
blockchains which starts with G.

III. PROPOSED DISINCENTIVIZATION MECHANISM
With regards to disincentivizing double spending attempts
across interoperable blockchain networks, we have incor-
porated the notion of observers. Every transaction sent to
a trustee is endorsed by observers, i.e. the trustee accepts
transactions which are only endorsed by the observers.
We assume that the trustee remains honest to the system
and does not double spend. The notion of an observer
was proposed in [29] to solve the double spend attack in
a single blockchain network. In [29] the observers were
implanted by the user and thus were trusted entity for the
user. However, in our proposed work, observer nodes are
implanted by the trustee in both blockchain networks. Usage
of single observer node for endorsement is not desirable as
the observer node can collude with the user and provide
wrong response to the trustee and help the user in successful
double-spending. Hence, we propose the use of majority
voter logic using an odd number of observer nodes (three
is used here) in each of the participating networks. The
response that the majority of observers submit is accepted by
the trustee. With the help of the proposed disincentivization
scheme, discussed next, we show via a game theoretic
analysis, that instead of colluding, the three observer nodes
prefer to remain honest.
A. Overview of proposed disincentivization mechanism.
Our approach incorporates three observers in each net-
work. These observers are responsible for detecting double
spending attempt while transferring monetary information
between networks. Possible responses are:
1) All three observers can provide the wrong response.
2) All three observers can provide the correct response.
3) Two observers can provide the correct response, and
one can provide the incorrect response.
4) Two observers can provide the incorrect response, and
one can provide the correct response.
Overview of the signed smart-contract between the ob-
server nodes and the trustee. Leveraging Ethereum's smart-
contract functionality, contracts are signed between the ob-
server nodes and a trustee. In the signed smart-contract,
monetary variables and predefined rules are established and
enforced. The trustee accepts the response that a majority
of the observer nodes provide. In order to encourage honest
behavior, money needs to be deposited in the smart-contract
by all of the participating observers. This deposited money
gets confiscated by the trustee from an observer node whose
response differs from the response that the majority of the
observer nodes provide. Monetary variables that are used for
policy enforcement are listed in Table I.
Symbol Objective
c Cost of computation for correct result.
do
Deposit paid by the observer in the smart-contract signed with
the trustee.
dt
Payment given by the trustee to the observer for providing
the correct computation (based upon the similar response
provided by majority of the observers).

Money deposited in the collusion contract by advoc-
ate (collusion-initiator) and all other advisee (collusion-
supporter). Here f signifies first secret contract, and a signi-
fies the game initiated by the advocate.
ba

they take part in collusion.
μ
Reward given to all the honest observer nodes by the trustee
for reporting collusion attempt.
fh
Money deposited in the honest collusion contract (i.e., con-
tract for report of collusion) by the observers (honest colluder
and honest advisee).
bh
Bribe given by the honest observer to the other colluder so
that they take part in honest collusion.
r
Extra reward provided by trustee for honest computation
based upon blockchain's data. However, this reward is given
to the observer at the discretion of the trustee.
Table I: Description of monetary variables specified in the smart-contract
The functionality of the smart-contract operation for the
proposed disincentivization mechanism is as follows:
• All three observer nodes and the trustee creates a signed
digital smart-contract.
• To participate in detection of double-spend attempts,
each of the observers deposits money do in the digitally
signed smart-contract.

• Trustee accepts as true the majority of the observer
responses.
• For computing the correct result (based on the majority
of the submitted responses from the observer nodes),
all the observer nodes whose response matches gets
remuneration dt from the trustee.
• An observer whose response do not match the final
outcome looses the deposit do.
• If the interoperable transaction does not require fast
payment, then the trustee can check the validity of
the transaction (i.e., whether the transaction has been
double spent or not) from the ledger of any randomly
selected node. Then based upon the trustee's discretion
each of the observer, which responses with honest
computation, gets an extra reward r.
Overview of collusion between observer nodes. Due to
the incorporation of majority voter logic, observers prefer to
form a group for collusion (Figure 4). Note, observers and
players are synonymous in our work. Out of three observers,
if one responds honestly, still he may lose the deposit if other
two observer nodes collude together to provide the incorrect
response. The possible situations are as follows.
• No Collusion: The observers respond with their own
computed value.
• Attempted Collusion: An observer tries to initiate
collusion with one or more observers. However, the
contacted observers decline to participate.
• Collusion: An observer initiates collusion with one or
more observers, that agree to participate. The observer
that initiates the collusion is termed the advocate and
any participating observers are termed as advisees.
To initiate collusion, observer involved in the collusion pro-
cess deposits agreed-upon money to the collusion contract.
For initiating the collusion with another observer, collusion-
initiator (or advocate) provide incentives in terms of bribery.
Upon successful completion of collusion, the participating
colluder-observer receives the deposited money and agreed
upon bribe; collusion initiator receives its deposited money
present in the collusion contract.
Overview on the solution for the collusion prevention
(i.e., report mechanism for the dishonest behavior). To
achieve the manifested goals (i.e., all the observer respond
honestly, and helps in double-spend detection), we need to
report any dishonest behavior that any observer may incur.
Out of collusion agreement in between three or less than
three observers, two observers create a secret honest collu-
sion contract with the trustee in this regard (as pictorially
demonstrated in Case-04 of Figure 4). Note, this honest
collusion is secret from the collusion initiator (i.e., collusion
advocate). If any dishonest collusion happens, these two
observers (as part of the secret honest collusion) sends the
proof of collusion to the trustee. Thus, due to the report
from two of the honest colluder nodes, payoff for attempting

collusion by the other observer turns out to be negative,
and they gets banned from participating in the endorsement
procedure anymore.
Even though, participating in collusion appears to be
lucrative initially from the observer's point of view, still
due to the chances of presence of a secret honest collusion
contract in between other observer, there comes the fear
of getting betrayed and losing its deposited money. Thus,
remaining honest to the purpose serves as the best option
for all three observer nodes.
Next section discusses in detail the evaluation on this pro-
posed disincentivization mechanism utilizing concepts and
approaches from game theory [42]. Alongside, Ethereum's
smart-contract based experimental evaluation indicates the
cost-effectiveness of our proposal on disincentivization.
IV. EVALUATION
A. Game Theoretical Evaluation
This subsection presents game-theoretical approaches and
analysis of the utilization for three observer nodes in a block-
chain. However, this analysis is applicable to other networks
as well (which are part of the interoperable blockchain).
Preliminaries on game theory. In each game table, for each
column, consecutive three similar shades specify the possible
decision path which is considered for finding the best
possible utilization by a player (here, player and observer
is synonymous). Utilization specified within a rectangular
box for three consecutive similar shades specifies the best
decision for a player among three paths.
For example, in Table II (c), for player-3, we are cal-
culating best possible path from nodes V13, V14 and V15
(shown in three consecutive similar shades) and among these
three, path towards V13 leads to best possible utilization.
For player-2, we are calculating best possible path from
nodes V13, V17 and V19 (shown in three consecutive similar
shades) and among these three, path towards V17 leads to
best possible utilization. For player-1, we are calculating
best possible path from nodes V17, V26 and V35 (shown in
39

three consecutive similar shades) and among these three,
path towards V26 leads to best possible utilization.
In each game table, terminal node with red color signify
the path that leads to the best possible utilization for all
the three players, i.e. it leads to equilibria for all the three
players. For each game table, utilization for each Playeri
is Ui, where Ui = Pi − ci for i = 1, 2, and 3. Pi
and ci signifies the payoff and cost of computation for
each of the Playeri. Cost of computation for the correct
response to validate whether double spend has happened
or not (irrespective of any specified rules as discussed in
Section III) is demonstrated in Table II (a).
Brief demonstrations of games. Each steps contributing
towards achieving the disincentivization rules are elaborated
below in a form of game. Total 7 games with game tables
(utilization matrix) and game tree are described concerning
our disincentivization scheme. Payoff for Game-1 is demon-
strated in Table II (b). However, original payoff for each
Playeri for all other games can be calculated back from the
demonstrated utilization table corresponding to that game
using Pi = Ui + ci, for i = 1, 2, and 3. Each game tree
demonstrates all possible decision paths for all the observers.
Paths that each of the observer node might take can be
obtained by level order traversal of the game tree. As there
are total 3 observer nodes and root of game tree starts with
v0, so leaf node starts from v13 and ends at v39.
Game-1. Considering majority voter logic, i.e. the response
that majority of the observers agreed upon, trustee sends
money dt to those observers; otherwise, observer's deposited
money do gets confiscated by the trustee. Utilization matrix
corresponding to this game is demonstrated in Table II (c).
Figure 5 demonstrates that path leading towards terminal
node V26 is more profitable for all the players. Thus,
we conclude that taking part in collusion leads to better
utilization for all the players present in game-1.

in Table II (d). As shown in Figure 6, path leading towards

in Figure 7, path leading towards terminal node V13 is

for all the players present into the game.

Game-4 (case-1 of collusion contract). Although game-3
demonstrates achievement of the desired result (i.e., honest
behavior from all the observer nodes), it does not consider
the possibility of collusion in between observers. Thus, if
one of the observer initiate collusion (we term collusion
initiator as an advocate), and another observer agrees to
that collusion (we term collusion supporter as an advisee),
then game-3 fails to provide the desired outcome. However,
game-3 and game-4 is equivalent if the advocate does
not initiate collusion, or if the advisee does not agree to
collude with the advocate. In all other cases, game-4 deviates
from the desired outcome which leads to game-3. Hence,
we require to update the payoff (i.e., the reward) in the

Added Reward: if advisee follows the agreed upon collusion,
it is rewarded with bribe ba, else its deposited money fa
gets confiscated. If advocate does not follow collusion and
advisee follows, then its deposited money fa is given to
the advisee. This game is demonstrated in Table III (b). As
shown in Figure 8, path leading towards terminal node V25
is more profitable for all the players. Thus, we conclude
that collusion leads to better utilization for both colluders
irrespective of the presence of third player into the game-4.

choosing player-2 for collusion initiation, advocate initiate
collusion with the player-3. Hence, game-4 and game-5 are

Figure 9: Game-5 shows path leading towards collusion is taken as it is more profitable
for majority of the observer.
Game-6 (case-3 of collusion contract). Here, the advocate
initiate collusion with both the advisee, compared to both
game-4 or game-5. Thus, they are essentially similar in terms
of functionality. Hence, the reward mechanism for game-6
is similar to that of game-4 and game-5. However, game-
6 is equivalent to game-3, if the advocate does not initiate
collusion, or if both the advisee does not agree to collude
with the advocate. If advisee-1 does not agrees to collude,
game-6 is equivalent to game-4, and if advisee-2 does not
agrees to collude, then game-6 is equivalent to game-5.
When both the advisee agrees to collude, then utilization
matrix for each of the player (for game-6) is demonstrated
in Table IV (a). As shown in Figure 10, path leading towards
terminal node V26 is more profitable for all the players. Thus,
we conclude that collusion leads to better utilization for all
the players present into the game.

Figure 10: Game-6 demonstrate that collusion leads to better utilization for all the

Game-7 (case-4 of collusion contract). Here, the reward
mechanism for game-7 is similar to game-6. Thus, essen-
tially both game-6 and game-7 are similar when both the
advisee agrees to collude. Henceforth, we require to change
the payoff in the payoff matrix, i.e., the reward mechanism
needs to be updated to change the game dynamics.
Added Reward: extra reward μ from the trustee is given to
both the honest colluder for demonstrating honest behavior.
Due to this extra reward, both the advisee prefers to create
a secret honest collusion contract in between them. The
utilization matrix for each of the player in game-7 is
demonstrated in Table IV (b). Figure 11 shows the flow
of secret collusion contract in between observers. Figure 12
demonstrate path leading towards terminal node V13 (final
desired path) is more profitable for all the players.
Thus, we conclude that remaining honest to the protocol
leads to better utilization for all the players (i.e., observers)
present in the game. Hence, double spending attempt across
the interoperable blockchain network can successfully be
disincentivized for all the rational observers.

B. Monetary Policy Enforcement
With regards to detection of successful double spend
attempt by the neutral observers, we demonstrate
disincentivization mechanisms for which monetary
policy needs to be enforced in the decentralized smart-
contract. These enforced monetary constraints are obtained
after rigorous game theoretic analysis of all the seven
games, and updated reward mechanism for each of the
games. These enforced constraints are listed in Table V.
Condition Enforced monetary constraints
1. r > dt + 2do + c
2. dt + do + r > c
3. 3fa + 2ba + c > dt + do + r
4. 2fa + ba + c > r
5. 2fh + bh + μ > 4fa + 2ba + c
6. 3fh + bh + μ > 2do + dt + 2fa + ba + c
7. 2fh + r + μ > 4fa + 2ba + c
Table V: Rules for monetary policy enforcement.
C. Experimental Evaluation
Leveraging Ethereum's smart-contract functionality, we
experimentally evaluated the effectiveness of our proposed
disincentivization scheme (described in Section III (A) and
in Section IV (A)) for the trusted interoperable blockchain.
We evaluate the effectiveness in terms of required gas, gas
costs, transaction fee, and monetary costs (in USD).
Setup. We perform all experiments on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
64 bit operating systems, 16 GB RAM, and Intel Core i7,
2.81 GHz machine. Accounts are created using MetaMask
[63]. To make all the accounts functional, we accumulate
ETHER [64] from the Kovan TestNet network [65]. Utilizing
the test network platform provided by Kovan TestNet [66],
we perform experimental evaluation.
Smart-Contract Implementation. To simulate the proposed
disincentivization scheme, we create four smart-contracts to
simulate: (i) framework (trusted interoperable blockchain),
(ii) agreement, (iii) collusion, and (iv) report mechanism.
These smart-contracts are deployed using remix [61], [62]
which is build for smart-contract deployment from the web
browser in the Ethereum based decentralized blockchain
platform. We simulate three observers, two users (including
two accounts that belongs to the attacker and another which
belongs to the honest user), and a trustee by creating total
seven externally owned accounts.
Findings. We find (as shown in Figure 13) that each of
the implemented and deployed smart-contract requires ap-
proximately 2 USD worth of gas [67] to operate effectively.
Here, prices of gas are consistent (0.000000022 ETH) for all
the deployed smart-contracts, and total costs changes due to
the variation of required transaction fee. This conversion is
performed with the exchange rate of 1 ETH = 165.82 USD.

of required gas value, transaction fee (in ETH), and total monetary costs (in USD).
V. RELATED WORK
Double spending has been a well known and difficult
problem to solve in the cyber world for several decades [43]–
[48]. In the blockchain ecosystem, all the work on double
spending along with the measures to tackle the same [29]–
[31] has been performed only on the Bitcoin-based single
blockchain, and no attention have been given to the double
spending problem across an interoperable blockchain [23],
[49]–[60]. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first
attempt to demonstrate the scenario where double spending
is possible in an interoperable blockchain and also proposes
a solution to tackle the same.
We argue that direct incorporation of the existing solu-
tions to tackle the double spend problem within a single
blockchain network, i.e. incorporation of one or more ob-
server nodes cannot be incorporated into the interoperable
blockchain as it does not include the possibility of collusion
in between observer nodes. We recommend incorporation
of three neutral observers in each of the participating
blockchains in the interoperable blockchain framework,

provided our proposed disincentivization mechanism is ad-
opted that makes the system resilient against collusion and
consequently resilient from the double-spend attack.
VI. DISCUSSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
The required assumptions, limitations, and discussions to
our proposal on disincentivizing double-spend attempt using
neutral observers are mentioned as follows:
• We propose disincentivization mechanism to safeguard
the trustee from being a victim of double spend attack
that the user might incur. Thus, we assume, trustee
remain honest to the system.
• Observer nodes can be chosen by the trustee from the
already existing blockchain network, or they can even
be deployed by the trustee to each of the participating
blockchains that require interoperation.
• Deployment of a node as the observer in a blockchain
network is more expensive than using the already
existing nodes as the observer. Thus, we recommend
selecting observer from the already existing nodes from
participating blockchains requiring interoperability.
• Due to the open, anonymous participation, anybody can
join the public blockchain network. Thus, trustee may
choose to appoint any node or miner as the observer.
• We assume, observer nodes are connected with the
interoperable blockchain network in a peer-to-peer way.
• Deployment of more observer nodes are costly. Thus,
we require to use as few observer nodes as possible. If
we choose only one observer node, it can collude with
the user. If we use two observer nodes, they can collude
together. Thus, we require minimum three observers.
• Anyone from outside or inside the blockchain network
can participate as the trustee, as long as they hold suf-
ficient money on both the interoperating blockchains.
• We have demonstrated the attacker model and pro-
posed disincentivization scheme considering only two
blockchains requiring interoperability to preserve the
simplicity in demonstration. However, our proposal is
applicable for any number of blockchains.
• Scalability of our proposed approach can be improved
by increasing the number of trustee. However, the
measure to achieve the same is out of scope of this
paper, and it is considered for future work.
• We consider the cross-blockchain transactions with
the same architecture (e.g. Ethereum and Ethereum).
However, it will be one interesting future direction to
investigate the applicability of our proposal on cross-
blockchains with different architectures.
Future Work. Additional future work includes: (i) analyzing
the behavior of irrational observer, and its consequence
on double spend detection, (ii) analyzing the behavior of
dishonest trustee, and (iii) investigating the applicability of
the proposed disincentivization mechanism on interoperable
blockchain without requiring trusted intermediatory.
VII. CONCLUSION
We present disincentivization mechanism to prevent
double spend attack across interoperable blockchains. With
rigorous game theoretic analysis, we claim that rational ob-
server remain true to the purpose of interoperation, provided
the seven analyzed monetary conditions are satisfied during
the determination of incentives amount. Additionally, utiliz-
ing Ethereum's smart-contract feature, we demonstrate cost-
effectiveness of our proposal.
