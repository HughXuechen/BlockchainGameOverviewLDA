Abstract—Blockchain has been progressively applied to various
Internet of Things (IoT) platforms. As the efficiency of the
blockchain depends on its computing capability, how to make
sure the acquisition of the computational resources and partic-
ipation of the devices would be the driving force. In this work,
an edge computing-based blockchain network is considered,
where the edge service provider (ESP) offers computational
resources for the miners. The focus is to investigate an efficient
incentive mechanism for the miners to purchase the compu-
tational resources. Accordingly, a two-stage Stackelberg game
is formulated between the miners and ESP. By exploring the
Stackelberg equilibrium of the optimal mining strategy under two
different mining schemes. The aim is to find the optimal incentive
for the ESP and miners to choose auto-fit strategies. Through
theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, we demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed scheme on encouraging devices
to participate the Blockchain.
I. INTRODUCTION
The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) will be the
driving forces of the development of the future information and
communication technology (ICT). Meanwhile, the blockchain
has evolved from the original digital currency to extensive IoT
applications due to its distributed, tamper-resistant, retrospec-
tive and transparent features [1]. It has a great potential to
provide a secure and efficient decentralized IoT paradigm. In
blockchain, a block contains specific data about cryptographic
transactions. In peer-to-peer (P2P) network, blockchain tech-
nology allows to operate applications in a distributed manner
without a trusted third party as intermediate media, which
would enable individual to interact with others in a verifiable
way. In general, the generation of blockchain involves two
processes: computing and releasing. Computing refers to the
process of solving the Proof of Work (PoW) by computing to
obtain a settlement or an unverified block and releasing means
that when miners successfully solve the PoW problem and then
report the result to blockchain network for verification. When
the verification is correct, the blockchain will reach consensus
and then obtain rewards. The users/nodes who participant in
the computing are also named as miners while the computing
for consensus is called mining.
To further realize the blockchain in the IoT, edge computing
can play a significant role. The miners with insufficient hash
power recent the computational resources from Edge Service
Provider (ESP). As we know, the computing capability is
the key to the security and efficiency of blockchain, how to
incentivize the miners to participate the blockchain process and
obtain the computational resources is of profound significance.
In [2], the authors present an action game architecture to
study the optimal profits of ESP and miners based on deep
learning. The authors of [3] design a novel approximation
algorithm and study how to maximize the social welfare of
blockchain network. There are also several works utilizing the
game theory on designing the incentive schemes [4]- [5]. The
authors of [4] propose to investigate the optimal profits of
ESPs and miners under different pricing strategies via game
theoretic approaches. The authors of [5] suggest a two-miner
model to find the strategy of hash power utilization and find
the Nash Equilibrium (NE) in the blockchain. Motivated by the
aforementioned observations, in this paper, we aim at propos-
ing a novel incentive mechanism for an edge computing-based
blockchain, in order to find the optimal purchase and pricing
strategies for the ESP and miners. The main contribution can
be summarized as follows.
In the considered system, to encourage the users to par-
ticipate the mining process and the ESP to provide the
computational resources, we aim to explore the relations
and interactions between two parties. The optimal incentive
mechanism is presented based on the game theoretic approach,
i.e. Stackelberg game, where ESP is the leader and user is the
follower. Two mining schemes are particularly investigated.
The first one is that after after successfully computing, the
miner will report immediately, and the other one is to re-
port strategically after successfully computing. Then we have
proved the existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium, and
apply backward induction to find the global optimal solution.
The proposed mechanisms can help both parties to obtain
the best benefits and essentially stimulate the development of
blockchain system. Numerical results demonstrate the effec-
tiveness of the proposed incentive mechanism.
II. SYSTEM MODEL
We consider a scenario where there is one ESP and N
miners. The set of miners is denoted as N . We assume
that price of computational resource for miner i is qi and
the purchase strategy of miner i is si. The set of price of
computational resource for miners is Q = {q1, q2...qn, ..., qN}
and the set of purchase strategy (purchased amount) is S =
{s1, s2..., sn, ..., sN} and si ∈ [smin, smax] where smin and
smax is the minimum and maximum computational resource
purchased by miner i, respectively. Meanwhile, we assume

the hash power proportion of miner i in the whole blockchain
network is αi, which can be expressed by αi = si/
∑
j∈N
sj .
During the computing process, we assume that the proba-
bility that miner i successfully solves the PoW problem is µi.
Considering the miner’s solution to the PoW problem follows
the Poisson distribution with a compliance parameter λ [5],
we can obtain µi = αie
−λti where the computing delay ti is
related to the block size πb of each block b and the computing
capability ςi. We can consider ti = ςiπb. Similarly, we assume
that the probability that the miner successfully announces the
solutions of the PoW problem from verification is νi. Also we
consider the miner’s solution to the PoW problem follows the
Poisson distribution with a compliance parameter γ, then we
have νi = αie
−γτi , where τi is the delay, which is also related
to the block size and computing capability. Also we assume
τi = ξiπb. For simplicity, we assume for each block, the size
is equal, which means πb = π. Meanwhile, the process of
verification would consume less computational resources and
shorter processing time than computing the PoW.
When there are new tasks and transactions, they are firstly
being verified. After successful verification, the task will
be published to the blockchain. If it is successfully solved
through general consensus algorithm, a new block will be
generated on a certain chain. We assume that the new block
would be generated at the beginning of the pseudo-genesis
block. For single rational miner i, there are generally two
effectively mining schemes of obtaining rewards. One is that
the miner can obtain the reward from single block generation
and the other one is from a chain of blocks or branched
chain. However, miner i may face the risk that the others can
release their results after computing before him. Thus, there
are two mining and reporting schemes: immediate reporting
after successfully computing (IR) and strategically reporting
after successfully computing (SR).
III. PROBLEM FORMULATION
A. Rewards
In the process of block generation, there are three types
of rewards for the miners: fixed reward, performance reward
and participant reward. The fixed reward Rf is the constant
reward for computing the newly generated block. For example,
for Bitcoin, a new block would be generated approximately
every 10 minutes and the bonus generated by the Bitcoin has
been halved every four years. Therefore, the fixed reward of
blockchain can be regarded as an attenuation function which
the half-life is T . That is Rf = Rmax
f
(
1
2
) t
T , where Rmax
f is
the constant reward from genesis block.
The performance reward Rp is related to the volume of
transactions contained within the generated block, e.g., the
size of each block. We denote it as Rp = rπ, where r is an
evaluation factor and π is the size of block.
The participant reward Rε,i depends on the degree of
participation in the computing process while the new block
is generated, i.e. Rε,i = εαi, where ε is an evaluation factor.
B. Stackelberg Game
In this paper, we investigate the profits for miners and ESP
by introducing a two-stage Stackelberg game. We define the
ESP as the "leader" and the miner as the "follower" in this
game model. In the formulated game, the utility functions
of ESP and miners in each stage can be described in the
following.
1) In the first stage, the ESP sets the pricing strategy Q =
{q1, q2...} and the utility/profit function is:
UESP (S,Q) =
N∑
i
si (qi − c), (1)
where c is the cost of providing resources of the ESP
which is related to power consumption and hardware loss,
etc.
2) In the second stage, the purchase strategy of miner i is
si and the utility/profit function of i is:
Ui(S,Q) = µiνiα
2
i (Rf +Rp) +Rε,i − qisi − ci, (2)
where ci is the cost of miner i.
Accordingly, at each stage, the problem can be formulated n
in the following.
1) In the first stage, the game of the ESP aims at addressing
problem (P1).
P1 : max
Q
Ui(S,Q),
s.t. qi ∈ [qmin, qmax] .
2) In the second stage, to maximize the profit of the miners,
the optimization problem at miner i is formulated as
P2 : max
S
Ui(S,Q),
s.t. si ∈ [smin, smax] .
C. Stackelberg Equilibrium
Based on our presented Stackelberg game model, we can
bring the definition of the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) as
follows.
Definition 1. Let Q∗ be a solution for P1 and S∗ denote a
solution for P2, Then, the point (S∗,Q∗) is a Stackelberg
equilibrium for the game if for any (S,Q) the following
conditions are fulfilled:
UESP (S∗,Q∗) ≥ UESP (S,Q) ,
Ui (S∗,Q∗) ≥ Ui (S,Q) .
We can see that from the definition, a two-stage iterative
algorithm is required to reach a SE. In the first stage, the ESP
sets a price of the resources. Then, the miners can compete in
a non-cooperative fashion in the second stage. After the NE
is reached, the ESP will reset the price based on the purchase
strategies of the miners. This two-stage update will iterate
until the conditions in Definition 1 are satisfied. In this paper,
we will apply the backward induction to find the SE of the
formulated game [9].

IV. INCENTIVE MECHANISM FOR MINING
A. IR Scheme
1) Game of Miners in IR: At first, we study the existence of
NE and then to provide the uniqueness. In the IR scheme, we
assume the miners can successfully announce the solution after
computing, which means νi = 1. To simplify the calculation,
in the follow, we use uesp = UESP (S,Q), and ui = Ui(S,Q),
and we assume
Rc = Rf +Rp. (3)
First, we will provide the proof of existence for NE under
the considered game model. After some calculations, we can
see that ui is strictly convex with respect to si. Accordingly,
we can arrive the following lemmas and theorems.
Lemma 1. The strategy set A of this game is a non-empty
convex and compact set, and the utility function is a continuous
function.
Proof. There are N pricing strategies of ESP in the first stage
and there are N purchase strategies of miners in the second
stage. Then the domain of all elements of this Stackelberg
game is AN×N . As there is least one strategy, the solution
set is a non-empty set. In addition, as we have proved, the
utility function is a strictly convex function. We can also see
the sets are convex sets. The domain of the set has its upper
bound, which means it is a compact set. Moreover, we can
easily observe that the function is continuous.
Lemma 2. The considered game is finite, i.e. the number of
miners and ESP is denumerable, and the strategy set is limited.
Proof. Due to the limited rewards in the generation of new
block, there would be a finite number of game participants:
ESP and miners. Although the demand sets of miners S =
{s1, s2...} and the strategy set of ESP Q = {q1, q2...} may
have infinite number of elements,as we have shown in the
proof of Lemma 1, both of them are bounded closed sets.
Theorem 1. If the complete information static game is finite,
i.e. the number of miners and ESP is denumerable, and the
pure strategy involved is limited, then there must be at least
one NE (S∗,Q∗), where the profits of ESP and miners can
reach optimum.
Proof. Similar proof can be found in [7], due to limitation of
the space, we omit here.
We have shown the existence of the NE and next we can
derive the uniqueness of the NE.
Theorem 2. The defined utility functions have the fixed points.
Proof. From Lemma 1, the strategy set A of this game is a
non-empty convex and compact set, and the utility functions
are continuous. Therefore, the defined utility functions must
have the fixed points [6]. Due to the limitation of the space,
detailed proof can be found in [6], so we omit here.
Theorem 3. The NE that obtains the optimal profits for miners
and ESP must be the fixed point of the utility function [9].
Proof. Similar proof can be found in [8], due to limitation of
the space, we omit here.
Next, we demonstrate the uniqueness of NE upon the
method of Standard function [9]. First, we present the defi-
nition of Standard function.
Definition 2. A general function f (x) can be seen as a
Standard function when it satisfy the conditions as follows:
• Positivity
∀x ∈ X, f (x) > 0. (4)
• Monotonicity
∀x1, x2 ∈ X, x1 ≤ x2, f (x1) ≤ f (x2) . (5)
• Scalability
∀ρ > 1, x ∈ X, f (ρx) ≤ ρ.f (x) . (6)
Accordingly, in the following, we will prove that the strat-
egy function is a Standard function. As we have shown in
Theorem 2 and Theorem 3, there are at least one NE and it
is the fixed point. Then we have
(s∗) = (f (s∗1) , f (s∗2) ...f (s∗N )) . (7)
For miner i, f (si) is the purchase strategy. Then we set
∂ui
∂si
= 0 and obtain
∑
j∈N
sj =
√√√√ (µRc + ε) ·
∑
j ̸=i
sj
q
. (8)
As we know
si =
∑
j∈N
sj −
∑
i̸=j
sj , (9)
and we can substitute (8) into (9) and get
s∗i = f (si) =
√√√√ (µiRc + ε) ·
∑
i̸=j
sj
qi
−
∑
i̸=j
sj . (10)
Then we can arrive the following lemma and theorem.
Lemma 3. The strategy function of miner i is Standard
function.
Proof. We will prove the lemma according to the definition
of Standard Function. As si is the purchase strategy of miner
i and we have given the expression of f(si) in (10), so we
can obtain that:
∀si ∈ S, f (si) > 0. (11)

Next, we assume that s1, s2 (s1 ∈ S, s2 ∈ S) and s1 < s2,
and after substituting it into (10), we can obtain that:
f (s1)− f (s2) = −

(12)
As s1 < s2, we can see
√∑
j ̸=1
sj −
√∑
j ̸=2
sj > 0, which
means f (s1)− f (s2) ≤ 0. Considering ∀ρ > 1, we have
ρf (si)− f (ρsi) = (ρ−√
ρ)
√√√√ (µiRc + ε) ·
∑
i̸=j
sj
qi
> 0.
(13)
Then, all the conditions of Standard function have been
satisfied.
Theorem 4. If the strategy function of miner i is Standard
function, and there must exist only one NE in the space of
strategy set [9].
We have proved the existence and uniqueness of NE of the
second stage of the game. The existence and uniqueness of NE
of the first stage can also be provided using similar approach.
Then we can obtain the optimal strategy of miners by apply-
ing Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and Lagrangian
method in the following steps.
From (8), we can obtain that:
qi
(µiRc + ε)
=
∑
i̸=j
sj( ∑
j∈N
sj
)2 , (14)
which equals to:
∑
j∈N
(
qi
µiRc + ε
)
= (N − 1)
∑
j∈N
sj( ∑
j∈N

)2 . (15)
After some calculation, we have∑
j∈N
sj =
N − 1∑
j∈N

Then we substitute (8) into (16), and obtain√√√√ (µiRc + ε)
∑
i̸=j

j∈N

Correspondingly, we can obtain the optimal strategy as fol-

 N − 1∑

µRc + ε
. (18)
2) Game of ESP in IR: In the first stage, the pricing strategy
of ESP depends on the service demand si. When we get the
NE of the second stage, then we can try to find the best
pricing strategy for ESP to obtain the optimal profits. After
substituting (18) into (1), one can arrive
uesp = (qi − c1)
(N − 1)
∑
j∈N
(
e−λtiRc + ε
)
qi
− (qi − c1)
(N − 1)
2
( ∑
j∈N
(
e−λtiRc + ε
))2
qi (e−λtiRc + ε)
.
(19)
Then, with some calculations, we can see that the uesp is
also a convex function with respect to the qi. Accordingly,
there must be a Q∗ which enables ESP to obtain the optimal
profits. The proof of existence and uniqueness are similar
to the ones in the second stage. With the optimal purchase
strategy s∗i of miner i, we will obtain the optimal pricing
strategy q∗i . In other words, under the combination of the
strategy (S∗,Q∗), both the miners and the ESP can achieve
the optimal profit, which is essentially the SE of the game. We
could then apply the KKT conditions and Lagrangian method
to solve the P1 to find the optimal q∗i .
In the IR scheme, the existence and uniqueness of NE
of each stage of the formulated game model can be proved
according to the presented theorems. The backward induction
method is used to solve the SE of the two-stage Stackelberg
game to obtain the global optimal solution. First, the optimal
purchase strategy of the miners in the second stage is solved.
Then we can obtain the pricing strategy of the ESP in the first
stage.
B. SR Scheme
When miners decide to participate in mining, some of the
miners may choose to temporarily hide their solutions of
complex transactions due to the their stronger hash power.
We assume rational miners who are with stronger hash power,
i.e, a certain level of hash power, would tend to utilize the SR
mining scheme instead of IR to get a better reward. However,
the miner who would like to choose SR will suffer a higher
risk as the other miners may report their solutions before it. In
this work, we do not consider the situation of "orphan"-like to
avoid the folk game with different branches. That is, although
the miner i can obtain a better reward when choosing SR, it
will suffer more risk to generate a chain of abandoned blocks.
Similar to the solution of the IR, we advocate the backward
induction and first study the second stage.
1) Game of Miners in SR: After successfully mining block
m, miner i who select the SR has the utility function that:

In the following, we also assume uSR
i,m = USR
i,m(S,Q). First,
we take the first order and second order derivatives of (20)
with respect to si, and we can obtain

(∑

( ∑

Then, we can conclude that ∂2u2
∂si2
< 0, which means the
utility function is convex. When we set ∂u2
∂si
= 0 and obtain
that:
2e−λti−γτimR1αi

(26)
Then we assume a content-specified function l (s), set the
equation θ =

∑
j ̸=i
sj = θ − si,
and
l (si) = 2mR1e

(27)
When we set the equation l (si) = 0, and we can see that
the discriminant is
∆ =

(28)
Meanwhile, under the condition of the axis of symmetry
si = εti−2mR1e
−λti−γτi t
−4mR1e−λti−γτi
> 0, that is the axis of symmetry
is the right of the origin. According to Vieta Theorem, it can
be known that the relation between the two roots is s1i s
2
i =
εt2−qt3
2mR1e−λti−γτi
< 0, then we can see that equation l (si) = 0
has only one positive root. Also, we assume s2i > s1i when
the domain of strategy is si ∈ [smin, smax], there must be only
one root
s2i =
−ϕi +

ϕ2
i + 8mR1e−λti−γτi (εt2 − qt3)

which makes condition

∂si
= 0 satisfied, and ϕi =(
εti −mR1e
−λti−γτiti
)
. Therefore, the optimal purchase
strategy for the miner who chooses the SR is found in (30).
Under the condition of shared hash power, we can conclude
α∗
i ≥ 2qis
∗
i
mR1e−λti−γτi + ε
. (31)
Then miner i can obtain optimal profit uSR

Then, we take the first order and second order derivatives
of (32) with respect to αi,

∂2uSR

Thus, for the miner who chooses the strategy to report the
solution strategically, higher the proportion of computational
resource leads to a higher reward.
2) Game of ESP in SR: In the first stage, we can substitute
the optimal strategy (30) into ESP’s utility function (1), we
can obtain (35). Then, we take the first order and second order
derivatives of (35) with respect to qi, then we would conclude
that the utility function uesp of the ESP is strictly convex.
Therefore, according to the previous analysis, there is a NE
of the game. According to (32), we can obtain the optimal
mining strategy S∗ for miner i and we could obtain the optimal
pricing strategy Q∗ for ESP by applying the KKT condition.
The method of backward induction is used to seek the SE to
maximize the profit of participants of the overall game.

Fig. 1: Computing capability vs. profits
V. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
To simplify the evaluation, we assume the miner has no
hash power, which means that all the hash power should
be purchased from the ESP. Some simulation parameters are
from [3]. Fig. 1 presents the relations between the computing
capability αi and the profit of the miner. It can be found that,
for the IR scheme, as we consider the probability of successful
reporting is 1, it has a better performance than the SR scheme.
It is mainly due to the fact that in the SR scheme, the miner has
to buy more resources due to the competition, which induce
higher cost. It can also be found that the profit increases as
the size of block gets bigger.
In Fig. 2, we plot the impact of the size of the transaction
in each block on the profit of the miners. In this figure, the
performance of IR scheme is presented. As we can see, as
the size of the block increases, the profits first become larger,
then decrease after reaching the maximum value. When the
size of block increases, the time and complexity of computing
PoW are incremental. Therefore, after reaching the maximum,
the cost dominates the performance of profit no matter what
kind of computing capability is considered. Moreover, when
computing capability increases, the performance get better.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have investigated the incentive mech-
anism under edge computing-enabled blockchain. We have
formulated a two-stage Stackelberg game model to maximize
the profits of both ESP and miners under the two mining
schemes. Then, the optimal solutions are presented and back-
ward induction is introduced to find the Stackelberg equilibria.

Performance evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed inventive mechanism.
