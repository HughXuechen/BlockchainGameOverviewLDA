Abstract. With the development of information and network technology, a
new type of manufacturing paradigm Cloud Manufacturing (CMg) is emerged.
In the CMg environment, geographically distributed various manufacturing
resources (MgSs) and manufacturing capabilities managed by different com-
panies are encapsulated as different manufacturing services under the support of
cloud computing, Internet of Things and virtualization technologies. CMg can
provide on-demand MgSs for the manufacturing tasks (MgTs) of different
customers in the network manufacturing environment. One MgT usually needs
different MgSs owned by different companies to form a coalition for working
together to finish it. However, being an autonomous entity, each MgS generally
makes decisions in light of its own interests, so it is difficult to maximize the
collective interests of the coalition. The cooperation among the MgSs in the
same coalition is an effective way to maximize the collective interests. Hence,
how to motivate MgSs to cooperate mutually is been paid more attention in
cloud manufacturing environment. In the paper, the evolutionary game theory
and the learning automaton are employed to model the decision-making process
of MgSs. And a punishment mechanism is introduced to incentivize the mutual
cooperation of MgSs. Furthermore, the Blockchain as a data storage structure is
adopted to record the behaviors of the MgSs to prevent from falsifying their
feedback. At last, the agent-based modeling is used to model and simulate the
process of MgSs working together. The simulating results reveal that the pun-
ishment mechanism is effective in promoting the cooperation among MgSs from
various perspectives.

1 Introduction
Cloud manufacturing (CMg) as an emerging service-oriented manufacturing paradigm
has been applied in many fields accompanied by the coming of the industrial 4.0, which
encapsulates MgSs and manufacturing capabilities into manufacturing services. Due to
the complexity of the MgT and the limitation of capacity of MgSs, one MgT usually
needs geographically separated MgSs owned by different companies to form a coalition
for working together to finish it with less time, less cost and higher quality [1–3]. To

realize the popularization and efficiency of CMg, the cooperation among the MgSs is
emphasized. However, the MgSs are usually selfish to avoid the cost of cooperation
and get the profits at the cost of others, which is difficult to maximize of the collective
interests. Hence, the cooperation among the MgSs is quite significant. Relevant ref-
erences have mentioned the importance of cooperation [1–3] but deeply studied the
cooperation among the MgSs are scant. The cooperation among rational and intelligent
individuals still remains a great challenge. The paper concentrates on the cooperation
among the MgSs by employing the tool of agent-based modeling and simulating [4].
The interests of each individual are not only depending on its own behavior but also
on the others’ behaviors in the same coalition. A suitable theory to analyze the conflict
of interests is evolutionary game theory, which has been a popular mathematical model
to analyze the problem from an evolutionary perspective [5]. The public good game is
multiplayer game in which several individuals decide simultaneously to choose the
behavior whether cooperation or noncooperation. The collected interests are multiplied
by a factor and equally distributed to every individual no matter what the behavior is
taken. It provides an effective theoretical framework for the dynamic and uncertain
cloud manufacturing environment to analyze the conflicts of interests among the MgSs.
In generally, the decision-making is performed with the stochastic imitation of the
more successful behavior [6–9]. The learning automaton [10] is a type of decision-
making method, which the individual learns the optimal behavior from the unknown
stochastic environment. The learning automaton has many applications, such as the
clustering [11], the prediction [12] and so on. In the paper, the learning automaton [10]
is applied to update the psychology of MgSs according to the response from the
environment and in turn to update the probability distribution of the behavior using the
response and the learning algorithm.
As a solution to the dilemma of cooperation, many aspects of punishment are
already investigated. The cooperators punish defectors based on the tolerance threshold
[13]. Reference [7] found that individuals tend to follow the strategy of majority and
put forward that the individual with the majority strategy will punish the minority
individual. Reference [9] referred that the conditional punishment and unconditional
punishment. Reference [8] introduced the third party supervision. On the one hand,
most of the previous literatures address the problem of cooperation on the regular
network (i.e., grid network) or on the irregular network (i.e., small-world network). In
the paper, the research is extended into the specific circumstances. The network is
dynamic and uncertain in the CMg, which brings the challenge to the research. On the
other hand, the strength of the punishment based on the historical behavior is rarely
considered in the existing literature. In the paper, the historical behavior recorded in the
blockchain that based on the time-effect is taken into consideration in CMg.
The following of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, the network model is
built to describe the relationship among the MTs and MgSs. And then the evolutionary
game theory is applied to analyze the conflicts of interests among MgSs. Next, the
incentive of the punishment is designed to promote the cooperation among the MgSs.
Finally, the learning automaton is used to decision-making for MgSs. In Sect. 3, the
results of the simulation and performance analysis are presented. Lastly, some con-
cluding remarks and further research works are pointed out in Sect. 4.

2 The Model and Problem Formulation
The simulation model can be divided into three parts: (1) Network model; (2) Game
model; (3) Behavior model. The model can be described as C ¼ ðG;B;UÞ, where
G ¼ ðT; S;EÞ means the network, T is the agents of the MgTs, S is the agents of the
MgSs and E are the edges that represent the relationship between the MgSs and the
MgTs. B denotes the behavior space of the MgSs. U defines the rules of decision-
making among the MgSs.
2.1 Network Model
The MgTs and MgSs form the relationship of service, which forms the complex
connections among them [2]. The relationship can be described using the bipartite
network [14] in Fig. 1, which is a branch of complex network [15]. T ¼
ðT1; T2; � � � ; TnÞ denotes a set of the MgTs, each of which is accomplished by a
coalition of MgSs S ¼ ðS1; S2; � � � ; SmÞ. One MgT has its own property Tj ¼ ðtj; gj; rjÞ
and the concert annotations are showing in Table 1. The Si ¼ ðMindi; cai; bi; ci; ctiÞ
represents the properties of the MgSs and the specific meaning of which shows in
Table 2. The decision-making of Si changes dynamically with the MgTs’ completion.
For the Tj, the Si has to undertake the cooperation cost ci when taking the behavior of
cooperation to make the maximize the interests of coalition but costs nothing when
adopting the behavior of noncooperation to maximize own interests.
Specifically, the formation of the network has the following four stages. Firstly, the
network is initialized with m0 ¼ 1000 MgSs and n0 ¼ 0 MgTs. n tasks entering the

CMg each time. Secondly, the service selection is mentioned by using the method of
the bet wheel of selection based on the number of the historical connections. And the
algorithm of the selection is as following:
Step 1: Calculate the number of historical transactions of the MgS:
p0ðSiÞ ¼ dðSiÞ ð1Þ
Step 2: Calculate the cumulative transactions of the MgS:
ppðSiÞ ¼
P
i2m
ðp0ðSiÞþ aÞ; dðSiÞ\ caiP

ðp0ðSi�1Þþ aÞ; dðSiÞ ¼ cai
8<
: ð2Þ
where a denotes the initial reputation value of the MgS and assuming as 2 in the
paper considering that every MgS has a chance to participate in the coalition of
MgT. When the number of the MgTs that the MgS is handling attains the maximum
limit, the algorithm ignores it and hence promotes the traversal of the MgSs.
Step 3: Calculate the cumulative probability:
pðSiÞ ¼ ppðSiÞPm
j¼1
ppðSjÞ
ð3Þ
The probability of the MgS selected is proportional to the cumulative probability.
Thirdly, the relationship of service between the MgSs and the MgTs is mapped to the
relationship among MgSs, which is facilitated to analyze the behaviors of MgSs. If the
MgSs have joined the same MgTs, there exists connection among them. Lastly, the
accomplish time of theMgT decreases to zero gradually and then theMgT exits the CMg.
2.2 Game Model and Punishment Mechanism
Once the network is constructed, the game model is constructed based on the game
theory. A realization of high-quality MgT requires the successful coordination of
efforts by multiple MgSs. However, the non-cooperators are widespread since the
MgSs are rational and selfish expecting to maximum their own interests but cost
anything. So each MgS has a tendency to take noncooperation behavior [19].
Evolutionary game theory in behavioral economics provides adequate evidence to
analyze social dilemmas and it has been a suitable model for studying the conflicts of
interests among the MgSs [16].
The public good game is a multiplayer game that meets the requirements of the
group action of MgSs in the same coalition, which is facilitated to analyze the conflicts
of interests. Hence, the paper adopts the pubic good game to analyze the problem. The
public good game is a model that the MgSs joining for the same MgT to form a
coalition as showing in Fig. 1. The interests of the coalition collected by the effort of
each individual are multiplied by a profit ration r, with 1 < r < N and then divided
244 P. Lou et al.
equally among the individual irrespective of their effors. So the profit of the MgS
according to different behaviors can be given as:
Q0
C ¼ r�nc
N � cQ0
D ¼ r�nc
N
(
ð4Þ
where c denotes the cost of the cooperation. N represents the number of the MgS
participating in the same coalition. nc denotes the number of MgSs in the same
coalition that adopts the cooperative behavior. In generally, the
Q0
C and
Q0
D mean the
corresponding profits of the cooperator and non-cooperator. The total payoff of the
MgS is accumulated from all the coalitions it participates.
Due to the existing of the conflicts of the interests, the non-cooperators is wide-
spread. Hence, the incentive mechanism is required to exerted to the non-cooperators.
The paper adopts the mechanism of the punishment. Most existing punishment
mechanisms fail to consider the timeliness of historical behavior and the corresponding
strength. To handle the change of punishment strength over the historical information,
an time decay index inspired by the forgetting curve [17] is added to the calculation in
Eq. (5).
bi ¼ 1 ; j ¼ k
eð�1=jÞ; 1 � j\ k
�
ð5Þ
The time decay index gives a higher weight to the current behavioral performance than
the past. Then, the calculation method of the strength of the punishment based on the
effect of time can be described as:
tru ¼
Pk�1
j¼1
tr ji bjPk�1
j¼1

; k 6¼ 0

: ð6Þ
where the tr ji is the historical transactional behavior, which is the number of the
cooperation divided by the total transactions. k indicates the number of the transactions.
Combining the punishment mechanism, the profit of each MgS is readjusted as:
Q
C ¼
Q0
CQ
D ¼ Q0
D �@ð1� truÞ

ð7Þ
where @ is the strength of the punishment.
In the process of recording historical transactions, the transaction information often
faces risks such as being tampered, which affects the trustworthiness of the data and the
effect of punishment. In addition, it is also necessary to consider how to acquire the
historical transaction information. The blockchain is a data structure that combines blocks
together in a chain and holds the properties of decentration. The hash value of each block
is attained by the contents of the block and the hash value of the previous block. And each
block contains the hash value of its previous hash value. And The hash value has the
Research on the Cooperative Behavior in Cloud Manufacturing 245
property of changing a bit of content to cause the hash value to change a lot. Hence, it
provides a data storage structure and guarantees the irreversibility and transparency of the
data. In the paper, the feature of the blockchain is employed to record the historical
transaction information and keep the information transparency. The Fig. 1 illustrates the
specific diagram of the manufacturing and the record of transaction information.
2.3 Decision-Making Based on the Learning Automaton
The scale of the CMg is getting larger and the collaboration among the MgSs is getting
more frequent. The behavior of one MgS may affect its neighbors and one non-
cooperative behavior will spread through the connection among the MgSs, which
results in a cascading effect. Meanwhile, the MgS is an autonomous individual, which
can be treated as an agent. Agents try to make decisions to maximum own interests
[18]. However, the agents are bounded-rational, which incurs some mistakes in
decision-making. Hence, the decision-making of the agents is of great importance and
depends on many factors. These factors essentially reflect the psychology of the agents.
The happiness of the agent increases when the payoff of the agent is higher than other
agents or higher than itself and the probability of the corresponding behavior increases.
Learning automaton is based on the response of the unknown stochastic environment to
update the probability distribution of behavior to learn the optimal behavior [10].
Hence, the learning automaton is suitable for the process of decision-making [10] and
the according principle is showing in Fig. 2.
Fig. 1. Illustration of the cloud manufacturing
246 P. Lou et al.
The learning automaton can be represented as a six-tuple \B; b; P;A;F;G[ . For
the convenience of analyzing, the behaviors of the agents are regarded as two types of
behaviors that is the cooperation or noncooperation. b 2 ½0; 1� represents the envi-
ronmental signal. P stands for the probability of the behavior. A is the learning
automaton algorithm. F : SðtÞ � b ! Sðtþ 1Þ is the state transition map. G : BðPÞ map
the current state as a function of the behavior and the probability of the behavior.
At each interaction, the agent updates the behavior from the behavior sets B using
the probability distribution of behavior P. The behavior is acted on the environment to
generate a stochastic environmental response b in turn to act on the agent to choose its
next behavior.
Based on the learning process described above, the probability of the agent’s
behavior adjusting at time tþ 1 can be described as:
PCðtþ 1Þ ¼ PCðtÞþ vbðtÞð1� PCðtÞÞ
PDðtþ 1Þ ¼ PDðtÞ � vbðtÞPDðtÞ
�
ð7Þ
where PCðtÞþPDðtÞ ¼ 1, v is the learning rate and represents the learning ability of the
agent. PCðtÞ, PDðtÞ is the corresponding probability of the behavior.
The agents often influence others and are influenced by others in their social
environment. In order to maximum their own profits, the agents have to make decisions
to coordinate their own behaviors with other agents. Considering the imperfect infor-
mation, the agent can not only know its own profit, but also know partial information
from the individuals who is familiar with it. Here, the average payoff from the
neighbors is adopted as the information from others considering the imperfect infor-
mation. And the w represents the learning weight and can be seen as the information
transparency. The w is larger, indicating that the information transparency is smaller
Fig. 2. The principle of the learning automaton
Research on the Cooperative Behavior in Cloud Manufacturing 247
since the more information is from themselves. Hence, the environmental signal can be
defined as following:
bðt) ¼ w� ðQðtÞ �Qðt � 1ÞÞ
maxfQðtÞ;Qðt � 1Þg þ ð1� wÞ � ðQðtÞ �Q
nðtÞÞ

ð8Þ
where
QðtÞ and
Qðt � 1Þ are the corresponding average payoff of the agent accu-
mulated from all the transactions at the current and last transaction.
Q
nðtÞ represents
the average payoff accumulated from all the neighbors at the current transaction.
Considering the society diversity and the individual heterogeneity, the agents often
have a prior cooperative belief to update their behaviors to cooperation or noncoop-
eration. Hence, the cooperative belief is elicited in the paper and the specific cooper-
ative belief of agents is adopted as in [17].

where v obeys the uniform distribution, that is v�U½0; 1�. The c represents the
heterogeneity of the cooperative belief. Considering that the belief of cooperation is
generally between 0 and 1, so the scope of it is scaled as following and the curve of
corresponding distribution is shown in Fig. 3.

3 Simulation
Agent-based modeling and simulating is a suitable tool to study the complex system
[19]. By combining the multi-agents and evolutionary simulation, the paper studies the
behaviors among the agents of MgSs. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of the learning
mechanism and punishment mechanism has been compared through evolutionary
simulation based on the Repast Simphony-2.4.
In the paper, the effects of the punishment on pubic good games in which inter-
actions are driven by the complex topologies on the environment of CMg are explored.
For the sake of simplicity but without loss of generality, all the simulations are per-
formed with tj ¼ 3; gj ¼ 5;cai ¼ 5;ci ¼ 1;cti ¼ 1 and m ¼ 1000.
After building the simulation model in Repast, the probability of the behavior of each
agent is sequentially updated when a full interaction ends. The average cooperative belief
of theMgSs characterizes the level of thewillingness or difficulty to cooperation, which is
the key factor to evaluate the effectiveness of the simulation. Hence, the response mea-
suring the average cooperative belief presenting at the steady state is investigated.
Based on the above model, the effectiveness of the punishment is verified from
various perspectives. Firstly, in Fig. 4, the characteristic average cooperative belief is
showed for different values of the strength of the punishment @. And then the simu-
lations are extended for higher value of learning weight w and the learning rate v, which
may shed light on the channels how the mechanism works.
In Fig. 4, one can see that the non-cooperators prevail with a slightly small value of
@ and the cooperators continually expand while the non-cooperators gradually shrink
for the appropriate degree of punishment as time evolves. For a fixed value of v, the
threshold of the punishment attaining the stable state of cooperation decrease with the
increase of w. For example, as v ¼ 0:2, the threshold of the strength of punishment is
required of 1 to achieve stable cooperation state when the w ¼ 0:2 and is corresponding
0.8 and 0.7 when w ¼ 0:6 and w ¼ 0:8. Actually, this is in line with what one could
expect. The information of transparency is lower with the larger w, indicating that the
agents have less information about the others and learn more about its own historical
transactional information. On the one hand, the more information the agent could attain
from others, which means that it has more learning signal for making decisions and
more chance to learn the signal of noncooperation to make own benefits maximization.
On the other hand, the agent learning by itself can be blind and cannot hold the global
information, which is more difficult for it to make the rational decisions.
For a fixed value of w, the higher the learning rate, the stable cooperation state is
achieved by lesser punishment. The learning rate represents the learning ability for the
agents. The most prominent scenario is when w ¼ 0:8. For v ¼ 0:2, the frequency of
the average cooperative belief starts boosting when @ ¼ 0:8. The cooperative belief
stands on a plateau of high value when @ ¼ 0:7 for v ¼ 0:5 and appears the same
phenomenon when v ¼ 0:8. However, there is a bit difference in the time to attain the
stable state, which v ¼ 0:8 is more faster than v ¼ 0:5 at @ ¼ 0:7.
In conclusion, the more information the agents can attain, the much easier for the
agents to learn the noncooperation signal. The better the learning ability of the agents, the
more promptly it leads to a plateau of cooperation with less strength of the punishment.
Research on the Cooperative Behavior in Cloud Manufacturing 249
Next, in order to intuitively understand why the stable state is not in complete
noncooperation or cooperation as the classic public good game, the average coopera-
tive belief as a dependence of the number of MgTs is investigated with stationary
w ¼ 0:5; v ¼ 0:5; r ¼ 2 showing in Fig. 5. It can be observed that the average
cooperative belief initially vibrates along with time and reaches the equilibrium after a
long time in the end. The different number of MgTs reflects the different relationship of
supply and demand in CMg. Obviously, it can be seen that the higher the number of
MgSs demanded, the stable state of the cooperation level is lower. On the contrary, the
stable state of the cooperation level is relatively higher. It is not hard to understand the
phenomenon. Since the CMg is demand driven network model and the network is built
by the preference mentioned above, there exists many idle MgSs when the demand for
MgSs is lower. So the chance for MgSs to participate the MgT and the probability of
interaction with other MgSs is small. These reasons drive them to keep the initial
cooperative belief unchanged. For the number of the MgTs is 200, the maximum
supply-demand ratio is 5:3 and the minimum is 5:1. So the average is 5:2, which leads
to the almost 30% of the cooperative MgSs in the manufacturing service pool and is
almost coincide with the simulation.
Finally, Fig. 6 shows that how the fraction of the cooperative belief CB is evolved
with the changing of the initial cooperative belief and the strength of the punishment at
different profit ratio. The results is calculated by doing 330 independent runs for 1000
times and take the average value of the last 20 stable states with fixed values of
w ¼ 0:5; v ¼ 0:5 and n ¼ 100.

(b) when v = 0.5; (c) when v = 0.8. Every colored line describes how the parameters evolve in
1000 times with the number of MgTs is 100, r = 2. (Color figure online)
250 P. Lou et al.
The turning point of the cooperative belief is different contrasting the three figures
in Fig. 6. The turning point is @ ¼ 0:8; 0:7; 0:6 in sequence when the average coop-
erative belief starts to rise. When r is larger, the agent is much easier to learn the
behavior from the coalitions with more cooperators. That is to say, the behavior of the
agent from the coalition with more cooperators spreads much faster comparing with
less cooperators since the cooperation can attain more interests than noncooperation.
On the contrary, the behaviors from the coalition with less cooperators are more
conductive to maximize their own interests when r is smaller. Moreover, the band is
much wider to reach a high level of cooperative belief when r is larger. When r = 2, the
band is narrow which is only from 0.9 to 1. When r = 3 and r = 4, it becomes wider
from 0.7 to 1 and 0.6 to 1, which means that achieving the same average cooperative
belief when reaches the equilibrium requires less strength of punishment as the r in-
creases. Hence, the larger r is more conductive to help the cooperators to resist the
invasion by non-cooperators. The result also conforms to the instinct of the real life,
which the individual is more willing to cooperate when the profit ratio of the MgT is
larger.
In addition, the initial reputation of the environment c also has some impact to some
degree. From the Fig. 6 (a–c), it can conclude that the c is inversely proportional to the
average cooperative belief, which is not hard to understand the phenomenon. The
larger the c is, the more widely distributed the initial cooperative belief is. That is to
say, the median of the initial cooperative belief is relatively lower when c is larger from
Fig. 3. Hence, the different distribution of the initial cooperative belief leads to different
point of equilibrium. Moreover, it also can attain high level of cooperative belief when
appropriate punishment is exerted, which proves the effectiveness of the punishment
from another aspect.

colored line represents for different number of MgTs in 200 times. (Color figure online)

In conclusion, by means of theoretical analysis and simulations, it has good per-
formance when adopting suitable strength of punishment.
4 Conclusion
The phenomenon of the noncooperation widely exists among MgSs in CMg. In order
to promote the cooperation among MgSs, the incentive mechanism of punishment is
exerted to the MgSs. Unlike previous works, the historical transactional behaviors
acting as a strength of the punishment is adopted to the paper. The process of the
decision-making is essentially the changing of psychology of the agents caused by the
environment. Hence, the learning automaton is proposed to update the psychology of
the agents according to the signal of the environment and in turn to make decisions
according to the psychology.
The paper verifies that such incentive mechanism of punishment has good per-
formance in promoting cooperation in some degree from multiple perspectives. Firstly,
different information transparency can have different thresholds of the punishment. The
more information the agents can attain from the environment, the higher threshold of
punishment the stable average cooperative belief requires. In addition, the learning
ability of the agents has some influence on the final evolution but relatively smaller
compared to the parameter of information transparency, which is much easier to learn
the signal of cooperation with fast learning ability. Moreover, the profit ratio of the
MgT is larger, the more conductive to boost the cooperation and less strength of
Fig. 6. The fraction of the average cooperative belief in dependence on c (the initial distribution
of the cooperative belief) and @ (the strength of the punishment). (a) when r = 2; (b) when r = 3;

punishment it requires to maintain the cooperation. Lastly, the initial reputation of the
environment has some impacts on the point of equilibrium to some degree. Even if the
initial environment is terrible, it can attain the high level of cooperation when applied
appropriate punishment. In a word, the effectiveness of the proposed incentive
mechanism is verified from multiple perspectives, which can significantly reduce the
number of the non-cooperators when the proper strength of punishment is exerted.
As future works, more complex issues will be considered into the model to deeply
understand of the impact of the evolution of the behavior in cloud manufacturing
environment.
