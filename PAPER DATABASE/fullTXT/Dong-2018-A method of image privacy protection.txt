Abstract--With the rapid development of virtual 
economy, infringement disputes in intellectual 
property rights (IP) such as film and television, 
games, creativity and so on frequently appear. The 
market urgently needs effective IP protection 
solutions. There are many problems in the 
traditional way, and blockchain technology has 
produced a subversive innovation in IP protection, 
and thoroughly solve the IP protection problem. 
This paper proposes a method of image privacy 
protection based on blockchain technology to 
protect the copyright of images in the network, and 
to deal with the privacy content in the image, so as 
to protect the rights and privacy of image owners. 
Key Words: IP, blockchain, privacy, image. 
.INTRODUCTION 
Blockchain[1] technology is a new 
distributed technology that uses block-chain data 
structure to verify and store data, it uses 
distributed node consensus algorithm to generate 
and update data, and uses cryptography to ensure 
the security of data transmission and access, and 
uses intelligent contracts composed of automated 
script code to program and manipulate data. 
Existence certification is the earliest 
blockchain certification service, which can be 
used to prove how digital assets are made through 
the network. The hash algorithm[2] proves the 
content of a file, and the timestamp proof the time 
that file was created. Using hash and timestamp, 
almost any document and digital asset can be 
identified. 
Blockchain is a permanent, open and unalterable 
global distributed database. Once the transaction 
is written into the block chain, it will always be 
stored in the database. This feature is a perfect 
solution for notarization and IP protection, and it 
may become an important function of the whole 
society in the future. 
This system will be built on the Ethereum [3]. 
Ethereum is an open source public platform chain 
platform with intelligent contract function. Peer-
to-peer contracts are handled through its 
dedicated encrypted currency, the Ether, which 
provides a decentralized virtual machine. Smart 
contract[4] is a computer protocol designed to 
disseminate, verify or execute contracts 
informationally. It allow for credible transactions 
without third parties. These transactions can be 
traced and irreversible. 
The purpose of this paper is to propose a 
method of image copyright management and 
image privacy protection method based on 
blockchain. Users can publish pictures in 
applications. This method uses blockchain 
technology to protect the copyright of photo 
authors. At the same time, this method can 
process the privacy part of the picture, such as 
face, etc. Users will not be able to get the 
complete picture without the permission of the 
author. The author can use the right of privacy, 
right of use and copyright to trade with others. 
The overall framework is as follows.

. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE 
1. Picture uploading 
The system is presented to users in the form 
of website. Users need to register an account on 
the website. 
After registration is completed, users can 
upload their own pictures. Here the server 
generates the hash value of the image file through 
the hash algorithm. If the copyright of the picture 
is not registered, the user can register his 
copyright of the picture. Otherwise, the user will 
be prompted that the copyright has been 
registered. 
The user can process the privacy part in the 
picture, and the system provides a tool for 
processing. Users can obscure the privacy part. 
When the picture is displayed in the user's 
personal space, the unauthorized user can not see 
the complete picture, only after paying the 
corresponding fee to obtain permission to see. 
This permission requires the photo author to be 
open when uploading the settings, otherwise 
other users will not be able to see the image 
privacy content. 
After uploading pictures, users need to set 
some parameters of the picture. The parameters to 
be set are as follows: 
� Whether permission to transfer picture 
copyright is allowed. 
� Whether the right to use pictures is allowed 
to be traded. 
� Do you allow other users to pay for private 
content? 
� If the parameter 1 is allowed, set the 
copyright price of the picture. 
� If parameter 2 is allowed, set the price of the 
right to use pictures. 
� If parameter 3 is allowed, set the privacy 
content to pay the cost. 
Among them, if users purchase the right or 
copyright of the picture, the privacy content is 
open to it by default. 
After completion, the remaining steps are 
completed by the system. Picture transactions are 
controlled by intelligent contracts. No manual 
intervention is required. 
In order to register the author's copyright on 
the block chain network, the author must pay a 
certain fee. In the block chain network, token is 
used as the currency of payment. The system is 
built on Ethernet block chain network, so the 
token here refers to ether currency. 
2. Picture preprocessing 
After uploading the picture, the system will 
preprocess the picture. 
First calculate the hash value of the image as 
the unique identification of the picture. The 
algorithm for calculating hash value is SM3 hash 
algorithm[5]. The processing of SM3 is: 
Step 1: Fill the image data with a fixed 
length of fingerprint, so that the length of the 
filled data is an integral multiple of 512; 
Step 2: Packet the filled information into 
groups of 512 bits, divided into N groups, that is 
 
Step 3: iterative compression to get the last 
hash value (hash value). 
 
If the information is divided into N groups,

the final hash value is obtained. Picture logo is the 
only one corresponding to a picture in the system. 
It is necessary to use picture logo in picture 
transaction or query. 
In the process of uploading pictures, if the 
author allows the pictures to be traded, the system 
will automatically generate intelligent contracts 
for the transaction, including the transfer of 
copyright, the right to use the transaction, the 
payment of image privacy content viewing and so 
on. All transactions will be strictly controlled by 
code. No intervention will be made to ensure the 
reliability of the transaction and save the 
cumbersome transaction steps. 
We need to carry on the privacy content in 
the picture, use the image processing technology 
to process. Ensure that the author's personal 
privacy is not leaked. After publishing a picture, 
the author can manually open access to some 
users so that they can view a complete picture 
without paying for private content. When the 
author does not open to see permission, the 
picture is only open to the author. Authors have 
the right to revoke the privacy status of the 
pictures and turn them into public pictures. No 
fees will be charged for the pictures after they are 
made public. 
The original image, the system generates 
different resolutions of the picture. The pictures 
displayed in the author's personal space are low 
resolution pictures, which prevent other users 
from illegally obtaining picture resources through 
screenshots and other means. The author can also 
customize the personal space to display the 
resolution of the picture. Hash values between 
images of different resolutions are associated. 
The copyright of derivative pictures is also 
recorded under the author's name. 
After processing the picture, the system 
initiates transactions to the block chain network 
and records the copyright of the author. After the 
block is confirmed, the corresponding 
information will be written to the database 
without tampering. The block chain network of 
this system uses workload proof mechanism pow 
(Proof of Work)[6]. 
3. Picture transaction 
Other users browse the pictures through the 
author's personal space. 
You need to view the privacy picture, then 
initiate the transaction, pay the corresponding fee 
and get the right. But only the user can view the 
picture, and the right of privacy can not be resold. 
When you want to get the right to use a 
picture for a profit, you have to pay the 
photographer for the right to use the picture. After 
the transaction is completed, users can download 
the original picture and use it. The right to use can 
not be resold. Other users should pay the 
corresponding fee to the copyright owner of the 
picture if they want to use the pictures. 
Users can also purchase the complete 
copyright of the picture, become the actual owner 
of the picture, with the right to complete the 
picture. After the user completes the transaction 
of the copyright of the picture, the original author 
of the picture will lose the copyright of the picture 
and can not use the picture to obtain the 
corresponding rights and interests, and the user 
who purchases the copyright of the picture will 
have the right to benefit from the picture and trade 
the right of privacy. The copyright of the picture 
can be changed again. The cost of various rights 
can be re calibrated by the copyright owner of the 
picture. 
After the user initiates the transaction and 
pays the cost, the transaction record is written in 
the block. The transaction is officially completed. 
Picture delivery will use asymmetric 
password to encrypt the content of the picture, the 
user holds his own key SK, the user's public key 
PK is published outside, after the transaction is

completed, the system will use the user's public 
key PK to encrypt the picture resources, the user 
receives the encrypted file, using SK to decrypt 
the file, get the picture. 
 
 
 
E is the encryption algorithm, M represents 
the picture plaintext, D is the decryption 
algorithm, and C is encrypted ciphertext. 
4. Picture query 
Because block chains are traceable. The 
system makes use of this feature to enable the use 
of pictures to be queried. Uploading pictures on 
the website allows you to check its copyright 
ownership and record of usage. You can also 
check the original author of the picture. 
SUMMARY 
The invention relates to a picture privacy 
protection method based on blockchain 
technology. First, the user uploads pictures to his 
personal space and sets the parameters of the 
pictures. Then the server preprocesses the 
pictures uploaded by the user and generates an 
intelligent contract for trading pictures. Then the 
server moves to the number based on block chain 
technology. The Word Money Network initiates 
a transaction to record the copyright of the author 
to the picture and save the transaction information 
to the database; other users view the thumbnail of 
the picture through the author's personal space, 
and complete the transaction by paying the 
corresponding amount of the smart contract. The 
invention uses the block chain technology to 
protect the copyright of the image author, and 
processes the privacy content in the image, so as 
to protect the rights and privacy of the image 
owner.
