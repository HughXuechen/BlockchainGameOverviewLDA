Abstract. Aiming at the problem of unqualified product quality, a two-level supply chain game
model under two modes is established. The backward induction method is used to solve the
decision variables to be analyzed and explore the application conditions of blockchain
technology. We found that the supply chain with the smaller application cost, the smaller
qualified rate of product quality and service quality, and the larger loss of reputation is the
most suitable to use blockchain technology. Product quality, service quality and market price
are improved. In addition, we also discuss the influence of sensitivity coefficient on product
quality and service quality. The smaller the cost coefficient of product quality and the larger
the importance of product quality are, the better the effect of product quality improvement is.
The smaller the cost coefficient of service quality and the larger the importance of service
quality are, the better the effect of service quality improvement is. It provides a reliable basis
for better quality decision.
Keywords: Supply Chain, Blockchain Technology, Product Quality, Service Quality.
1. Introduction
Supply chain quality management is an important way to achieve high quality products and services.
The traditional mode of supply chain quality management is mainly through the development of
contracts or models to restrict the quality behavior of enterprises. But it is difficult to solve the
bilateral information asymmetry problem, which leads to the unqualified supply chain quality.
Blockchain technology comes into being. It has the characteristics of decentralization and tamper-
proof. Reasonable use of blockchain technology can better drive the high-quality development of the
industry and supervise the quality behavior among supply chain enterprises [1]. Different from the
previous information sharing mechanism, the application of blockchain technology in product quality
supervision can effectively improve consumer trust [2] [3] established a blockchain platform for
supply chain product quality assurance and quality control.
The supply chain decision game considering blockchain technology has also become a new
research hotspot [4] [5]. It mainly focuses on pricing decision, [6] and [7] studied the optimal pricing
decision of supply chain in blockchain model. [8] studied the dual-channel pricing and channel
selection strategies under the two modes. [9] establish the game model between the enterprises in the
supply chain under the two modes. Considering blockchain technology, [10] built a green supply chain
game model. A few scholars consider the impact on product quality, [11] studied the impact of product
quality on blockchain participation. [12] found that manufacturers will produce high-quality products

under the blockchain model and the characteristics of blockchain technology were crucial to improve
the quality level of supply chain. There is a lack of research that considers both product quality and
service quality decisions in the blockchain environment.
Therefore, on this basis, this paper constructs a game model to explore the impact of blockchain
technology on supply chain quality level. Through numerical analysis, the application conditions of
blockchain are determined, and the influence results of sensitivity coefficient on quality level under
the two modes are discussed.
2. Model description and hypothesis
A two-level supply chain game model is established. The manufacturer produces the product and
determines its quality, while the retailer sells the product and determines its market price and service
quality. Therefore, in the case of cooperation, the model assumptions of adopting blockchain
technology and not adopting blockchain technology are as follows.
Hypothesis 1: Because of bilateral information asymmetry, manufacturers and retailers in the
traditional supply chain may cause unqualified quality due to unqualified quality behavior. As long as
one of manufacturers and retailers is quality not up to standard, it is nonconforming. Probability of
failure is 1 2(1 )  .
Hypothesis 2: Product demand is linearly correlated with price, product quality and service quality.
Hypothesis 3: The introduction of blockchain technology into the supply chain will increase the
fixed cost of blockchain use, and the fixed cost of introducing blockchain will be shared by the
manufacturers and the retailers.
Hypothesis 4: Supply chain quality is composed of product quality and service quality, and the
sum of importance of these two modules is 1, namely: 1 2 1 1 2 21;  l l q l q l q    .

3. Supply chain decision making in traditional mode
The information between the main bodies of the traditional supply chain is not symmetrical, so it is
impossible to supervise the quality behavior of enterprises, and it is easy to produce unqualified
products. Reputational loss caused by unqualified quality products is ( )v L [13]. On this basis, this
paper comprehensively considers the influence of product quality and service quality pass rate. The
right superscript N represents the traditional mode supply chain.
The demand function of the traditional mode supply chain is as follows:

5. Analysis of blockchain implementation conditions
Conclusion 3: The relationship between the equilibrium result of supply chain of traditional mode and
the qualified rate of product quality  1 the qualified rate of service quality  2 , and the utility
difference of unqualified products ( )v L , is as follows:

This shows that both product quality pass rate and service quality pass rate will affect market price,
product quality, service quality, market demand and supply chain profit in the traditional model. The
quality qualification rate will improve the market price, product quality and service quality, and then
increase the market demand for products, so as to improve the overall supply chain profit. On the
contrary, the loss of reputation of unqualified products will damage consumer trust, reduce product
market demand, and then reduce market prices, product quality, service quality.
Conclusion 4: The comparison between the market price, product quality and service quality under
the blockchain model and the traditional model is shown as follows:

This shows that the difference of decision variables in the two modes is greater than zero. Because,
blockchain technology can allow enterprises to monitor each other's quality behavior, to ensure
qualified quality behavior. Compared with the traditional supply chain, the application of blockchain
technology improves the market price, product quality and service quality.
6. Numerical example analysis
In this section, MATLAB will be used for example analysis to visually show the different results of
supply chain under the two modes. We assumes
100a  , 2  , 1.5  , 1 0.7l  , 2 0.3l  , 19w  , 1 2.5  , 2 1.5  , 40K  , 8v  , 1L  , 1 0.8  ,
2 0.8  , 4c  , 0.3d  .
The impacts of blockchain cost, product quality qualification rate and service quality qualification
rate, and product reputation loss on supply chain profit is shown in figure1, 2, 3.

Figure 3. The impact of product reputation loss on supply chain profit
According to numerical analysis, only when the blockchain cost is controlled within the range of
66.78 can the demand decrease caused by the loss of reputation caused by the low-quality products in
the traditional supply chain model be made up. When the qualified rate of product performance or
service quality is less than 0.97, the conditions for the supply chain to actively use blockchain
technology can be met. When the reputation loss of low-quality products exceeds 4.5, the overall
supply chain profit under the traditional mode is smaller than that under the blockchain. Through the
profit comparison between the two modes, it is found that when the application cost of blockchain is
smaller, the qualified rate of product performance and service quality is smaller, and the reputation
loss caused by low-quality products is larger, such a supply chain is the most suitable to use
blockchain technology, so as to satisfy the supply chain to actively use blockchain technology.
The influence of product quality cost coefficient and service quality cost coefficient on product
quality and service quality is shown in figure 4, 5.
Figure 4. The influence of product quality cost
elasticity coefficient on product quality
Figure 5. The effect of service quality cost
elasticity coefficient on service quality
Comparing figure 4-5, with the reduction of the cost coefficient of product quality, the difference of
product quality between the two modes becomes larger and larger. With the decrease of the cost
coefficient of service quality, the difference of service quality between the two modes becomes larger
and larger. It indicates that after the application of blockchain technology in supply chain, the smaller
the product quality cost coefficient is, the better the product quality improvement effect is. And the
smaller the service quality cost coefficient is, the better the service quality improvement effect is.
The influence of product quality importance on product quality and service quality is shown in

figure 6-7.
Figure 6. The influence of product quality
importance on product quality
Figure 7. The influence of product quality
importance on service quality
Supply chain quality level is composed of product quality and service quality, and the sum of their
importance is 1. With the increase of the importance of product quality, the difference of product
quality between the two modes becomes more and more obvious. With the increase of the importance
degree of service quality, the difference of service quality between the two modes becomes more and
more obvious. It indicates that the higher the importance degree of product quality, the better the effect
of blockchain technology application on product quality improvement. The greater the importance
degree of service quality, the better the effect of blockchain technology application on improving
service quality.
7. Conclusion and research prospect
This paper analyzes the equilibrium results under the two modes, and the main conclusions are as
follows:
1. Compared with the traditional supply chain, the market price, product quality and service quality
are improved under the blockchain model.
2. Blockchain technology is most suitable for supply chains where the application cost is smaller,
the qualified rate of product performance and service quality is smaller, and the reputation loss caused
by low-quality products is greater. In this way, the supply chain can be satisfied to actively use
blockchain technology.
3. The smaller the cost coefficient of product quality and the greater the importance of product
quality, the better the effect of product quality improvement. The smaller the cost coefficient of service
quality and the larger the importance degree of service quality have a better effect on the improvement
of service quality.
This paper makes clear the influence of application conditions and sensitivity coefficient of
blockchain technology on supply chain quality. However, this paper only studies the comparison of
supply chain decisions of the two modes in the case of cooperation, and subsequent research can be
further expanded to improve the high integration of blockchain technology and supply chain.
