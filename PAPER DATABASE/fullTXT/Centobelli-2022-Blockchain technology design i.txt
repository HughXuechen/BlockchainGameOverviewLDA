Abstract
Purpose – This paper aims to design, build and evaluate a blockchain platform in the accounting domain,
taking an ecosystem perspective. To achieve this aim, the research provides evidence for developing a
decentralised architecture rooted on blockchain technology, designing a proof of concept and modelling an
accounting blockchain-based system.
Design/methodology/approach – Moving from the analysis of previous literature and leveraging on the
design science approach, this paper provides a framework grounded on the main pillars of blockchain and
accounting functions, identifying technical and non-technical issues that must be addressed embrace
blockchain technology’s full potential.
Findings – We propose and discuss a conceptual framework for a blockchain-based accounting context,
moving from the identification of a typical accounting scenario. The framework is organised around three
scalable levels: the first level is a technological infrastructure based on a distributed database with peer-to-peer
storage; second, in the intermediate level, increasing control levels are assured through permissions and
validation and third, in the higher level, the system provides the integration of business and security
applications. The deployment of this system relies on a private network of nodes that validates transactions.
Practical implications –The proposed conceptual framework about blockchain development in accounting
allows closing the knowledge gap between blockchain developers and accounting experts by suggesting
technological and strategic issues for practitioners.
Originality/value – We provide practical guidelines to design and adopt blockchain in the accounting
domain.

resulted in radical innovation in the fields of currency, supply chain and knowledge
management (Centobelli et al., 2021a, b). Blockchain adoption in accounting is among the
most recent and promising fields, and blockchain is one of themost impacting technologies in
the current digital transformation scenario (Caldarelli et al., 2020).
The consequences of its adoption are disruptive, and they can be considered revolutionary
in the sameway that the internetwas (Smith andCastonguay, 2020; Dai andVasarhelyi, 2017).
As a distributed technological data system that ensures the certainty of transactions through
a distributed public ledger and a network of computers (Kwilinski, 2019; Cong andKlotz, 2018;
Morabito, 2017), blockchain allows all participants to access the same ledger records by
making all changes that occurred visible (ACCA, 2017; Kokina et al., 2017; Centobelli et al.,
2021a, b). Blockchain use in accounting, auditing and assurance is expected to contribute to
ensure the integrity of financial data, prevent financial reporting risks and outline implications
for external auditors and firms’ corporate governance practices (Smith andCastonguay, 2020).
According to Stafford and Treiblmaier (2020), one of the most intriguing information
accounting models is the distributed ledger based on blockchain. Blockchain’s application
has evolved from banking and financial markets to insurance and leasing, and from voting
systems and governmental services to collaborative practices and knowledge sharing
(Morgan et al., 2018; Tsanos and Zografos, 2016; Dai and Vasarhelyi, 2017). Recently,
blockchain has piqued the interest of academics and practitioners in the accounting field (Dal
Mas et al., 2020; Secinaro et al., 2021), where it is envisioned to transform principles and rules
due to its distributed and tracked data functions (Sinha, 2020; Kokina et al., 2017).
Blockchain is reviving interest in this field due to the convergence of various issues, with
theoretical and practical implications for auditing, assurance and accountability (Demirkan
et al., 2020). Its application in these domains reveals themore significant benefits of controlling
all recorded transactions, which is assumable as a paradigm shift in accounting practices and
theories (Fuller and Markelevich, 2020). This is due to the coherence of blockchain properties
in terms of dependability, truth and counterparty confidence, which can play a significant role
in accounting (Kwilinski, 2019). Blockchain provides complete information to all participants
and prevents operations from being tampered with, broken or altered as a distributed data
system. This is because transactions are registered on data blocks, and an encrypted copy of
the previous one is included (Kwilinski, 2019). Meanwhile, the presence of a distributed ledger
ensures that no information can be deleted or changed (Kokina et al., 2017).While the financial
services sector is already leading the way, using blockchain to re-examine processes and
functions that have been static for decades, the accounting sector is more conservative and
lags far behind in terms of blockchain exploration (Deloitte Development LLC, 2018).
Blockchain use in accounting reveals some unresolved issues and highlights some
barriers to its widespread adoption. The knowledge gap between blockchain developers and
accounting experts is one of the primary reasons for the lack of blockchain development in
accounting (Cai, 2021; Dal Mas et al., 2020). On one hand, accounting professionals and
academic researchers are unaware about blockchain concepts and infrastructures. However,
to transform business processes (including accounting), blockchain experts will require more
support from accounting professionals and academics in terms of specific business and
accounting knowledge. According to Bons�on and Bedn�arov�a (2019), scalability, flexibility,
architecture and cybersecurity are other outstanding issues. Blockchain in accounting has
the potential to transform the profession by affecting the accounting information system’s
database engine (Schmitz and Leoni, 2019). Because of the digital validation process,
accountants will no longer be the central authority of the process behind the transactions.
This is expected to produce benefits in terms of cost reduction, although some critical issues
persist in terms of data ownership and transparency (Secinaro et al., 2021; Kokina et al., 2017).
Despite the advancements mentioned above and the interest that this issue has recently
recalled, the full comprehension of the benefits of the adoption of blockchain in accounting

still needs clarification (Lombardi et al., 2021; Secinaro et al., 2021; Bons�on and Bedn�arov�a,
2019). Several critical issues remain unexplored and new theoretical interdisciplinary
research topics can be identified in the attempt to shed new light on this process of digital
transformation resulting from the adoption of blockchain in accounting. In this context, the
adoption of a sociological perspective of accounting is promising since it allows focusing
the attention on the different elements of the community of stakeholders populating the
ecosystem built around a blockchain platform. Indeed, embracing a sociological perspective
in accounting has demonstrated its usefulness for capturing the different dimensions of
accounting simultaneously, in terms of technological solutions, institutional and social issues
(Covaleski and Dirsmith, 2012). Based on these assumptions, this paper aims to answer to the
following research question (RQ):
RQ. What are the main benefits that a blockchain platform can bring to the accounting
domain?
Given that blockchain technology represents a ground-breaking solution in this field and
may radically change current accounting practices, it is worthwhile to examine this
technology’s potential and challenges in accounting from an ecosystem perspective and
determine the degree to which this domain may be transformed. To address the key effects
and influence of technical solutions, a conceptual framework for a blockchain-based
accounting context, moving from the identification of a typical accounting scenario is
proposed. The framework is organised around three scalable levels: the first is a technological
infrastructure based on a distributed database with peer-to-peer storage; second, in the
intermediate level, increasing control levels are assured through permissions and validation;
third, in the higher level, the system provides the integration of business and security
applications. The deployment of this system relies on a private network of nodes that
validates transactions. Then, leveraging on the design–science approach (March and Smith,
1995; Hevner et al., 2004), this paper aims to design, build and evaluate a blockchain platform
in the accounting domain, taking an ecosystem perspective. This methodology provides the
theoretical foundation for developing artifacts that can be used for system evaluation and
decision-making in line with a theory-building approach (Whetten, 1989). The design science
process adopted in this study follows the design–science research guidelines proposed by
Hevner et al. (2004). To achieve this aim, this research provides evidence for developing a
blockchain architecture design based on three phases related to: blockchain-based
accounting system analysis; proof of concept (PoC) framework design and deployment and
accounting blockchain-based modelling. Implications for practices prove that organisations
adopting blockchain must adapt their policies and procedures over internal controls and
counterparty risk assessment to address increasing regulation over the distribution of
financial data. At the same time, their audit committees must be prepared to address these
challenges leading up to financial statement preparation. Implications for theory highlight
technological and strategic elements to leverage for assuring effective blockchain use for the
accounting process by overcoming the infancy of this practice.
The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: Section 2 introduces the literature
background demonstrating the need for this study in the accounting body of literature. Section
3 presents the theory andanalytical framework, establishing the lens throughwhichweanalyse
the data and present our results. Section 4 describes the methodology. Section 5 describes the
results, and finally, Section 6 presents the discussion and conclusion of the research.
2. Literature review
2.1 Blockchain in accounting: An overview of an expected revolution
Blockchain is regarded as a new technology based on existing technologies. The ongoing
digital evolution resulted in the creation of blockchain, a peer-to-peer-based distributed
AAAJ

network that enables the exchange of value by registering and transferring it in a tamper-
proof manner (Bons�on and Bedn�arov�a, 2019). Blockchains are shared databases maintained
and verified by network participants, ensuring digital transparency and confidence in
information records in the absence of a trusted third party (Pilkington, 2016; Deloitte, 2016).
Despite its novelty, blockchain is the orchestration of three well-known technologies (the
Internet, private key cryptography and a protocol governing incentivisation) that, when
combined, result in a secure system that allows interactions without the use of a third trusted
party to facilitate digital relationships (Bauerle, 2017). In other words, this new ledger system
has the potential to enable a completely new level of information exchange both within and
across industries (Deloitte Development LLC, 2018). Blockchain-based applications have the
potential to change the way businesses operate. This type of disruption is known as a
“democratisation of trust” (Cai, 2021).
Whereas the financial sector was an early adopter, demand for the technology has
increased in recent years and comes from a variety of industries, including healthcare and
logistics. Accounting is one major business sector expected to benefit from the blockchain
features. This demand is unsurprising, given blockchain’s ability to enable decentralised
autonomous business models defined by self-governed programmes via decentralised
governance and collective consensus (Probst, 2016). In particular, blockchains may make it
easier to keep permanent and timely records of financial transactions. Its decentralised and
transparent nature also implies potential immutability, which means that financial records
cannot be changed ex-post, and if they are, the likelihood of detection is very high
(Andersen, 2016).
The blockchain poses myriad questions for its use in accounting and auditing (Cong et al.,
2018), and understanding why we need blockchain technology in accounting represents the
starting issue. The basic paradigm change is the idea of sharing data among organisations
instead of organisations keeping data within four walls. Every accounting transaction is
typically recorded in two or more organisations and updated independently (Cai, 2021). With
the evolution of online technologies and ubiquitous networks, customers already have the
ability to query inventory and automatically place orders. For example, vendor-managed
inventory allows for a better response to customer preferences at retail stores. Some
applications would clearly benefit from a secure data stream that may even be public in some
forms. For example, property records, vehicle registrations, security trades and government
procurement are already public information. Technology allows companies to book
transactions and almost immediately post them into public or private ledgers for
stakeholders’ use (R€uckesh€auser, 2017; Bons�on and Bedn�arov�a, 2019). Every transaction
has built-in risks, as well as controls that exist for the management of those risks. Blockchain
technology allows for the public display of transactions or public recording of encrypted
transactions (Kwilinski, 2019). It also benefits from multi-party validation. Because of these
advances, companies could provide real-time balance sheets, income statements, labour
reports, inventory records, patent applications, capital investments and a wide range of
internal information. This system would have relevance to some business partners, clients,
auditors and regulators in the value chain.
Nowadays, alternative technologies are used for accounting purposes, such as distributed
databases or enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. Peters and Panay (2016) and Dai
and Vasarhelyi (2017) compare blockchain with these alternative technologies, identifying
the similarities and the flaws that blockchain can solve. Blockchain can be considered a new
type of database used in conjunction with an ERP system. Dai and Vasarhelyi (2017) list
blockchain’s advantages compared to traditional ERP systems, pointing to decentralisation
(which can help prevent manipulation), preventing any unauthorised data changes and
a design that operates autonomously with little human intervention. This aspect brings
the possibility of major disruption to core ERP systems by a new generation of directly

cloud-based systems that enhances and expands ERP systems’ capacity. In addition to the
evolution or potential disruption of corporate-owned systems, a new model of “shared
trustless databases” has been developed and is known as a blockchain (Nakamoto, 2008;
Dai and Vasarhelyi, 2017). A blockchain is a different paradigm where entities keep data in
external stores and share these with partners in the value chain (Dai and Vasarhelyi, 2017).
Blockchain changes the management of transactions (Carlin, 2018; Dai and Vasarhelyi,
2017), and for this reason, blockchain can be interpreted as both an opportunity and a threat.
For instance, Deloitte has released its first software platform, Rubix, that allows applications
to be built on top of blockchain infrastructure. Rubix has four application areas: reconciliation
(automate financial reconciliations among internal departments of a company or with trading
partners), audit (obtain real-time assurance on components of financial statements and lessen
the reliance on an auditor), land registry (digitise and decentralise a jurisdiction’s property
deed transfers while eliminating the possibility of corruption) and loyalty points (create a
loyalty points program that is more cost-efficient and allows for added features and insights
for customers). Deloitte clients can use the platform for every need, while the company can
enhance the automation of some internal auditing processes. KPMG has also developed its
digital ledger services in collaboration with Microsoft to seize blockchain potential in the
financial services industry, healthcare and the public sector. It allows faster and more secure
transactions, automates back-office operations and reduces costs (KPMG, 2017). Ernst and
Young launched the EY Ops Chain, described as a set of applications and services (such as
payments, invoicing, inventory information, pricing and digital contract integration) that can
include digital contracts, shared inventory and logistics information, pricing, invoicing and
payments (Prisco, 2017).
On the one hand, some authors claim that blockchain has the potential tomake accounting
information more trustworthy and timelier by providing a better alternative to current
accounting and auditing systems (e.g. Coyne andMcMickle, 2017; Kokina et al., 2017). On the
other hand, given its potential to automate specific accounting and auditing processes,
blockchain is also feared as a threat to the status quo of the profession of accountants and
auditors, their practices and traditions (Tapscott and Tapscott, 2016; Casey and Vigna, 2018).
Thus, blockchain-based accounting could rule out conducting improper accountingmethods,
illicit structuring of transactions and financial database manipulations (Feng et al., 2011).
Another novel application of blockchain for accounting, including measurement
processing, auditing and communicating financial information about economic entities, is
ultimately based on ensuring truth, trust and transparency. The meaning and implication of
those concepts have been debated mainly in several domains of application of blockchain
technologies, mainly regarding cryptocurrency (Yen and Wang, 2019) and supply chain
management (Chang et al., 2019a, b). Despite scholars’ and researchers’ growing interest in
the accounting domain about the opportunities of blockchain adoption (Anderson, 2016;
Bons�on and Bedn�arov�a, 2019; Cai, 2021), the attention reserved for these critical factors is still
in an initial state and calls for further investigation and research. Specifically, it seems that
the current debate on the digitalisation in accounting, mainly regarding the adoption of
blockchain, has been more focused on the comprehension of their implications in terms of
technical issues and flows of data than in understanding the impact of these technologies on
the transparency, trust and trustworthiness of an accounting system. Lombardi et al. (2021)
and Secinaro et al. (2021) emphasise how the notions of truth, trust and transparency are
crucial factors affecting the success of this revolution in accounting and auditing. In this
direction, Cai (2021) and Chowdhury (2021) have recently argued that the shift from a double-
entry accounting system to a triple-entry one, caused by the adoption of blockchain
technology, can make the system more efficient by allowing companies to achieve trust and
transparency and causing a radical transformation in the accounting industry. When
properly implemented, triple-entry accounting with blockchain can fundamentally improve
AAAJ
35,7
1570
accounting-based mainly on a double-entry model (Cai, 2021). Thus far, few triple-entry
accounting blockchain products and services are fully living in the accounting area
(Chowdhury, 2021). Despite themassive potential of the triple-entry accounting framework in
accounting, the amount of academic research on this topic is limited, mainly regarding
antecedents and consequences of truth, trust and transparency.
Furthermore, auditors might use the blockchain comprehensive syntactic programming
to evaluate company information, confirming its truth directly. In this context, the blockchain
application establishes an automatic method for data transfer and, later, confirmation by all
users in the case of information revision. According to Tiberius and Hirth (2019) and Turker
and Bicer (2020), information immutability ensures thatmultiple stakeholders, such as banks,
courts, tax institutions, regulators, accountants and auditors, can verify the consistency of
records, thereby supporting corporate decision-making processes.
The trust that distinguishes the blockchain’s consensus mechanism allows the various
players in the network to exchange information in previously unthinkable ways, with a
positive effect on accounting and auditing theories and frameworks, such as support for the
International Financial Reporting Standards framework (Brown-Liburd et al., 2019; McCallig
et al., 2019). The trust obtained is consistent with the theoretical auditing component, which
calls for an audit committee to review corporate efficiency measures. However, these
theoretical concerns are not backed by strong data or empirical models (Lombardi et al., 2021;
Secinaro et al., 2021). Transparency, connected with decentralisation, allows all system
members to share and access data equitably and safely, obtaining history datasets, real-time
updates and final reports. These features are reminiscent of the three moments of the rational
administrator, which regards financial statements as representations of the decision-maker
choices. Besides, according to agency theory, improved transparency minimises information
asymmetry between parties and, as a result, canmitigate possible agency issues (Bons�on and
Bedn�arov�a, 2019). One of the pillars of this theory is the notion of information asymmetry
between agents. Nyumbayire (2017) asserts that blockchain enables the verification of
whether a specific agent has performed a specific action at a certain time. The blockchain’s
operations are traceable thanks to the usage of proofs of existence. With this technological
approach, the risk of an agent misbehaving can be lowered if not eliminated. Because the
blockchain permits quick verification of each computable transaction, it strengthens agent
responsibility and helps to reduce agency expenses. Indeed, it eliminates the legal system’s
requirement for most of the intermediaries to validate economic and financial transactions’
preconditions, execution and post conditions (Nyumbayire, 2017). Blockchain technology
enables users to execute and verify complicated contracts at a minimal cost as a result of
proofs of existence, smart contracts and autonomous agents. Control dimensions represent
another important factor. Control is further improved by the consensus required to add a
transaction to a block, and as a result, this consensus leads to increased data confidence since
transactions are validated by numerous nodes (Swan, 2015).
2.2 Blockchain in accounting: An ecosystem perspective
The impact of blockchain in accounting is disruptive (Smith and Castonguay, 2020), and it
represents a promising field for future research (Secinaro et al., 2021; Lombardi et al., 2021).
This is due to the actuality of the issue of digital transformation in accounting (Secinaro et al.,
2021) as in the rest of the society as well as on a dynamic profile of both accounting practice
and theory called to be always at the frontiers of the innovation for measuring and
communicating information about an entity’s performances to the stakeholders (Carnegie
et al., 2021).
Extant studies on the issues of blockchain in accounting allow depicting a complex
scenario where the technological features end up being mixed with technical and social
implications of accounting (Secinaro et al., 2021; Lombardi et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2019;
Blockchain
technology
design in
accounting
1571
Bons�on and Bedn�arov�a, 2019). A general consensus arises in the literature about the
opportunities offered by blockchain in accounting, although several dimensions of this digital
transformation process remain unexplored and need further clarification from a cross-
disciplinary perspective to include its societal implications (Secinaro et al., 2021). In this
direction, the recent research of Secinaro et al. (2021) allows identifying theoretical areas for
future exploration by integrating different disciplinary perspectives to provide a
comprehension of both the technological and social dimensions of blockchain adoption in
accounting.
All this finds confirmation in the recent study of Carnegie et al. (2021) about themeaning of
accounting today, where an interesting perspective arises about its meaning as an
increasingly relevant sociological practice due to its “pervasive, enabling and disabling social
phenomenon . . . progressively conceived as an instrument of power and control” (Carnegie
et al., 2021, p. 67). Consistent with the theory on the sociological perspective of accounting
including technological solutions, institutional and social issues (Covaleski and Dirsmith,
2012; Carnegie et al., 2021), the adoption of blockchain can be assumed as an enabling
platform for the creation of a community of stakeholders populating an accounting
ecosystem.
The issue of ecosystem arises as a promising perspective in the extant literature on
blockchain adoption in accounting (Cai, 2021; Bons�on and Bedn�arov�a, 2019). More
specifically, Dai and Vasarhekyi (2017) provide evidence on blockchain’s potential
contribution in enabling a real-time, verifiable and transparent accounting ecosystem.
Furthermore, Kwilinski (2019) highlights the contribution that blockchain can provide to
network accounting. As a distributed data system allows the instant information of all
participants, the presence of a single register of the transaction is assumable as a
decentralised structure for collective decision-making. According to Smith and Castonguay
(2020), the blockchain adoption for accounting calls for a more extensive and specialised
stakeholders’ community, including internal and external actors operating to assure the
updating of internal policies and procedures, and monitoring the regulation transactions.
With a specific focus on the initial coin offerings (ICOs), Feng et al. (2019) highlight the need to
assure the credibility of the information related to the transactions and evaluate buyers and
investors.
The network importance in the effective blockchain implementation for accounting is
highlighted in Kwilinski’s study (2019) in terms of collective approval by all the participants.
According to the author, some technical factors can impact this participatory process’s
effectiveness, such as the high speed of the service, interface with smart devices, optical data
recognition systems and user-friendly management of introductory documents
(Kwilinski, 2019).
The analysis of blockchain’s effects in accounting in terms of smart contracts,
cryptocurrency and ICOs provides several elements for our speculation from an ecosystem
perspective. Dai and Vasarhelyi (2017) demonstrated how blockchain in accounting suggests
the creation of an ecosystem of actors and the full integration of blockchain technology into a
real accounting ecosystem, which requires a consensus among regulators, auditors and other
parties. Nevertheless, Dai and Vasarhelyi (2017) introduce three different areas of challenges
(technological, organisational and environmental) that may hinder the adoption of this
technology in accounting and auditing. The technological context refers to the technical
complexity of blockchain platforms, which require financial and time resources. The
organisational context refers to managers’ willingness to accept this innovative approach.
The environmental context refers to regulators’ essential role in the adoption of blockchain
technology within the accounting ecosystem. Despite all the challenges highlighted by Dai
and Vasarhelyi (2017) that are relevant for the successful adoption of blockchain in
accounting, the ecosystem perspective resulting from this digitalisation process suggests the
AAAJ
35,7
1572
need of deepening a further challenge associated with the sociological dimension of the
ecosystem as well as the comprehension of the impact of truth, trust and transparency on
the flows and interactions among the nodes of the blockchain network.
From an ecosystem perspective, Cai (2021) highlights how the adoption of blockchain in
accounting suggests the opportunity to transition from a single entry to a triple entry
accounting system that more efficiently addresses fundamental trust and transparency
issues.
According to Schmitz and Leoni (2019), the perspective of the ecosystem resulting from
the adoption of blockchain in accounting suggests the need to invest in human capital to
create a new generation of accountants and auditors with competencies able to provide
solutions to changes of this radical innovation. The focus on the role of human capital in the
debate about the blockchain accounting ecosystem arises in the work of Schmitz and Leoni
(2019) as a critical factor impacting all four thematic areas identified in their literature
reviews, such as governance, transparency, trust, smart contracts and the new role of
accountants and auditors. Human capital is relevant for the implementation of new
mechanisms of governance, in assuring the level of transparency and trust request by
stakeholders’ collaboration (George and Patatoukas, 2020; Schmitz and Leoni, 2019) and
facilitating the technology implementation by demonstrating favourable behaviours in
adoption and use of technological solutions (Caldarelli et al., 2019).
In the same direction, the contribution of the blockchain to the creation of a performing
accounting ecosystem has been recently highlighted by G€okten and €Ozdo�gan (2020).
According to the authors, blockchain in accounting allows overcoming the presence of an
intermediary and regulatory platform for transactions related to the value exchange in terms
of stocks, derivatives and entities’ accounting operations. That is because, in coherence with
the principle of “internet of values,” blockchain works as a reliable infrastructure without any
regulators and intermediaries and enabling the collaboration between a broad and
differentiated stakeholders’ community (G€okten and €Ozdo�gan, 2020). The focus on the
stakeholders’ network resulting from a blockchain accounting ecosystem suggests the
opportunity to investigate the nature of the technology by distinguishing between public and
private blockchain. In a recent study on the revolutionary role of blockchain for accounting
and audit, George and Patatoukas (2020) provides an analysis of the benefits and limitations
of both the two typologies by highlighting in a context where it is necessary to protect and
limit the access to the data shared so that it could be useful to adopt a private blockchain.
That is more coherent with the accounting objectives. However, from this perspective, the
need for a more in-depth investigation arises regarding disclosure and reporting, where the
public nature could probably be more useful.
Overall, the application of blockchain technology in the accounting context could be
conducive to the industry, which is still mainly based on standardised technology, such as
computer-assisted audit techniques (Andersen, 2016). As the digitisation of accounting is still
in its infancy, the application of blockchain technologymay lead to the technological progress
needed. Specifically, previous literature has clearly shown that the ecosystem represents an
important and largely debated issue associatedwith the adoption of blockchain in accounting
(Bons�on and Bednarova, 2019; Dai and Vasarhekyi, 2017). However, its comprehension
remains normative, analysed mainly in theory, or limited to understanding the technical
implications of the blockchain in accounting practice, as in the recent study of Cai (2021) that
focuses on the shift from the double to the triple-entry accounting system. In the same
direction, Bons�on and Bedn�arov�a (2019) highlighted the need to investigate the effects of
blockchain adoption on the jobs of accountants and auditors and the stakeholders’ awareness
and acceptance. Their research focuses primarily on the technological perspectives of
revolution caused by the adoption of blockchain in an accounting ecosystem, suggesting the
need of further investigations on the sociological implications.

3. Theory and analytical framework for a blockchain-based accounting
ecosystem
According to the previous background, it is necessary to provide scenarios of
contextualisation to the transformation of accounting caused by the blockchain, deepening
the meaning of the ecosystem perspective and its sociological implications in terms of truth,
trust and transparency. Even though the previous literature on blockchain in accounting has
reserved great attention to each of these issues, the full comprehension of their impact on the
effectiveness of the network of actors populating the accounting ecosystem built on
blockchain is still fragmented and limited to a technological perspective. In the meantime, the
debate on the blockchain ecosystem from the managerial point of view has recently focused
on comprehension of the sociological implications of this phenomenon as well as on the
meaning of factors such as truth, trust and transparency into the process of interaction
between humans and machines (Schneider et al., 2020) or in the relationships between the
nodes of a digital supply chain (Batwa and Norrman, 2021). Despite the interest reserved for
these topics in the accounting field, exploring their meaning in the same perspective provides
areas for further investigation. This aspect represents the primary motivation for addressing
this study.
Moving from the above literature and research gap, we propose a customised adoption of a
blockchain technology system for accounting from an ecosystem perspective, as illustrated
by the architecture reported in Figure 1. The next points describe the different levels:
(1) At the ground level, the blockchain provides a technological infrastructure based on
the logic of the distributed database, in which the data is not stored on a centralised
server (client-server) but several interconnected peer-to-peer nodes. Each node keeps
a complete replica of all data stored. Before data are stored, they must be validated
through the network solving a non-trivial problem in a distributed network, known as
the Byzantine general problem. This problem is solved by the exertion of computer
power by which a particular target value must be found in accordance with the proof-
of-work (PoW) mechanism. After consensus, data are permanently stored in the
Figure 1.

blockchain. At this level, the blockchain customisation for an accounting domain is
represented by the definition of consensus rules.
(2) At the middle level, the blockchain provides the selection of different deployment
modes based on permission and data validation procedures for service-oriented
infrastructure, business process management and user interaction. As for
permissions, blockchain can be permissioned or permissionless (Swanson, 2015;
Peters and Panayi, 2016). Concerning data validation, it can be performed in a
centralised or decentralised mode. In the blockchain domain, the centralised mode is
represented by the fact that the validation is transmitted to a sample of changing
nodes, such as nodes delegated proof-of-work, responsible for the validation to
achieve low latency. Permission-less blockchains are typically characterised by
decentralised validation, whereas permissioned blockchains adopt centralised
validation (Swanson, 2015).
(3) At the top level, the blockchain provides system design decisions concerning business
and security application integration. Business applications include blocks for
accounting, financial management, asset trading, reporting, insurance and smart
contracts. Security applications comprise access control, audit, data security,
encryption, fraud detection and compliance management blocks. Nevertheless,
customisation may include other accounting blocks and system design decisions
related to different business sectors.
At the top level, it is possible to evaluate how changes in processes and behavioural dynamics
within the impacted ecosystem (Adner, 2016; Khurana and Dutta, 2021) are based on the
blockchain technology’s characteristics, namely trust, truth and transparency. Trust is one of
the primary characteristics of blockchain technology (Notheisen et al., 2017). Trust denotes an
exchange of actors’ expectations on which the other party can depend heavily, to behave as
expected and act reasonably (Nakamoto, 2008). Blockchain protocols’ main feature is
providing an immutable record of transactions by combining a distributed database with
transaction blocks linked chronologically and cryptographically via decentralised consensus
mechanisms (Nofer et al., 2017). This structure prevents the spread of incorrect or false
information and self-regulates behaviour without the need for central authorities (Douceur,
2002). If the participants in the private network are known, as is the case of an accounting
ecosystem, there is no threat of an attack, and thus the costs associated with security are
reduced. As a result, identity-based authentication (e.g. hash-based users) provides more
efficient alternatives that allow for varying levels of privacy (Meng et al., 2018; She
et al., 2019).
Truth represents the possibility to monitor the non-manipulation or tampering of
information and operations as well as the provision of information about them (Vladu et al.,
2017). In response to these issues, customers, banks and stakeholders require greater
traceability and knowledge about integrity of transactions, particularly about their financial
and social consequences (Awaysheh and Klassen, 2010). As a result, the real economic and
social challenge is to close the control gap in the accounting network, even if the transactions
are ethical, sanction-compliant or safe (Galvez et al., 2018). Defining the origin or the end of a
transaction and its integrity is frequently difficult due to networks’ complexity. Because of
this complexity, transactions must be tracked throughout their entire life cycle (Lu and Xu,
2017; Xu et al., 2019).
The degree to which information is easily accessible to both counterparties in exchange
and external observers is referred to as transparency (Bai and Sarkis, 2020). Given the
emerging secure environment associated with blockchain, transparency is thus a critical
parameter in evaluating the ecosystem’s performance. In this way, transparent and accurate

information can be managed for each phase, ensuring compliance and accuracy while also
focusing on social responsibility requirements (Kashmanian, 2017; Zhu et al., 2018). Current
markets necessitate the transparency of ecosystem information as well as environmental and
social sustainability of accounting network dynamics (Mann et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2018).
Greater transparency improves productivity, provides better customer service and reduces
internal and external auditing costs. As a result, transparency becomes a critical factor in
improving the entire ecosystem’s performance (Zelbst et al., 2019).
4. Methodology
This section explores how design science is used as a research technique to design, build and
evaluate a blockchain platform in the accounting domain. The section for the representation
of the design’s theoretical and functional effects also provides information on data collection
and processing.
This research follows the approach proposed by March and Smith (1995), intending to
create a more robust IT-solution artifact to better understand how blockchain can improve
organisational processes and capability (i.e. the ability to make strategic information faster,
safer, more traceable and transparent). March and Smith (1995) contended that design
research could yield four types of research outcomes (i.e. constructs, models, methods,
instantiations) and includes four main activities (i.e. build, evaluate, theorise, justify).
In our study, we design a framework as an artifact consisting primarily of a distributed
database, a selection of different deployment modes based on permission and data validation
procedures for service-oriented infrastructure, and a system design involving the integration
of business and security applications. Starting from the contribution of March and Smith
(1995), Hevner et al. (2004) provide seven practical guidelines for the building and application
of an artifact. In their recommended structure, Hevner et al. (2004) provide a description in
practical terms to explain the level of artifact abstraction and contribution to knowledge.
These guidelines on the development of the research design artifact results provide useful,
but not strictly prescriptive, criteria for defining the space for research design and specifying
a design-based solution artifact.
To achieve our design objectives, we divided the guidelines into three phases:
identification of the relevant problem and design artifact required (e.g. design as an
artifact, problem relevance); development and evaluation of the artifact (e.g. design
evaluation, research rigour, design as a search process) and dissemination and knowledge
creation of the research (e.g. research contributions; communication). Leveraging on the
above phases, Figure 2 represents a framework identifying how, through knowledge and
contextualisation of the problem, a blockchain-based platform can be created using a design–
science approach and how this, being constructed with rigour and relevance, can contribute
to development of the knowledge base and the environment.
The ecosystem describes the problem space in which the phenomena of interest exist. It
consists of blockchain actors, their current and expected technologies (Silver et al., 1995). It
contains the priorities, responsibilities, challenges and opportunities that identify business
needs, taking an accounting ecosystem perspective. The higher the ecosystem definition, the
higher will be the relevance of the artifact.
The knowledge base serves as the raw material for analysis, and it is composed of the
foundations and methodologies. Previous scientific studies include the foundational theories,
structures, tools, constructs, models, processes and instantiations used throughout the
research study. To achieve rigour, established foundations and methodologies are used. In
design science, computational and mathematical approaches are commonly used to
determine the quality and efficacy of artifacts; however, analytical techniques can also be
used. Contributions are evaluated as they are applied to a business requirement in a
AAAJ
35,7
1576
suitable setting and as they contribute to the knowledge base content for future study and
practice.
Design science approaches allow creating and evaluating an artifact, in this case a
blockchain-based accounting system infrastructure that is developed to fit the market’s
requirements. Design science research aims to create something useful in describing the
ecosystem processes and helping in process evaluations. Truth and utility are inseparably
linked. Design is influenced by reality, while theory is influenced by utility. In order to
produce the most efficient artefact that met the needs of the investigated situation, incoming
and outgoing interviews with various figures involved in the process (i.e. accounting
managers and employees) were conducted using the case study methodology approach
(Eisenhardt, 1989; Yin, 2018). The incoming interviews supported in developing a blockchain
system that responds profoundly to the system’s requirements.
Following the implementation of the blockchain platform, we conducted additional
interviews with accounting managers and employees to investigate the benefits of the
blockchain platform. Respondents, for example, were asked to assess how different the
process is after the blockchain introduction. The interviews were recorded, transcribed and
double-checked by the interviewees to avoid transcription errors or misunderstandings
during the interview in the material to be analysed later.
5. Results
The findings from the deployment of the blockchain platform will be presented in the
following sections, which will be separated into different phases: design and development,
testing and evaluation of a blockchain-based accounting system.
5.1 Design and development of a blockchain-based accounting system
This section aims to identify the technical and functional requirements that the technological
architecture of a blockchain should possess to facilitate the development and consolidation of
the relationships between the various actors operating in the accounting ecosystem,
considering the socio-economic and management processes.
Figure 3 reports the basic blockchain-based accounting system infrastructure. The
blockchain deploymentmodel is a private intra-corporate blockchain with a network of nodes

that validates transactions within the company. This network comprises companymanagers
operating in the accounting department and managers operating in associated control
entities. In line with several contributions that propose a blockchain technology for
accounting (Andersen, 2016; Bystr€om, 2016; Yermack, 2015), the consensus is defined
following the PoWmechanism. According to this mechanism, the consensus is established if
transactions are under the pre-specified rules. On the contrary, the node accounting network
rejects transactions that are not compliant. Valid transactions are subsequently stored and
transmitted to authorised employees within the company and to selected external actors (e.g.
external auditors).
Blockchainmakes it possible to innovate the currentmanagement of transactions through
a process that connects distributed, cryptographic primitives useful for guaranteeing the
security and traceability of information. Distributed systems’ main advantage in the
accounting domain is the presence of information on all the machines connected to
the network. This type of database is based on two fundamental processes, useful for
guaranteeing correct operations and limiting the loss of information:
(1) Database replication: There is software to identify any logical internal change to the
database; once the database has been identified, this software allows replicating the
change on all the machines connected to the accounting network.
(2) Duplication: This is a useful process to ensure that the same data is present on each
machine connected to the accounting network. This process allows identifying a
master database that will be duplicated on all the other network machines.
Blockchain functioning is based on the following components:
(1) Transaction: Logical processing unit which coincides with a sequence of elementary
operations that must be verified, approved and then archived;
(2) Node: Representation of a single blockchain actor and physically constituted by a
server;
(3) Block: Logical unit represented by the union of a set of transactions grouped to be
verified, approved and archived;
(4) Ledger: Master book in which all transactions are recorded immutably, in order and
sequentially;
(5) Hash: Non-invertible algorithmic function allows representing a text and/or numeric
string of a variable length in a unique string of predefined length.
The blockchain is a chain of blocks, where the set of transactions represents the block.
Therefore, the block can be considered a container of transactions; inside it is useful
information to temporally and spatially reconstruct the chain of blocks that are created. Each
block contains within it a pointer called a hash, located in the header, which records the
information relating to the block in position n and the information relating to the block placed
in position n � 1; based on this principle, the entire chain of blocks can be built. From the
technological perspective, the hash is the result of an algorithm called hash function. Hash
functions have two main features: they are characterised by a string of arbitrary length
(input) and a string of defined length (output) and (2) they are irreversible functions, that is,
from the knowledge of the generated string (output) it is not possible in any way to trace or
generate the starting string.
An example is the SHA-256, which is one of the best-known hash functions used to obtain
an alphanumeric string that is always 64 characters long, regardless of the (arbitrary) length
of the starting string. This function is called SHA-256 because it identifies a binary number of
Blockchain
technology
design in
accounting
1579
256 digits/bit (or a succession of 256 zeros and ones), transformed into hexadecimal, results in
a string of 64 characters. Each block contains a hash, and this allows a unique and secure
identification. Moreover, the hash allows the construction of the entire blockchain’s spatial
mapping, which is continuously updated as new blocks are added. In addition to the hash,
there is also a timestamp in the block through the practice of timestamping. This practice
consists of a specific sequence that allows unambiguous block identification and, therefore,
the transactions. This timestamp allows development of a timeline map useful for
understanding the order in which the transactions take place.
To sum up, in a distributed system applied to the blockchain, it is necessary to know both
the hash and the temporal brand to be able to recreate both the chain of blocks spatially and
temporally. Instead, the transaction contains the following information: (1) IP address of the
sender and recipient, the cryptographic signature necessary to guarantee the security of the
transaction and information regarding the transaction content and characteristics. Since
the number of transactions varies continuously over time, the blockchain can be continuously
updated on all network nodes. That is possible thanks to the use of cryptographic primitives
that guarantee the correct functioning of the system. Furthermore, the transactions are
unchangeable; any change requires the consent of all the nodes present in the accounting
network. All transactions are noted with maximum transparency and in an unchangeable
manner in the ledger. The ledger can be considered as the aggregation of several blocks
interconnected using cryptographic primitives and hash.
The blockchain is the realisation of the distributed ledger, which is the evolution of
centralised and decentralised logic. In the centralised logic (centralised ledger), each
transaction is managed by a central node, which has a centralised authority, acts as an
intermediary and verifies information correctness and security. There is no single centralised
authority to refer to in the case of decentralised logic (decentralised ledger), but more central
subjects are set up in a local centralisation logic. The blockchain is based on distributed logic
(distributed ledger); i.e. there is no longer any centralised authority but parity between the
accounting network actors. Consensus between peer-to-peer nodes, an essential requirement
in the centralised system, is replaced by cryptographic primitives and protocols, and the
figure of the intermediation nodes is definitively eliminated. There is no central point of
vulnerability in blockchain platforms allowing attempts to tamper with the system. These
characteristics substantially distinguish the blockchain from centralised databases. These
factors guarantee the security of the information shared in the network.
As for the mechanism that leads to the creation of blocks starting from transactions, the
following procedure is followed to interact with the system: (1) creation of the transaction and
public cryptographic key; (2) creation of the block containing the transaction mentioned above;
(3) verification and approval of the block by the accounting network actors; (4) verification of
the truthfulness of the information by the actors of the accounting network; (5) evaluation of
previous checks and adding blocks to the accounting network; (6) authorisation and validation
of the transaction; and (7) publication of the transaction in the ledger.
The blockchain-based accounting system design was associated with research conducted
in the accounting department of an innovative company located in the South of Italy. It
provides industrial waste disposal services for multinational companies operating in the
automotive and railway manufacturing business. It is currently based in a relevant district
for mechanical and railway engineering and production at the national and international
level. This investigation context seems to be a suitable choice because management
accounting is a critical process in this industry. Rethinking business operations can help
managers identify, measure, analyse, interpret and communicate information to support
short- and long-term decisions.
A primary research activity was based on interviews, mapping the accounting processes
and validation workshops. A secondary research activity was based on analysis of
AAAJ
35,7
1580
accounting reports and databases from the past 12 months, accounting process descriptions
and monthly/quarterly reports. This second activity was used to include and triangulate
sources with primary data. Triangulation activity was necessary to strengthen this
research’s validity and reliability. The first data collection consisted of over 80 h of direct
contact:
(1) Face-to-face interviews with company managers and employees for the accounting
departments;
(2) Shadowing accounting processes by direct observation. The researchers followed a
sample of processes, mapping their activities and timing them.
The other data collection method used over 12 months of the study included:
(1) Active remote interactions: For example, multiple questions and clarifications over
the phone, e-mail and Skype;
(2) A validation workshop with accounting managers;
The next subsections present the development and application of a blockchain-based
accounting system. The three main steps conducted for the blockchain architecture design
process are (1) blockchain-based accounting system analysis, (2) PoC framework design and
deployment and (3) network modelling.
A detailed description of each phase is provided in the paragraphs that follow.
5.2 Test
5.2.1 Phase 1: Blockchain-based accounting system analysis. A blockchain-based accounting
system is particularly significant for companies, banks and public administrations operating
as accounting providers for private/public clients or companies. In such a complex system,
the possibility to have information always available, with no intermediaries and already
verified, represents an increasingly critical success factor in the new accounting business
model (Dal Mas et al., 2020). This critical success factor could be supported by the rapid
technological changes taking place in the contemporary scenario. Organisations typically do
not have dedicated resources to monitor, follow and respond to the dynamic technological
evolutions, which means they soon find themselves out of touch, a situation that highlights
the importance of having a blockchain able to support decision-making and operational
strategies of individual actors and networks. Many accountancy organisations have
expressed their interest in blockchain technology, and several projects have been started.
Many financial and professional institutions have conducted various initiatives that aim to
explore this technology’s potential for accounting and auditing.
The company accounting cycle is structured in eight steps. The first step consists of
identification of transactions. The company has many transactions simultaneously in the
cycle, and great attention is needed to record them on its books correctly. Sales technology
points are linked with their books to record sales transactions; other times, there are
intermediaries to add other costs to the transactions.Afterward, as the second step, there is the
creation of entries for each transaction. The several sale technology points can help combine
the first two steps, but the company must also monitor costs. The choice between accrual and
cash accounting can dictate when transactions are officially recorded. Cash accounting
requires transactions to be recorded when cash is either received or paid. Double-entry
bookkeeping calls for recording two journal entries with each transaction to manage a
thoroughly developed balance sheet alongwith an income statement and cash flow statement.
With double-entry accounting, each transaction has a debit and a credit equal to each
other. In the third step, once a transaction has been posted as a journal entry, it should be
Blockchain
technology
design in
accounting
1581
published to an account in the general ledger. General ledger provides all accounting
activities breakdown by account. That allows dedicated employees to monitor positions and
financial status. One of the most commonly referenced accounts is the cash account, which
details the available amount of money.
At the end of the accounting period, a trial balance is calculated as the fourth step to find
unadjusted balances in each account. The unadjusted trial balance is then carried over to the
fifth stage for testing and analysis. A worksheet is created and used to ensure that debits and
credits are equal. If there are any discrepancies for matching income and expenses, changes
must be made to adjust line items. In the sixth step, a bookkeeper makes adjustments.
Adjustments are recorded as journal entries where necessary. Downstream of all
adjustments, the system generates its balance sheet in the seventh step. For most
businesses, these statements include an income statement, balance sheet and cash flow
statement. Finally, the company ends the accounting cycle in the eighth stage by closing its
books on the specified closing date. The closing statements provide a report for analysing
performance over the period. After closing, the accounting cycle starts over again from the
beginning with a new reporting period. Accounting managers can analyse data and try to
summarise any performance indicators.
With a blockchain-based approach, a transaction can be directly recorded and verified
between debtors and creditors. A smart contract is subscribed with all the transaction
information and the asset flow. Information and asset tracking are necessary only for a new
entry in the blockchain platform; all the others can be easily verified through the related
smart contract hash. A balance sheet can be created automatically at the end of the
accounting period or in middle time steps, focusing on each transaction classification.
Recorded transactions will include monetary exchanges between two parties and the
accounting data flow within a company. In this way, it will be possible to get indicators close
to real-time reporting by instantly broadcasting accounting information to interested parties,
such as managers, auditors, creditors and stakeholders.
5.2.2 Phase 2: PoC framework design and deployment. In computer science, a PoC is
defined as a practical demonstration of a software application’s basic operations or an entire
system, integrating it into an already existing environment. The PoC development is used to
demonstrate the existence of a vulnerability in a software or in a computer system, the
exploitation of which may allow unauthorised access to the data contained in the system or
compromise its functionality.
For the realisation of this structure for the company, the research team involved in this
project decided to use Hyperledger Fabric, an open-source project founded by Linux
Foundation in 2015, created to enable the construction of permissioned blockchains. The
feature that distinguishes Hyperledger Fabric is represented by modularity that allows
defining consensus mechanisms and membership management. It also offers the possibility of
creating private channels (e.g. financial team, accounting process team, auditing process team),
allowing a group of company participants to create a ledger where transactions are recorded in
a completely confidentialmanner, which can only be viewed by the nodes that participated in it.
Currently, the blockchain platform has been configured on-premises. Installing an
on-premises program means installing it on a local device – i.e. a machine that
physically resides within the company that uses it or still owns it (namely a company
server).
5.2.3 Phase 3: Network modelling. The network modelled in Figure 4 was used to identify
the main ecosystem actors involved as nodes of the blockchain platform to be developed.
The specific testing network included:
(1) Stakeholders (S): This node represents the private clients or company stakeholder
level aiming to buy titles, stocks, tokens or other types of assets.
AAAJ

(2) Company (C): This node represents the enterprise-level aiming to invest in accounting
operations.
(3) Bank (B): This node represents the bank level where accounting operations happens
financially.
(4) Public Administration (PA): This node represents the public owner of accounting
assets and the leading accounting regulator.
(5) Auditor (A): This node represents a third-party service provider with the role to
investigate the quality and security of accounting operations.
Each node has a single well-known identity. The node identity is used to represent the node in
transactions. These identities are distinct from the remote procedure call user accesses to
connect to the node remotely on a computer other than the one on which the program is run.
Each network has a networkmapping service that maps each well-known node identity to an
IP address. These IP addresses are used for messaging between nodes. Nodes can also
generate confidential identities for individual transactions. The certificate chain linking a
confidential identity to a well-known node or a real-world legal identity is distributed only as
needed. This aspect ensures that even if an attacker gains access to an unencrypted
transaction, it is impossible to identify the transaction participants without further
information if confidential identities are used.
A fundamental aspect of the accounting blockchain platform design is creating private
channels to perform operations with each of the actors participating in the network, shielding
their privacy, further strengthening their position in the network. However, the accounting
blockchain platform allows transparency in displaying any asset transaction that occurs
among the various nodes in the network, although it does not participate directly in
operations. Furthermore, this technology guarantees greater transparency in the origin and
reliability of the accounting services provided and simplifies the auditors’ control. An asset is
identified as any property owned by a company that can be monetised. Tracking company
assets is a fundamental process and an investment for a company that wants to save money
and time. Developing and implementing asset traceability reduces administration costs and
streamlines the business, improving the quality of service and pushing the scalability of its
business. All these processes favour organisational efficiency, reducing management costs
and anticipating needs by administering company assets.
5.3 Evaluation
This section analyses the characteristics of blockchain technology pre- and post-
implementation, and the related improvement carried by the blockchain adoption into the
accounting ecosystem. We provide some excerpts from interviews conducted following the
implementation of the blockchain platform to highlight key aspects.
The accounting manager reports: “During the implementation period of the blockchain
platform, I discovered that employees were more efficient in the exploitation of economic and
financial databases becausemore data become available and a series of information related to
their control was already present, eliminating the need for an analysis to validate their origin
or correctness.”
Adopting blockchain technology increases efficiency and saves time and money in
operations like access control, data and identity validation and compliance verifications.
Generally, during the transaction moderation, intermediation of other nodes was necessary
(i.e. for identity validation, data integrity) and human errors could occur (R€uckesh€auser, 2013;
Cai and Zhu, 2016).
An accounting employee reports: “Using distributed accounting registers, compilation is
much easier because, even if a compilation error occurs, the system indicates that the data has
AAAJ
35,7
1584
not been verified; all cost items are coded in digital format, making it easy to find the
information required to justify them. Recursive or interconnected cost items can be analysed
together, saving time and increasing confidence in the result that is carried forward in the
accounting registers.” With the support of the blockchain, all these operations are solved
rapidly through the hash-integrity validation of the smart contracts linked with the block to
be verified, significantly reducing human errors. These results can improve both company
efficiency and effectiveness and stakeholders’ satisfaction (Palfreyman, 2015; Tapscott and
Tapscott, 2016a, b; Cai and Zhu, 2016; Laguir et al., 2019; Span�o et al., 2019).
An employee states: “When a contract is stipulated or an economic transaction is carried
out, all information related to these processes, such as the identifiers of the actors involved
and the relative authorizations, is recorded in the block. As a result, it is no longer necessary
to contact the bank to find out if a transaction has been authorised. This data is already
present in the block. Even in the case of tenders, specific blocks that certain people can only
consult after a certain time can be created. The tender is thus safer and more equitable, as
there is no possibility of changing offers after they have been made.”
Blockchain technology use reduces the number of intermediary nodes necessary in the
accounting process and as consequence the necessary actorsworking in the ecosystems. Since
the blockchain technology transaction mechanisms are trusted and transparent, and the
information is available in real-time, the accounting blockchain-based process does not require
amiddle-node. Data registered in the blockchain are immutable. This allows reaching a system
where the company can negotiate directly with stakeholders, banks and public administration
(Andreassen et al., 2018). The direct negotiation has additional benefits on efficiency, service
cost reduction, and fraud detection (Palfreyman, 2015; Atzori, 2015; Tapscott and Tapscott,
2016a, b; R€uckesh€auser, 2017). This is a key characteristic since it allows automatic
contract execution and payment, bypassing intermediaries, most notably lawyers (in the
case of smart contracts), banks (in the case of cryptocurrencies) and governments, which
may find themselves out of business because of the strong privacy possible for both contract
terms and payments (Bedn�arov�a and Bons€on, 2019; Marrone and Hazelton, 2019).
An internal auditor reports: “Previously, controlling and validating balance sheets was a
very time-consuming process for checking the information reported and locating what
appeared to be missing. In some cases, this search for information or documents was
impossible because archives do not allow for the storage of a large amount of material for an
extended period of time. Despite the fact that many documents have gone digital, retrieving
them is still difficult in most cases because they are scattered across multiple archives. The
use of a technology that stores the codes of previous blocks in digital blocks so that they can
be recalled proving the veracity of the information reported is not only more practical and
safer, but also much more efficient.” The audit process becomes faster and more accurate.
Before introducing blockchain technology, the audit process had to verify all the information
related to the accounting process and verify each actors’ profile in the network. Additionally,
the audit process could not use all historical data before blockchain implementation because
they were deleted periodically due to storage issues. As explained before, all the transactions
are tracked and verified directly by the technology when a new block is added, and no
information is deleted; blocks are immutable. Many audit checks and security operations are
unnecessary, so the process is smarter and faster (Ming and Rui, 2017; Anwar et al., 2019).
Data is chronologically stored so that it can also be tracked continuously and in a timely
manner, and the efficiency of financial audit work can be improved. The ledger
decentralisation and distribution allow achieving a reduction of the storage cost of
financial audit data (Ming and Rui, 2017; Anwar et al., 2019).
The accounting manager states: “When a user authorises his credentials to the platform,
he receives his own identifier, which allows whoever creates a block to be identified in a
unique and secure manner. Each action always reports the signature of the person who
Blockchain
technology
design in
accounting
1585
performed it, and this allows us to not only attribute the work to the person who perform it,
but also to understand if there have been errors or, worse, attempts to falsify transactions or
documents.”
By analysing blockchain architecture, private blockchain architecture seems to be the
better choice for accounting solutions. It would help avoid manipulations and fraud, enable
the instant sharing of information and enhance information integrity with the right process
scalability. A public blockchain allows every node in the network to view confidential
information. On the contrary, this does not happenwith a private blockchain (Andersen, 2016;
Bons�on and Bedn�arov�a, 2019). Private blockchains’ use allows companies to achieve secure
and encrypted transactions, avoiding the possibilities of malicious actions or behaviours.
Transactions are stored in distributed ledgers, and every actor gets a ledger copy. To modify
the information fraudulently in one block, it would be necessary to modify the same block in
each of the different ledgers of all the network nodes (R€uckesh€auser, 2017; Bons�on and
Bedn�arov�a, 2019).
Furthermore, the use of cryptocurrencies or other tokenised assets into a blockchain
platform is preferred for two reasons. The first reason is linked directly with the ICO. The use
of tokens to participate in crowdfunding allows the system to keep track of the different
tokens used for the ICO, since they can easily flow on the network and register smart
contracts (Dai and Vasarhelyi, 2017; Del Mas, 2020). As a result, the system has better
financial traceability, decreases the number of fraud incidents and gives the possibility to
achieve truthful information. The second reason is that token use can increase the
stakeholders’ satisfaction. If the company creates its token to sell to stakeholders, they will
obtain specific rights to participate in the company’s decisions through an ICO, with the
maximum transparency granted by blockchain platforms (Del Mas et al., 2020).
Some issues arise during blockchain implementation. It became evident that if several
networks use different blockchain platforms in the same company, they cannot communicate
directly among them because information needs to be decrypted and re-encrypted. Users
authorised on different chains can check their information, but no merging action has been
possible between blocks of different chains. Ledger duplication also generates losses in
terms of efficiency and storage capacity (O’Leary et al., 2017; Dib, 2018). It would thus be
convenient in future research to disseminate the benefits of using the same blockchain
platform for different networks to create a blockchain consortium where information can
flow quickly and with transparency, but with the highest privacy for the various actors
(O’Leary et al., 2017).
The creation of this blockchain consortium could also be extended to the entire accounting
supply chain. In this way, with the creation of a single cloud database, several private
blockchains can branch with high positive effects (i.e. processing capacity, efficiency, cost
reduction). With a high number of ledgers, the blockchain platform obtains a high-security
rate, and fraud actions become very difficult. Decision-making and forecasts can be
performed more easily considering real-time and transparent information (BitFury, 2016;
Mearian, 2017; O’Leary et al., 2017).
The identity validation process could be improved by using the national digital identity
system (Benedict et al., 2021). The validation of several identities simplifies the actors’
verifiability in entry and improves communication with banks and government authorities.
An internal auditor states: “Trust in the quality of the final product, in our case financial
statements, is now placed in technology rather than people. If it was previously necessary to
check each operation step by step by conducting cross-checks with third parties to avoid
human tampering in information, potentially duplicating the work done in the reporting
phase, this is no longer necessary. Once the accountant has verified an expense, all we have to
do is check if the block relating to this operation is not corrupt, and obviously that gives us the
opportunity to performmore in-depth analyses and assessments with greater security; all the
AAAJ
35,7
1586
operations done previously are monitored and controllable by all those who have access to
that type of information.”
More in detail, the adoption of blockchain technology alters the concept of trust among
accounting ecosystem participants. Storing and maintaining data, information and
transaction records in a decentralised and distributed ledger increases trustworthiness
among actors who do not have a centralised authority (Notheisen et al., 2017). Trust in
ecosystem actors or in the accounting system was replaced by trust in the technology (Nofer
et al., 2017). As a result, it is no longer dependent on trusted partners or intermediaries to
manage data, information, contracts and transactions.
To summarise, the blockchain implementation provides a trust mechanism for the various
actors in the accounting ecosystem (Farooque et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019).
Before implementing blockchain technology, monitoring processes’ integrity relied on
labour resources to acquire, store and distribute up-to-date and confirmed data from different
transactions. Individual actors used various traditional methods to manage the technical
details of truth, such as e-mail, correspondence, phone calls, electronic data interchange (EDI),
value-added network or ERP systems. Individual actors, however, did not adopt a
coordinated monitoring system, which reduces large data volumes among multiple partners;
the monitoring of decision-making processes has always represented a costly and time-
consuming activity resulting in potential profits and efficiency loss.
Following implementation, blockchain technology enables a near-real-time anti-
tampering monitoring system that allows for timely and automatic updates of data status
to make efficient and effective business decisions and auditing actions.
From a theoretical point of view, the contribution of this research is represented by both
the proposed design science model and the formal PoC. This contribution allows better
understanding how tomanage accountability operations in a digital environment. According
to March and Smith (1995), empirical papers conducted in collaboration with organisations
blur the lines between academic research and industrial adoption of technological solutions.
Publication of these findings will support the development of domain-independent and
scalable solutions to large-scale information system problems within organisations.
6. Discussion, conclusion and implications
In the accounting digitalisation process, blockchain represents the most promising and
powerful technologies. Despite the great interest in the literature, full comprehension of the
scenarios for adopting blockchain technology in accounting is still fragmented and limited to
the associated technical issues. Digital transition seems to be advancing rapidly, and new
consortiums have emerged to accelerate the definition of industrial standards and to foster
collaboration (Kokina et al., 2017). New approaches to security and privacy controls are also
emerging. Blockchain’s transformative potential in accounting and auditing can be
acknowledged despite the pending challenges, particularly concerning continuous
accounting, auditing and reporting. The motivation to design and implement a blockchain
platform was influenced by the demand for transparency across accounting processes.
Eliminating centralised authorities improves transparency, which influences how ecosystem
partners collaborate. Higher transparency is also achieved thanks to the inherent tamper-
proof mechanism that distinguishes blockchain technology.
Storing distributed records on a blockchain platform improve transparency in the flow of
process status information, which improves individual actors’ and the ecosystem’s
operational efficiency in terms of time efficiency and system automation (Fahimnia et al.,
2015; Selmi et al., 2018).
Furthermore, recording data on the blockchain platform eliminates the need for a
combination of on-chain and off-chain systems. A private and permissioned blockchain

improves transparency by requiring access control to authorised data, making information
access more effective and secure. Finally, the immutability of the distributed ledger ensures
transparency over time through inviolable and node-verified mechanisms, disintermediation
and automatic processes, convenience and streamlining in terms of data extraction and
comprehension (Swan, 2015; Zhu et al., 2018; Leng et al., 2019).
Through the blockchain-enabled concepts of distributed consensual accounting records,
smart audit procedures and blockchain-based triple-entry bookkeeping, continuous
accounting and auditing have gained new dimensions and appear to be moving
increasingly towards being realised (Cai, 2021; Inghirami, 2020; Rozario and Vasarhelyi,
2018). In comparison to other alternatives such as ERP or distributed databases, the added
value of blockchain stems from the combination of all its elements, including immutability,
consensus, decentralisation and encryption.
With the aim of contributing to the advancement of knowledge in this domain by
demonstrating the implications of blockchain in the creation of an accounting ecosystem, this
paper has presented a conceptual framework supporting the creation of a technology-based
accounting environment. Organised around three scalable levels, the framework presents at
the first level a technological infrastructure founded on a distributed database, with peer-to-
peer storage based on interconnection and after consensus in the system. At the intermediate
level, increasing control levels are assured through permissions and validation. At the higher
level, the system provides integration of business and security applications. The deployment
of a structured blockchain-based accounting ecosystem relies on a private network of nodes
that validates transactions. However, blockchain is disruptive in terms of how processes can
be carried out and how the ecosystem works. Individual actors no longer need to control data
or monitor what the remaining actors are doing. They can simply trust technology, as
blockchain contributes to the creation of an accounting transaction system that is verifiable
and transparent in real time (Dai and Vasarhekyi, 2017). Furthermore, the presence of a
distributed transaction ledger is assumed to be a decentralised decision-making structure,
reducing information asymmetry and the possibility of tampering (Kwilinski, 2019).
Blockchain adoption for accounting requires amore comprehensive and specialised culture of
stakeholders, including internal and external actors, to ensure proper rule and procedure
updating and monitoring (Smith and Castonguay, 2020). Blockchain can also support
developing a performing accounting ecosystem (G€okten and €Ozdo�gan, 2020), eliminating the
need for intermediaries and regulatory platforms for value exchange transactions, reducing
manual registration and verification and enabling the automation of many processes and
activities with consequent improvement in terms of efficiency (Chang et al., 2019a, b; Pereira
et al., 2019; G€okten and €Ozdo�gan, 2020).
The analysis of dynamics characterising the ecosystem as well as the comprehension of
the meaning of issues such as truth, trust and transparency in social interactions undertaken
within the community of actors populating the system allows contributing to the debate on
blockchain’s transformation of accounting by overcoming the limitations highlighted in the
literature.
Furthermore, this paper provides evidence for developing a blockchain architecture
design based on three phases related to platform analysis, PoC framework design and
deployment and accounting blockchain-based modelling. The implementation of this
blockchain platform is associated in this paper with the analysis of antecedents and
consequences. By allowing increased efficiency, time andmoney saving in operations, access
control, data and identity validation, the adoption of blockchain in accounting is associated
with a reduction of human errors (Cai, 2021; Cai and Zhu, 2016) as well as meaningful
improvement of efficiency and effectiveness (Laguir et al., 2019). From the ecosystem
perspective, the adoption of a blockchain accounting system is expected to optimise the
management of the complexity of the network of actors by enhancing trust, transparency and
AAAJ
35,7
1588
real-time availability for the whole stakeholders’ community (Andreassen et al., 2018) as well
as disclosing new scenarios of digital accounting transformation by enriching themeaning of
the shift from the double to the triple-entry system (Cai, 2021; Chowdhury, 2021) with
intangible issues.
The proposed value-added tracking process will allow ecosystem participants to share a
ledger and use smart contracts to monitor changes in transaction state. Individual actors can
monitor a status change triggered by an automated event mechanism through the use of
smart contracts (Swan, 2015; Zhu et al., 2018). Because smart contracts can automatically
activate information push mechanisms, the updated process status can be monitored in real
time by partners who are registered on specific contracts.
The proposed blockchain platform ensures greater operational efficiency through real-
time notification of information changes based on push mechanisms. As a result, ecosystem
partners can reduce the costs associated with traditional monitoring methods to achieve
information synchronisation among themselves (Xu et al., 2019). In summary, the
implementation of a blockchain platform allows for synchronisation of monitoring
information and the reduction of resources required to confirm process status. This in turn
accelerates process automation and disintermediation through the use of smart contracts
(Chang et al., 2019a, b; Pereira et al., 2019).
6.1 Implications for practices
As a conceptual paper based on the investigation of the existing literature, this research sheds
new light on blockchain’s meaning and implication for accounting. In this perspective, the
conceptualisation of the three-level framework for a blockchain accounting environment is
primary, and the details of its technological requirements are the study’s main practical
contribution. Nevertheless, the technology is still at an early stage. Developers and designers
must facemany challenges to lead it to itsmaturity. Issues such as suitable architecture designs,
flexibility and cybersecuritymust be addressed (CoyneandMcMickle, 2017; Dai andVasarhelyi,
2017). More pilot programs and research are therefore needed to tackle technological issues and
shed more light on the potential of this technology and its use in accounting. Finally, to include
blockchain technology fully into a real ecosystem, non-technical issues would inevitably arise,
such as reaching a consensus among regulators, auditors and public administrators. Due to its
cross-disciplinary nature resulting from the combination of the issues of digital technologies,
stakeholders’ perspective and ecosystems, the proposed framework represents an original and
novel contribution to the current debate on blockchain and accounting.
6.2 Implications for theory
Several implications can be identified also in this research. First, it addresses overcoming gaps
emerging in the literature about the adoption of blockchain in accounting, by confirming the
importance of embracing a cross-disciplinary perspective for the full understanding of the
several benefits resulting from the adoption of blockchain in accounting (Secinaro et al., 2021;
Lombardi et al., 2021). This contribution provides evidence for a greater comprehension of the
phenomenon and the meaning of disruptive innovation and digital transformation caused by
blockchain in accounting theory andpractices (George and Patatoukas, 2020; Sinha, 2020; Smith
and Castonguay, 2020). Second, adoption of a sociological perspective in the proposal of the
conceptual framework for the creation of a digital accounting ecosystem has highlighted the
multidimensional nature of blockchain-based accounting by demonstrating the scalability of
the technological model associated with increasing levels of trust, transparency and truth
(Andreassen et al., 2018; Dai and Vasarhelyi, 2017; Schmitz and Leoni, 2019) as well as by
offering a good test for experimentingwith the opportunity of investigative work in accounting
nurtured by different disciplinary approaches (Secinaro et al., 2021).

In contributing to the debate on the ecosystem perspective resulting from the blockchain’s
adoption in accounting as a still under-researched perspective (G€okten and €Ozdo�gan, 2020;
Stafford and Treiblmaier, 2020), this study has allowed identifying some strategic features as
the basis for the successful adoption of blockchain in accounting, such as human capital
competencies, new governance mechanisms and the use of smart contracts (Lombardi et al.,
2021; Carnegie et al., 2021; George andPatatoukas, 2020; Schmitz andLeoni, 2019).This is a third
important implication for the future advancement of the research agenda in a cross-disciplinary
perspective. Fourth, the relevance and rigour of our study is assured by the use of the design–
science approach that guided us in the construction of the blockchain platform. Furthermore, the
theoretical perspective in using the design science approach for an IT artifact is compelling,
given that the proposed blockchain platform explains accounting ecosystem behaviours, has a
clear perceived usefulness and impacts both single actors and ecosystem organisations (Hevner
et al., 2004). In confirming the multifaceted nature of the digital transformation process, this
perspective suggests the better understanding of the role of blockchain in the dynamics of
collaboration among the different categories of stakeholders as well as exploring its implication
in creation of an accounting ecosystem (Bons�on and Bedn�arov�a, 2019; Dai and Vasarhekyi,
2017). In the meantime, by contributing to a major comprehension of the principle of “internet of
values” (G€okten and €Ozdo�gan, 2020), it has allowed identifying a contribution in terms of new
bases in research about the disclosure of intangible value (Dumay and Cai, 2014; Massaro and
Dumay, 2017; Yu et al., 2018; Dumay and Guthrie, 2019; Yen and Wang, 2019).
6.3 Limitations and future research
The study limitations refer to the need for empirical evidence and scenarios of
contextualisation focused on the adoption of blockchain platforms in the accounting
ecosystem. To test the proper rigour of schema proposed, the application of the framework in
real settings of accounting discloses bases for future investigations. Research methods can be
extended to include experiments, surveys, interviews and case studies. Additionally, to
provide more significant foundational support, the conceptual and theoretical bases must be
further examined in a sample composed of a larger number of empirical contexts. Given the
complex nature of blockchain,more cross-disciplinary studies utilising technology, economics
and psychology are also required in future research. It could be useful to compare different
industrial contexts to derive common and specific patterns and deepen the implications of the
blockchain in accounting from the ecosystem and sociological perspectives.
