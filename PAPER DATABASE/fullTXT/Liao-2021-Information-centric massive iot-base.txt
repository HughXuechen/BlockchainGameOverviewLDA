Abstract—The development of massive IoT has not only
brought about a wealth of hardware resources but also brought
about the problems of difficult data management, resource run-
ning and low efficiency. The emergence of sixth-generation (6G)
network will not only provide faster data rates, more device
connections but also bring ubiquitous virtual reality/augmented
reality (VR/AR) services. In the 6G era, large-scale IoT devices
will generate VR/AR service and resource requirements, and the
network will also face unprecedented pressure to respond to the
ubiquitous VR/AR requirements. To address the above issues,
this article proposes the information-centric massive Internet
of Things (IC-mIoT) suitable for 6G large-scale VR/AR con-
tent distribution to improve the efficiency of IC-mIoT and fully
guarantee the Quality of Service (QoS) of users. First, this arti-
cle introduces the blockchain for IC-mIoT nodes and proposes
a new consensus mechanism Proof-of-Cache-Offloading (PoCO).
Second, an architecture using blockchain-enabled IC-mIoT for
VR/AR is proposed in this article. The massive IoT resources
are fully integrated and scheduled to support large-scale VR/AR
applications and IC-mIoT. Third, a Stackelberg game model
and a cache index selection and calculation algorithm are for-
mulated for blockchain-enabled cache offloading. The analysis
and performance simulation results indicate the superiority and
effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

I. INTRODUCTION
THE SIXTH generation (6G) mobile network is expected
to cast high-speed and high-efficiency transmission
standards to adapt to the further development of new
applications [1]. Virtual reality/augmented reality (AR/VR)
is considered as one of the most important high-throughput
application-level requirements of 6G. Once AR/VR can be
used more simply, conveniently and without location restric-
tions, it will promote the rapid development of AR/VR

services and applications, and then stimulate the rapid
development and maturity of AR/VR devices themselves. In
the 6G era, the interaction form of media will develop into
high-fidelity AR/VR interaction, and even ubiquitous VR/AR-
based holographic information interaction. The ubiquitous
AR/VR will become an inevitable application supported by
6G, and will be deeply integrated with massive IoT [2]. The
required data rate will far exceed other applications we cur-
rently know, which puts greater pressure on the network to
potential risks. For the ubiquitous VR/AR requirements in
6G scenarios, it is very important to provide VR/AR with
the required resources (e.g., computing power, storage space,
graphics processing capabilities, communication resources)
through massive IoT devices to achieve the enhancement of
VR/AR capabilities feasible [3].
With the widespread adoption of massive IoT, the number of
connected devices is growing at an exponential rate, which is
contributing to ever increasing, massive data volumes [4]–[7].
The development of massive IoT has brought about an abun-
dance of potential resources but also caused problems, such as
difficult data management, resource congestion, and low system
efficiency. Recent studies pointed out that IoT scales better than
the traditional host-centric IP model in an information-centric
network (ICN) architecture [8]. ICN is a novel decentralized
architecture in IoT, which provides a potential approach to
cope with large-scale VR/AR content distribution in 6G enabled
massive IoT. Both VR and AR consume a large volume of band-
width to provide a satisfactory experience for the consumers.
Therefore, as an information-centric architecture, it offers in-
network caching of VR/AR content, which makes it more ideal
for a wide range of IoT devices. However, the difficulty of
multiple ICN routers cooperation in a trusted and efficient way
still poses challenges to the security and large-scale applica-
tion of ICN in 6G enabled massive IoT. Therefore, the trust
and cooperation problem of information-centric massive IoT
(IC-mIoT) needs to be solved urgently.
Blockchain is a feasible way to address the above-mentioned
trusted collaboration problem. A blockchain is a distributed
architecture that is replicated and shared among the peers of
a certain network [9]. Compared with the traditional pub-
lic blockchain, the permissioned blockchain has advantages
in terms of efficiency, cost, flexibility, and privacy protec-
tion. This provides a perfect platform for using IC-mIoT
for VR/AR content distribution in the 6G network. In this

article, an IC-mIoT architecture-based ubiquitous connected
VR/AR content caching and distribution architecture in 6G
is proposed. Meanwhile, we also proposed the corresponding
blockchain application mode and a caching consensus mecha-
nism. The goal of this article is to provide a detailed approach
of how blockchains and ICN work to realize and guaran-
tee the enhancement of ubiquitous connected VR/AR in 6G
enabled massive IoT. Therefore, motivated by previous works,
we exploit the advantages of blockchain, including permis-
sioned blockchain and consensus mechanism, to achieve the
enhancement of secure VR/AR content efficient caching and
distribution.
1) This article proposes the IC-mIoT for ubiquitous
VR/AR content distribution in 6G. To improve the effi-
ciency of IC-mIoT and fully guarantee the Quality of
Service (QoS) of users, a blockchain-enabled IC-mIoT
for VR/AR sharing architecture is proposed in this
article.
2) This article proposes a new consensus mechanism Proof-
of-Cache-Offloading (PoCO) and introduces the per-
missioned blockchain for IC-mIoT. The permissioned
blockchain is used to incentivize the VR/AR content
caching of nodes and ensure the sharing of mIoT
resources. A cache resource market for trading mIoT
device resources is proposed.
3) A cache index (CI) selection and calculation algo-
rithm and a Stackelberg game model are formulated for
blockchain-enabled cache offloading. The massive IoT
resources are fully integrated and scheduled to support
the ubiquitous VR/AR applications and IC-mIoT.
The remainder of this article is organized as follows. The
related work is given in Section II and the strengths of the
proposed scheme are described. Our system model and archi-
tecture of the proposed scheme are presented in Section III.
Both the basic implementation of the scheme and the proposed
algorithm for blockchain based cache offloading are provided
in Section IV. Simulation results are shown in Section V to
estimate the performance of the scheme. Final conclusions are
drawn in Section VI.
II. RELATED WORK
Being expected to be put into use around 2030, the oppor-
tunities, challenges, use cases and related applications of 6G
have been frequently studied and illustrated [10], [11]. Ten
important trends in the cellular industry and the outlook of
6G is proposed in [12] to shed light on possible directions
of 6G while searching for new directions and breakthroughs.
A comprehensive discussion of 6G is given in [18] based
on the review of 5G developments, covering visions and
requirements, technology trends and challenges, aiming at
tackling the challenge of coverage, capacity, the user data
rate, and movement speed of mobile communication system.
As a new multiple-access method, delta-orthogonal multiple
access (D-OMA), is introduced for massive access in future
6G cellular networks [14]. As an important part of 6G-related
technologies, some artificial intelligence (AI) methods have
been introduced into 6G networks. Tang et al. [13] provided a
survey on various machine learning (ML) techniques applied
to communication, networking, and security parts in vehicular
networks and envision the ways of enabling AI toward a future
6G vehicular network. Potential technologies for 6G to enable
mobile AI applications, as well as AI-enabled methodologies
for 6G network design and optimization are discussed in [17].
Blockchain is also being discussed in 6G as an emerging dis-
tributed architecture. The opportunities and challenges related
to blockchain usage in 6G and the possible directions for over-
taking these challenges are discussed in [15]. Hewa et al. [16]
explored the role of blockchain to address formidable chal-
lenges in 6G, future application opportunities and potential
research directions.
In 6G scenarios, extensive distributed device security
and efficient content distribution are potentially important
requirements. Therefore, both blockchain and ICN are con-
sidered potential mainstream technologies in 6G [19]–[22].
Chen et al. [23] proposed a reputation management mechanism
that combines negative and positive transaction records in the
ICN of vehicular network. Sharma et al. [24] focused on using
drones as on-demand nodes for efficient caching for the mobile-
edge computing-enabled drone network. As a content-centric
approach, ICN have been recently regarded as an alternative
to the traditional host-centric network paradigm [25]–[27].
Obvious benefits of ICN in terms of improved interest/content
sharing scheme and better reliability has already raised ICN
as a highly promising networking techeology for environ-
ments, such as IoT [8]. Information-centric technology is
integrated with fog computing for the novel content-aware
network architecture [28], [29]. For the VR/AR service,
Hu et al. [30] proposed a new architecture for UAV clustering to
enable efficient multimodal multitask offloading to enabled AI-
based the computing, caching, and communication resources.
Current state-of-the-art research on edge caching and comput-
ing with a focus on AR/VR applications and tactile Internet
is proposed in [31] to discuss applications, opportunities, and
challenges.
Although the related research on ICN and blockchain in
massive IoT has been extensively studied, few works have
focus on applying blockchain to the content sharing of 6G,
especially for the approach to supporting ubiquitous VR/AR.
Therefore, compared with the existing work, the advantages
of this article lies in the following points. First, we propose a
VR/AR content distribution architecture in 6G to meet the
requirements of 6G networks and massive IoT. Second, to
ensure the safe and stable operation of this distributed system,
we introduced the blockchain and integrated the features of
IC-mIoT with the cache offloading tasks. Third, we have
fully considered the feasibility and specific operational details
of our proposed mechanism and algorithm in 6G-enabled
massive IoT.

researchers have begun to study the 6G mobile communication
systems [32]. Human production and living space are
constantly expanding and the types and scenarios of
information interaction requirements are becoming more and
more complicated in the 6G era. The 6G network is expected
to empower millions of connected devices and ubiquitous
AR/VR applications that could operate seamlessly with high
data rates and low latency. The ubiquitous connection of
AR/VR means that the network can be expected to meet the
high-speed requirements of users at any time and any place.
These requirements are not only for the peak rate but also
the extremely high requirements for the average network rate
and coverage. As shown in Fig. 1, VR/AR content service
in 6G will penetrate into various scenarios, including the inte-
grated network of airspace, sky, earth, sea, and wireless tactile
network.
In 6G networks, there will be far more applications and
demands for VR/AR than today. To cope with more and more
VR/AR services and demands, more intensive IoT resources
will also be fully mobilized. Massive IoT devices can be
presented as a network of surrounding things which are
connecting to the Internet, such as various sensors, vehi-
cles, devices that can be monitored, detected, controlled.
The range of activities of massive IoT devices will greatly
expand the geographic space for communication access. In
6G-enabled smart cities, the content services of VR/AR
will penetrate into every corner of daily lives, including
Internet of Vehicles (IoV), UAV networks, user services, and
smart buildings. For example, VR/AR-based driving assistance
systems, VR/AR game services, VR/AR-based drone monitor-
ing systems, VR/AR movies, etc. This type of VR/AR-based
service is cached in IC-mIoT nodes to respond to requests
from edge users. Blockchain is mainly used to ensure the
safety and traceability of various transactions in 6G scenar-
ios. Meanwhile, the smart contracts that have been formed in
the past are stored in the blockchain to ensure the safe and
stable operation between the ICN routers.

B. Architecture of Blockchain-Enabled IC-mIoT for
Ubiquitous VR/AR
As shown in Fig. 2, the architecture of blockchain-enabled
IC-mIoT for VR/AR mainly includes blockchain, 6G-enabled
IC-mIoT network and a large number of IoT devices.
1) Role of Permissioned Blockchain: In this architecture,
the blockchain is mainly used to record transactions and
collaboration contracts in IC-mIoT, including VR/AR paid
content transactions, resource transactions (computing, stor-
age, graphics, communication) between ICN nodes, and IoT.
Therefore, the behavior of the node will be recorded by the

LIAO et al.: INFORMATION-CENTRIC MASSIVE IoT-BASED UBIQUITOUS CONNECTED VR/AR IN 6G 5175
blockchain to achieve traceability to monitor the behavior of
the devices participating in the IC-mIoT. The permissioned
blockchain operates the blockchain among a group of known,
identified and frequently censored participants who operate
under the governance model and generate a certain degree
of trust. The permissioned blockchain of IC-mIoT provides
a way to protect interactions between a group of entities
that share a common goal but may not fully trust each
other. Therefore, the permissioned context also provides a bet-
ter environment for the operation of some lighter consensus
mechanisms.
2) IC-mIoT Network: In the architecture of IC-mIoT, users
do not care where the acquired content comes from, they only
care what the content is. This principle makes content the first
element in the network, thus replacing the IP-centric network.
It decouples the content from the IP location and locates and
routes the requested content through a unified content name.
Compared with traditional content, VR/AR content has high
latency requirements and large data volume. Therefore, IC-
mIoT needs high-speed transmission and transmission of the
6G network to quickly spread interest packets and efficiently
distribute data packets. As a potential resource provider, IC-
mIoT nodes can request cache offloading from mIoT devices
through resource pricing. Through the transaction of resources,
ICN nodes can obtain a large amount of resources from mIoT
devices for VR/AR content services to help them have a
higher probability of being accounted, and then obtain the
revenue of transactions verification. These transactions are
stored in the permissioned blockchain composed of IC-mIoT
routers.
3) VR/AR Content Distribution: For the VR/AR content
requests from users, the IC-mIoT nodes will check whether
there are corresponding VR/AR contents that can be matched
in the current cache list to be returned. The cache list records
all the contents stored by the IC-mIoT node and the nodes
assisting in caching. According to the aforementioned cache
offloading relationship between IC-mIoT node and mIoT
devices, the corresponding cache content in the cache list can
be stored locally on the node, or on the mIoT device that
has a contractual relationship with it. If there is no matched
VR/AR content for the interest, the pending interest table (PIT)
is inquired. If there is a corresponding content item in the
PIT, then this item in PIT is updated and the interest packet
is discarded. If the interest PIT is not matched, the forward-
ing information base (FIB) is then inquired. If there exists a
matched item in the FIB, the interest packet is then forwarded
through the destination interface according to the predefined
forwarding rules and the VR/AR content of the PIT is updated.
Otherwise, this interest is discarded. On the other hand, if
the IC-mIoT node receives a VR/AR data packet, it will also
inquire the current cache list. The packet will be discarded
if the packet is already in the cache list and the PIT is then
inquired. If there exists a matched item in the PIT, the packet
is then cached and forwarded to all matching interfaces and
the entry is subsequently removed from the PIT. If no match
is found in the PIT, which means that the VR/AR content is
irrelevant to the potential service of the node, then the data
packet will be discarded.
Fig. 3. Workflow of blockchain-enabled IC-mIoT for VR/AR.
C. Workflow of Blockchain-Enabled IC-mIoT
Fig. 3 shows the main workflow of the blockchain-enabled
IC-mIoT for VR/AR sharing. For VR/AR service, the user first
sends its content request for VR/AR to IC-mIoT, and waits for
a response from the IC-mIoT. After the access node receives
the request, it will search the for corresponding content and
returns the content to the user. For the IC-mIoT node, it forms
a resource transaction with mIoT devices. Because IC-mIoT
nodes require a large amount of cache space, mIoT devices
nodes lease some of their storage space to IC-mIoT nodes.
Resource transactions between ICN nodes and mIoT are pack-
aged into blocks and recorded in the blockchain, and the
validator of the blockchain verifies the transactions. The val-
idator of the transaction in the block can thus receive a portion
of the transaction amount to receive a reward. At the same
time, the verifier must collateralize a larger amount of coins to
the blockchain. Usually, the amount is greater than the poten-
tial benefits it can obtain. If there is any false or malicious
act, that is, when the validator of the block is a malicious
node, the deposit will be seized. After the service contract
between the ICN node and the mIoT node ends, it settles the
service bill and negotiates whether to continue the contract.
If a new contract is formed between them, the transaction of
the new contract between them will continue to be recorded in
the blockchain. During this process, the IC-mIoT routers can
request cache space from mIoT to enhance its cache capacity

and mIoT devices can earn income from this. Meanwhile, to
ensure data security and trusted collaboration, the mIoT device
will also pay a deposit to the ICN node, and the deposit will
be returned at the end of the service to ensure the legality
of its actions. All of the transactions will be guaranteed and
protected by the blockchain.
IV. PROPOSED SCHEME
A. Blockchain-Based Cache Offloading
In the IC-mIoT network proposed in this article, we con-
sider the caching problem of VR/AR content, to optimize the
cache space and strategy of IC-mIoT routers to provide high
popularity content in time. To incentivize the nodes partici-
pating in IC-mIoT to try their best to provide better services
for users, in this architecture, the router can request cache
offloading to mIoT devices near it. In this way, a transaction
is formed between the routing node and the resource node of
IC-mIoT. Therefore, we use the cache utility of the nodes as
the index to serve as the basis of the consensus mechanism to
select the verifier of the transaction. All transactions, includ-
ing cache resource transactions, VR/AR content transactions,
etc., will be recorded in the blockchain waiting for verification
by the verifier. At the same time, these transactions can also
be paid through cache coins. Since block verifiers can get a
part of the transaction amount as a reward, all IC-mIoT in the
blockchain will try their best to improve their cache utility to
obtain a higher probability of becoming a block verifier.
Fig. 4 shows the architecture of the process, definitions and
algorithms of the scheme proposed in this article. The vari-
ous functions and relationships of blockchain, ICN and mIoT
are shown in detail in the figure. In general, blockchain and
IC-mIoT select validators and verify transactions. ICN will
purchase available cache-related resources from mIoT in order
to become a validator and obtain revenue. In this process,
the user’s QoS will also increase as the overall cache space
increases. The rest of this section will expand and introduce
the algorithms and definitions in detail according to the flow

and relationship of Fig. 4. Meanwhile, the main symbols used
in the model and their corresponding meanings are shown in
Table I.
B. Cache Index Selection and Weight Calculation
The measuring of the IC-mIoT node effectiveness may
include multiple aspects. Some obvious indicators, such as
cache hits and cache hit ratios, can obviously be used to
measure the effectiveness of IC-mIoT nodes. Other indica-
tors, such as the number of FIB/PIT requests, the throughput
of communications, and the total content size of nodes over
time, may also be related to the actual utility of IC-mIoT. For
many cache-related factors, our goal is to determine which fac-
tors can be used to measure the cache utility of an IC-mIoT
node and its corresponding weight. Therefore, we hope to have
a unified standard to quantitatively analyze and measure the
cache capacity of an IC-mIoT node.
Definition 1: We assume that there are cache-related stan-
dardized indicators X = {χi, χ2, . . . , χn} and corresponding
W = (w1, w2, . . . , wn). We define the following CI for ICN
and give the following calculation formula:
CI =
n∑
i=1
wi · χi i = 1, 2, . . . , n. (1)
Our goal is to collect the cache-related data of IC-mIoT
nodes, and then determine some of the indicators most relevant
to the actual utility of the cache, and quantify them. Therefore,
the main purpose of CI is to quantify the actual utility of the
cache based on the weights and corresponding data.
As the method of weight determination in this article, prin-
cipal components analysis (PCA) aims to use the idea of
dimensionality reduction to convert many and complicated
indicators into a few comprehensive indicators, which is a
Authorized licensed use limited to: CITY UNIV OF HONG KONG. Downloaded on April 15,2023 at 08:20:13 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. 
LIAO et al.: INFORMATION-CENTRIC MASSIVE IoT-BASED UBIQUITOUS CONNECTED VR/AR IN 6G 5177
technique to simplify data sets. PCA is often used to reduce
the dimension of the data set, while maintaining the feature
of the data set that contributes the most to the variance. This
is done by retaining the low-order principal components and
ignoring the high-order principal components. The algorithms
and ideas of PCA are also used in data processing and analysis
in many fields [37], [38].
In the mechanism proposed in this article, we use PCA to
determine the most important indicators and corresponding
weights that are most relevant to the cache. The calculated
weight will then be used for the election of blockchain
validators in the consensus mechanism proposed in this article.
We will first construct a standardized sample matrix for each
index X = {χi, χ2, . . . , χn} related to the ICN cache with its
corresponding sample value. The corresponding sample value
of each indicator χi is χi = (xi1, xi2, . . . , xip)
T . So we can get
the standardized matrix Zn×p = [zij] as follows:
⎧
⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨

zij = xij−xj

i = 1, 2, . . . , n

∑n
i=1 xij
n
j = 1, 2, . . . , p
s2
j =
∑n
i=1 xij−xj
n−1 .
(2)
Subsequently, we find the covariance matrix Sn×n for the
standardized data matrix Zn×p = [zij] = (Z1, Z2, . . . , Zn)
T
Sn×n =
⎛
⎜⎜⎜⎝
s11 s12 · · · s1n

⎟⎟⎟⎠
=
⎛
⎜⎜⎜⎝
Cov(Z1, Z1) Cov(Z1, Z2) · · · Cov(Z1, Zn)
Cov(Z2, Z1) Cov(Z2, Z2) · · · Cov(Z2, Zn)
...
...
. . .
...
Cov(Zn, Z1) Cov(Zn, Z2) · · · Cov(Zn, Zn)
⎞
⎟⎟⎟⎠.
(3)
We use the following formula to calculate the covariance
and construct the matrix Sn×n = [sij]:
sij = Cov
(
Zi, Zj
) = E
[
(Zi − E[Zi])
(
Zj − E[Zj]
)]
= 1
n− 1
n∑
k=1
(zki − zi)
(
zkj − zj
)
. (4)
We can obtain the eigenvalues of the matrix by solving the
above characteristic equation |λI − S| = 0 of the covariance
matrix, and arrange these features in descending order. The
eigenvalues of the matrix in descending order are denoted by
λ∗ = (λ1, λ2, . . . , λn).
According to the proportion of each feature value to the sum
of the feature values, we can select the top k indicators with
cumulative features greater than η. Usually η = 80%–85%
ConSum(k) =
∑k
i=1 λi∑n
i=1 λi
≥ η. (5)
Therefore, we can get k new comprehensive indexes, denote
as F = {F1, F2, . . . , Fk}, i = 1, 2, . . . , k, and calculate the
load of each original index on the new index Fi
lij = L
(
Fi, χj
) = √λi · aij
i = 1, 2, . . . , k, j = 1, 2, . . . , n. (6)
In the above formula, αi = (ai1, ai2,...,ain)
T is the unit eigen-
vector corresponding to λi. Therefore, we can use these load
values to calculate the weight corresponding to each original
index. We denote the weight as W = (w1, w2, . . . , wn)
wi =
∑n
k=1
(
lik · λk/
∑
λi
)
∑n
k=1 λk/
∑
λi
. (7)
Through the weight calculated by the above process and
the standardized index value, we can calculate the value of
CI, and the comprehensive CI value is associated with the IC-
mIoT cache utility. In the cache offloading scheme proposed
in this article, the verifier of the block will also periodically
collect data randomly according to the indicators to update the
weight value.
C. Proof-of-Cache-Offloading Consensus Mechanism
In the proposed mechanism, the transaction process of IC
mioT’s VR/AR content cache mainly includes but is not lim-
ited to the following aspects: 1) resource transaction between
ICN node and IoT device; 2) transaction verifier can obtain
part of the transaction amount as commission; and 3) paid
VR/AR content.
Since the election of block validator is based on the CI, all
nodes participating in the blockchain want to improve their
cache hit quantity and hit rate index to become block validator,
and then obtain the income of verification transactions
CIsum =
Ti/t∑
k=0
CI(i),k · t, (Ti = k · t ∈ T). (8)
In the above equation, t denotes the basic time period of
VR/AR content caching. In the PoCO consensus mechanism
proposed in this article, we believe that IC-mIoT nodes with
better caching performance should be given a higher proba-
bility to become a block verifier, and thus obtain benefits. If
we take N as the set of nodes participating in the PoCO con-
sensus, we can get the probability that each IC-mIoT node
becomes the final block validator as follows:
Pi = CIsum
i∑
i CIsum
i · δi
{
δi = 1, Ni ∈ N
δi = 0, Ni /∈ N.
(9)
Based on the PoCO consensus mechanism above, we have
designed the following consensus algorithm to select the
validator of the blockchain. After collecting the data corre-
sponding to the diversified indicators, the weights of these
indicators are obtained through the proposed Algorithm 1
based on PCA.
D. Stackelberg Game-Based ICN Utility Optimization
1) Problem Formulation: In the cache offloading scheme
proposed in this article, we divide the state of the IC-mIoT
routers into three types: 1) requester of cache offloading
(RoC, leader); 2) provider of cache offloading (PoC, fol-

We denote the certain cache offloading IC-mIoT requester as
RRoC, who requests assistance in caching through resource
pricing to improve its cache utility. According to the con-
nectivity of the mIoT devices, the potential resource nodes
that can provide cache offloading services are denoted as
P = {RPoC,1, RPoC,2 · · ·RPoC,n}.
To improve its cache performance and obtain a higher prob-
ability of becoming a block validator and providing better
services to users, RoC will request cache offloading from
PoC. Therefore, our goal is to satisfy the conditions of cache
offloading, while enabling RoC and PoC participating in cache
offloading to maximize their benefits.
To get the optimal cache offloading strategy between IC-
mIoT routers and the available resource mIoT devices, we
propose the game G = {SRoC, SPoC
CPoC∈P;�RoC,�PoC
CPoC∈P}. In
the game G, SRoC = {∑CPoC,i∈P τi ≥ Dmin, pmin ≤ pi ≤ pmax}
is the pricing strategy of RoC that is designed to meet its
cache offloading needs. SPoC
CPoC∈C = {τi, i ∈ N, η · Si,max ≤ τi ≤
μ·Si,max}, where τi represents the cache resources provided by
PoCi to RoC and λ ∈ [0, 1] limit the range of communication
resources provided by CPoC,i.
In G, �RoC and �PoC
CPoC∈C are the utility functions of
RoC and PoC. We use these two utility functions to mea-
sure the benefits of PoC and RoC. Given resource vector
T∗ = {τ1, τ2, . . . , τn} and price vector P∗ = {p1, p2, . . . , pn},
the objective function of RoC can be formulated as follows:
max �RoC
(
T∗, P∗
)
= ϕ
(
T∗
)− ω
(
T∗, P∗
)− C
s.t.
{
Dmin ≤∑i∈P τi, i ∈ N
pmin ≤ pi ≤ pmax.
(10)
In the above equation, ϕ(T∗) represents the revenue that
RoC obtained after obtaining PoC resources, including storage,
communication and computing resources. ω(T∗, P∗) repre-
sents the price paid by RoC for cache resources, that is, the
product of unit price and the amount of cache resources.
On the other hand, taking into account of the cache offload-
ing limitations of PoC, the objective function of PoC can be
formulated as follows:
max �PoC(τi)
= ωi(τi, pi)− εi(τi)− ei(τi)
s.t.
⎧
⎨
⎩
λ · Si,max ≤ τi ≤ η · Si,max
ei(τi) ≤ Emax
εi(τi) ≤ Commi,max.
(11)
In the above PoC utility function, ωi(τi, pi) represents the
income obtained by resource node i through resource pricing.
εi(τi) is the price that PoC needs to pay for managing the
stored content and ei(τi) is the energy cost that it needs to
pay in the above process.
Therefore, in this game, RoC purchased the cache resources
of PoC through resource pricing and used this to enhance its
effectiveness as an IC-mIoT node. For the revenue of this part,
PoC needs to sell part of its storage space and corresponding
communication resources and energy consumption. The game
proposed in this article and the utility functions of PoC and
RoC is based on the characteristic and process of IC-mIoT
and some related researches on Stackelberg game[33]–[36].
We will then introduce the specific form of the utility function
in detail as follows.
2) Utility Function Formulation: For the RoC node, its
overloaded cache space requirements will be offloaded by dif-
ferent PoC nodes. Correspondingly, the RoC will provide a
certain reward for the cache resources of the PoC according
to the cache space provided by the PoC. We set the service sat-
isfaction obtained by RoC cache offloading as an exponential
expression according to [39] and [40]. Since RoC is in a full
load state, we consider its expenditure on energy consumption
to be constant CE. We set a price to a unit of storage resource,
so the price that RoC needs to pay is the sum of the product
of price and resource. Therefore, we have the following utility
function for RoC:
{
ϕ(T∗) = e0 − kie−hi
∑
i∈P τi+r
ω(T∗, P∗) =∑i∈P pi · τi.
(12)
In the above equation, ϕ(T∗) is the effectiveness of RoC
due to the acquired cache resources. ω(T∗, P∗) is the price
that RoC pays PoC for the corresponding resources. C is a
constant part of this process. Therefore, the specific expression
of the RoC utility function is as follows:
�RoC
(
T∗, P∗
) = e0 − kie
−hi
∑
i∈P τi+r −
∑
i∈P
pi · τi − C. (13)
On the other hand, the PoC nodes need to utilize part
of the communication and energy resources for RoC cache
offloading. Therefore, although it has received a reward from
RoC, it needs to face the decline in QoS of its own users.
In addition, more communication load means a corresponding
increase in energy consumption. According to working process

of IC-mIoT, the utility function of PoC are formulated as
⎧
⎨
⎩
ωi(τi, pi) = pi · τi
εi(τi) = miln(1+ niτi)
ei(τi) = ai · τ 2
i + bi · τi + ci.
(14)
In the above equation, ωi(τi, pi) is the income that PoC
sells its cache resources. εi(τi) is the corresponding commu-
nication resource that it needs to pay. To provide cache-related
services, part of PoC’s communication resources will be occu-
pied, and this part is considered to be the cost of PoC. We set
the resource occupation of communication as a logarithmic
function. ei(τi) refers to the energy cost of the node. Therefore,
the specific expression of the PoC utility function is as follows:
�PoC(τi) = pi · τi − miln(1+ niτi)
−
(
ai · τ 2
i + bi · τi + ci
)
. (15)
In the above equation, θi is a parameter used to indicate
user QoS. For a communication system, the utility of QoS
is usually greater than energy, so αi, βi, and γi are a smaller
number for θi they are all positive numbers.
3) Calculating Nash Equilibrium: Given that T∗ =
{τ1, τ2, . . . , τn} is the cache offloading strategy of PoC and
P∗ = {p1, p2, . . . , pn} is the reward strategy of RoC, we have
the following definition.
Definition 2: In G = {SPoC
CPoC∈P;�PoC
CPoC∈P}, T∗ is the
Nash equilibrium (NE) of the game if SPoC,i if the best
response to the noncooperative subgame and �PoC(τ ∗, p∗) ≥
�PoC(τ ′, p∗).
Theorem 1: A unique NE of G = {SPoC
CPoC∈P;�PoC
CPoC∈P} exists
when the condition mi · n2
i ≤ ai is met.
Proof: In order to verify the existence of the unique NE,
we first derive the utility function of the PoC. The first deriva-
tive (∂�PoC/∂τi) and the second derivative (∂2�PoC/∂τ 2
i ) of
�PoC to τi are as follows:
∂�PoC
∂τi
= −∂ log(ni · τi + 1)mi
∂τi
− ∂aiτ
2
i + bi − τi + ci
∂τi
+ ∂pi − τi
∂τi
= pi − mi · ni
1+ ni · τi
− 2aiτi − bi. (16)
Then, we continue to find the second derivative function of
the utility function of PoC
∂2�PoC
∂τ 2
i
= ∂ − 2aiτi
∂τi
− ∂bi
∂τi

(ni·τi+1)
∂τi
+ ∂pi
∂τi
= mi · n2
i
(1+ ni · τi)
2
− 2ai. (17)
According to the above equation, (∂2�PoC/∂τ 2
i ) is a
decreasing function of τi. So (∂2�PoC/∂τ 2
i ) ≤ 0 if mi ·n2
i ≤ ai.
This gives the condition that a PoC can become a provider of
cache space. If we let (∂2�PoC/∂τ 2
i ) ≤ 0, we can get whether
a PoC is suitable for RoC to provide all kinds of resources,
which is [(min2
i )/(2 · (ni · τi + 1)2)] ≤ ai. So when mi·n2
i ≤ ai,
we have a second order function (∂2�PoC/∂τ 2
i ) ≤ 0.
If this condition is met, �PoC is convex function and a
unique NE exist in G = {SPoC
CPoC∈P;�PoC
CPoC∈P}. In addition, we
have the following price:
pi = mi · n
1+ ni · τ + 2aiτ + bi. (18)
Theorem 2: A unique Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) exists in
game G = {SRoC, SPoC
CPoC∈P;�RoC,�PoC
CPoC∈P} when mi · n2
i ≤ ai.
So that the pricing strategy P∗ = {p1, p2, . . . , pn} can
maximize the benefits of RoC.
Proof: In order to verify the existence of the unique SE,
we first derive the utility function of the RoC. The first deriva-
tive (∂�RoC/∂τi) and the second derivative (∂2�RoC/∂τ 2
i ) of
�PoC to τi are as follows by using (9):
∂�RoC
∂τi

− mi · ni
1+ ni · τi
+ mi · n2 · τi
(1+ ni · τi)
2
. (19)
Then, we continue to find the second derivative function of
the utility function of RoC
∂2�RoC
∂τ 2
i
= chk · ∂e(−h · τi + r)
∂τi

− 2mi · n3 · τi
(1+ ni · τi)

. (20)
By using the condition of [(min2
i )/(2 · (ni · τi + 1)2)] ≤ ai
in Theorem 1, we have the following inequality:
∂2�RoC
∂τ 2
i
≤ −c · h2 · k · e−h·τi+r − 2mi · n3
i · τi
(1+ ni · τi)

Therefore, the unique SE of the game G =
{SRoC, SPoC
CPoC∈P;�RoC,�PoC
CPoC∈P} exists and the cache
offloading strategy τ ∗ = {τ1, τ2, . . . , τn} can be found.
When mi · n2
i ≤ ai, we have (∂2�RoC/∂τ 2

to (20), the following Hessian matrix is a diagonal matrix:

Therefore, in a IC-mIoT system, if the aforementioned
mi · n2
i ≤ ai is met, we can find an optimal cache offload-
ing strategy. Therefore, the unique SE of the game G =
{SRoC, SPoC
CPoC∈P;�RoC,�PoC
CPoC∈P} exists and the cache offload-
ing strategy T∗ = {τ1, τ2, . . . , τn} can be found using the
following algorithm.
E. Cache Strategy Algorithm Based on Reinforcement
Learning
The above two theorems and their proofs show that we
can find a pricing strategy and corresponding cache offload-
ing method to maximize the effectiveness of PoC and RoC.
However, the maximum value of the above utility function (13)
is difficult to find a specific solution in an analytical way.
Therefore, we will use reinforcement learning to find an
optimal value with acceptable error.
We define ut as the instantaneous utility value gener-
ated at time t. For the cache offloading strategy � =
{τ1, τ2, . . . , τn} ∈T, the decision-making agent can calculate
the real-time utility value by the following formula:
ut(τi) = �RoC
(
T∗, P∗
) = e0 − kie

i∈P τi+r
−
∑
i∈P
(
mi · n
1+ ni · τi
+ 2aiτi + bi
)
· τi − C. (24)
In each attempt, the action-value function J(Dt,�t) can be
updated by the following formula:
J(Dt,�t)← ui + γ min
�′t+1
J
(
Dt,�
′
t+1
)
. (25)
After the action-value function J(Dt,�t) is determined, the
operation strategy can be updated according to the following
formula:
π(Dt)← argmin�′t J
(
Dt,�
′
t+1
)
. (26)
Based on the above system model and mathematical deriva-
tion, we have designed the following algorithm to find the best
mIoT device collaboration model. The proposed Algorithm 2
is based on the above main formulas. After obtaining the
information of the utility function, it can gradually explore
the optimal solution under the restricted conditions.
V. SIMULATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS
In this section, we carried out detailed simulations and
experiments on the algorithms and schemes proposed in this
article. The efficiencies and explanations of the proposed
scheme are given in this section by a series of comparisons
and results, including the results and theoretical analysis of
the Stackelberg game, the simulation of the consensus mech-
anism and the impact of this mechanism on the cache, etc.
Our scheme is simulated based on MATLAB, which is run-
ning on a server with Intel i7 6700 CPU and 16-GB RAM. We
establish the IC-mIoT network and nodes, simulate the behav-
iors and functions of IC-mIoT routers and resource nodes. We
established an IC-mIoT network and assumed that some of
the router nodes can obtain various resources of nearby mIoT
devices to enhance their capabilities. The IC-mIoT router has
its own storage space and computing power. By determin-
ing its own storage space requirements, it requests storage
resources from nearby available resource nodes. Then mIoT
nodes provide corresponding supporting storage, computing
and communication services. The service utility of the IC-
mIoT router has also improved. The main variables simulated
in this article include cache space requirements, available
cache resources, consensus mechanism, etc.
First, we simulated the game process between the IC-mIoT
router and the mIoT resource nodes. Through the simulation
of the reinforcement learning algorithm proposed by this arti-
cle and the utility functions of both parties. Fig. 5 shows the
changes of various indicators with the increase of resource
demand. Specific indicators include PoC utility, RoC utility,
average resource price, and PoC resource utilization. The ben-
efits of PoC and RoC is the most intuitive expression used to
measure the utility of IC-mIoT nodes and mIoT devices. The
corresponding average cache resource price and utilization rate
can provide a macroperspective. As shown in Fig. 5(a), we
can see that when more resource nodes contribute resources
to IC-mIoT, the effectiveness of RoC will increase. It is worth
mentioning that when the demand for resources is too large,
the utility of RoC may also decline. Fig. 5(b) shows the ben-
efits of PoC. The higher the resource demand, the higher the
utility PoC will be, and when there are fewer resource nodes,
the PoC will get higher returns. Fig. 5(c) shows that the aver-
age cache resource price is affected by the total cache demand.
The price of resources will increase as nodes and demand
increase. Fig. 5(d) shows that the cache utilization ratio of
resource nodes will increase with the increase of demand and
the number of nodes under the proposed scheme.
In the experiment of Fig. 5, we studied the changes of the
above indicators with the number of resource nodes and made
comparative experiments under different benefit parameters h.
The h in the utility function is mainly used to reflect the over-
all level that the cache resource can bring to the RoC. As
shown in Fig. 6(a), the utility of RoC will increase with the

increase of available resource nodes. And with the increase
of the parameter h, RoC’s income is rising, which is con-
sistent with the meaning of h. Fig. 6(b) shows that with the
increase of resource nodes, the benefit of PoC will decrease.
If the same resources can bring more efficient use to RoC,
that is, the value of h is larger, the benefit of PoC is lower.
This phenomenon has a similar conclusion in the price of
cache resources. In Fig. 6(c), the larger the number of resource
nodes, the more potential RoC resources available, so the price
of cache resources will also decrease accordingly. The result
of Fig. 6(d) is also very obvious. More resource nodes will
reduce the cache resource utilization. A higher h also means
that RoC can make better use of cache resources and reduce
cache utilization.
Further, we studied whether the way IC-mIoT routers
request resource storage from resource nodes through resource
pricing can improve the overall performance and effective-
ness of the IC-mIoT network. Therefore, we compared the
resource changes of the IC-mIoT router before and after using
the cache offloading mechanism proposed in this article in
Fig. 7. We can clearly see that the storage resources of IC-
mIoT have been improved. As we all know, more storage
space can significantly improve the service quality of the ICN
network. Without cache offloading, the cache resources of IC-
mIoT nodes are limited. However, permissioned blockchains
have certain access conditions, which means that not all nodes
can join the system. Therefore, through the cache offloading
mechanism proposed in this article, IC-mIoT nodes and mIoT
devices form certain restrictive relationships. Thanks to the
addition of mIoT devices, the overall cache performance of
the system has also been improved.
We also simulated the impact of different consensus mech-
anisms on the IC-mIoT network. We compared the PoCO
consensus mechanism proposed in this article with the
Fig. 7. Effect of the proposed scheme on the cache space.
traditional Proof of Work (PoW). Fig. 8 compares the two
consensus machines from three aspects: 1) cache hit rate;
2) cache hit number; and 3) node traffic. As shown in Fig. 8(a)
and (b), the number of cache hits and the cache hit rate of the
transaction validators selected by PoCO are significantly bet-
ter. Because the consensus process of PoCO fully considers
the cache resources, these two indicators are the most able to
reflect the cache effectiveness. Fig. 8(c) compares the through-
put of the nodes selected under the two consensus mechanisms.
The higher throughput indicates that the content resources of
the node are more abundant. This further proves that PoCO
is more suitable for the environment of IC-mIoT. The calcu-
lation of PoW mainly depends on the computing resources
of the node, and the PoCO proposed in this article mainly
measures the cache capacity of the node, and the consensus
process does not require a lot of resources.

VI. CONCLUSION
In this article, we focused on building an IC-mIoT network
to achieve ubiquitous VR/AR services in women 6G. We
introduced an ICN architecture for mIoT, and made full use
of the characteristics of 6G to provide users with ubiqui-
tous VR/AR services. Through the improvement of the basic
idea and application architecture of the blockchain, we have
designed a brand new consensus mechanism PoCO to pro-
tect various types of content and resource transactions in
IC-mIoT. In addition, this article also designed the correspond-
ing algorithm for consensus mechanism PoCO index selection
and optimal cache offloading strategy between nodes. The
simulation results fully illustrate the superiority and feasibility
of the scheme proposed in this article.
With the gradual deployment of 5G networks, the applica-
tion, architecture and challenges of future 6G networks are
very worth looking forward to. For future work, we hope to
further explore the problems brought by the characteristics of
the 6G network in the application, as well as the possibility
of fully mobilizing and utilizing the large-scale edge nodes in
the 6G network.
