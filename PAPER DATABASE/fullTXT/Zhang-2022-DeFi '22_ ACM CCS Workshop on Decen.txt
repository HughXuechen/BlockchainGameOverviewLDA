ABSTRACT
Powered by blockchains, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has grown
to a significant economy covering exchanges, borrowing/lending,
margin trading, derivatives, and more. While DeFi systems are gain-
ing significant traction (e.g., they already manage tens of billions
of dollars worth of assets), making them secure has proven excep-
tionally challenging—a staggering $1.9 billion was stolen in various
hacks in the first seven months of 2022 alone [4].
The challenge faced by the research community is twofold. First,
DeFi gives rise to new security problems (such as MEV) that ex-
isting methods cannot effectively address. Second, understanding
DeFi and its security and privacy implications requires knowledge
from a wide range of subjects, such as consensus, game theory,
programming language, economics, politics, etc. The goal of this
workshop is to bring together researchers from many different
fields to jointly advance the understanding of DeFi security and
develop newmethods and solutions leveraging the interdisciplinary
expertise of the community.

1 INTRODUCTION
Trusted intermediaries have dominated economic interactions for
centuries. With the advent of decentralized ledgers, such as Bit-
coin and Ethereum, people can now trade and interact without
trusting centralized custodians. Recently, Decentralized Finance

(DeFi) grew to a USD +$100 Billion economy covering exchanges,
borrowing/lending, margin trading, derivatives, and more.
The security properties of DeFi have to date not received much
scrutinity or attention. Indeed, both old security problems (such
as buggy smart contracts, key management failures) and new ones
(such as MEV, flash loan attacks) rampage and have cost billions
of dollars in loss. Beyond loss of funds, DeFi security problems
have profound security and economic impact. For example, recent
works (such as [1, 5]) have shown that Miner Extractable Value
(MEV) can destabilize the blockchain’s consensus security. At the
network layer, the overhead due to competitive DeFi trading may
further destabilize the blockchain’s consensus and lead to excessive
overhead and ultimately high transaction fees, as we havewitnessed
on permissionless blockchains.
Due to its interdisciplinary nature, solving security and privacy
problems in DeFi require knowledge in not only computer security,
but also consensus, finance, economics, and so on. For example,
while several streams of technical solutions have been proposed to
mitigate the negative impact of MEV (such as [2, 3] to name a few),
the awareness of the issue in other communities (such as among
economists and legal experts) remain limited. However, few venues
exist for researchers in these areas to publish in and exchange ideas.
The purpose of this workshop is to unite researchers with deep
knowledge in the many subfields of DeFi (network, consensus,
game theory, programming language, economics and security), to
jointly revisit their security and privacy properties. The primary
aim of the workshop is to elaborate on how we can protect DeFi
users from malicious trading entities and what kind of attacks
those could mount. The workshop, therefore, solicited novel works
that refine the fundamental tensions between security, privacy,
usability, economic efficiency and performance of DeFi. Second,
the workshop aims to provide an academic forum for scholars to
exchange, through breaks as well as to participate in an open panel
discussion.
2 WORKSHOP FORMAT
The workshop will consist of a keynote talk, paper presentation,
social breaks, and a panel. Two types of papers will be presented.
• Original research papers: The workshop has accepted ten
original papers that have not been published or concurrently
submitted to other venues. Accepted papers address DeFi
security challenges drawing on game theory, economics,
finance, applied cryptography, networking, etc, achieving
our goal of bringing together experts from various fields.
• Recently published papers: We plan to invite a small number
of recently published papers that are particularly relevant to
the workshop.

We will mix the presentation of both types of papers. Lightning
talks can be placed conveniently during the middle of the workshop,
while a panel among invited panelists finalizes the workshop day.
