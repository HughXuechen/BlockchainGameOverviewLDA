and visual features

Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are digital assets that represent objects like art, collectible, and in-game 
items. They are traded online, often with cryptocurrency, and are generally encoded within smart 
contracts on a blockchain. Public attention towards NFTs has exploded in 2021, when their market has 
experienced record sales, but little is known about the overall structure and evolution of its market. 
Here, we analyse data concerning 6.1 million trades of 4.7 million NFTs between June 23, 2017 
and April 27, 2021, obtained primarily from Ethereum and WAX blockchains. First, we characterize 
statistical properties of the market. Second, we build the network of interactions, show that traders 
typically specialize on NFTs associated with similar objects and form tight clusters with other traders 
that exchange the same kind of objects. Third, we cluster objects associated to NFTs according 
to their visual features and show that collections contain visually homogeneous objects. Finally, 
we investigate the predictability of NFT sales using simple machine learning algorithms and find 
that sale history and, secondarily, visual features are good predictors for price. We anticipate that 
these findings will stimulate further research on NFT production, adoption, and trading in different 
contexts.
“WTF are NFTs? Why crypto is dominating the art market” is the title of the February 21, 2021 episode of The 
Art Newspaper  podcast1, signalling both the impact of Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the art world and the 
novelty they represent for most of the general public. The revolution is not confined to the art market. While 
NFT adoption in gaming has already reached a certain maturity, for example concerning the trade of in-game 
objects, different other industries, especially those involved with the production of digital content such as music 
or video, are experimenting with the technology. Overall, in the first four months of 2021, the NFT volume has 
exceeded 2 billion USD, ten times more than the entire NFT trading volume in  20202.
So, what’s an NFT? An NFT is a unit of data stored on a blockchain that certifies a digital asset to be unique 
and therefore not interchangeable, while offering a unique digital certificate of ownership for the  NFT3. More 
broadly, an NFT allows to establish the “provenance” of the assigned digital object, offering indisputable answers 
to such questions as who owns, previously owned, and created the NFT, as well as which of the many copies is 
the original. Several types of digital objects can be associated to an NFT including photos, videos, and audio. 
NFTs are now being used to commodify digital objects in different contexts, such as art, gaming, and sports 
collectibles. Originally NFTs were part of the Ethereum blockchain but increasingly more blockchains have 
implemented their own versions of  NFTs4.
The first popular example of NFTs is CryptoKitties, a collection of artistic images representing virtual cats 
that are used in a game on Ethereum that allows players to purchase, collect, breed, and sell them on  Ethereum5. 
In December 2017, CryptoKitties congested the Ethereum  network6. By many considered a chief example of the 
irrationality driving the cryptocurrency market in  20177, CryptoKitties remained the only popular example of 
NFTs for almost 2 years. In July 2020, the NFT market started to  grow2 and attracted a huge attention in March 
2021, when the artist known as Beeple sold an NFT of his work for $69.3 million at Christie’s8. The purchase 
resulted in the third-highest auction price achieved for a living artist, after Jeff Koons and David  Hockney9. Sev-
eral other record sales  followed10,11: three Cryptopunks—a collection of 10,000 unique automatically generated 
digital characters—were sold at $11.8, $7.6, and $7.6 million dollars, respectively; the first tweet was sold at $2.9

million dollars; and the Auction Winner Picks Name, an NFT with music video and dance track, sold at $1.33 
million dollars. The profitability of NFTs has motivated celebrities to create their own NFTs, with collectibles of 
NBA and famous football players getting sold for hundreds of thousands  dollars12.
Research on NFTs is still limited, and focuses mostly on technical aspects, such as copyright  regulations3; 
components, protocols, standards, and desired  properties13; new blockchain-based protocols to trace physical 
 goods14; and the implications that NFTs have on the art  world15,16, in particular as they allow to share secondary 
sale royalties with the artist. Empirical studies aiming at characterizing properties of the market have focused 
on a limited number of NFT collections, such as,  CryptoKitties17,18, Cryptopunks, and  Axie19, or on a single 
NFT market, such as,  Decentraland19,20 or  SuperRare21,22. These analyses revealed that the digital abundance of 
NFTs in digital games has led to a substantial decrease of their  value17, and that, even if NFT prices are driven by 
the prices of  cryptocurrencies19, the NFT market could be prone to  speculation18,20. Further, it was shown that 
NFTs valued by experts are more  successful21, and that, based on 16,000 NFTs sold on the SuperRare market, the 
structure of the the NFT co-ownership network is highly centralized, and small-world-like22,23.
In this paper, we provide a first comprehensive quantitative overview of the NFT market. To this end, we ana-
lyse a large dataset including 6.1 million trades of 4.7 million NFTs in 160 cryptocurrencies, primarly Ethereum 
and WAX, and covering the period between June 23, 2017 and April 27, 2021. We start by analysing the overall 
statistical properties of the NFT market and its evolution over time. Then, we study the network of interactions 
between NFT traders, and the network of NFT assets. NFTs are further clustered based on their visual features. 
Finally, we present the results of regression and classification models predicting the occurrence of NFT second-
ary sales and their price.
We break down our analysis by NFT categories, which are classified by manual inspection, with references 
to the classification proposed by NonFungible  Corporation24, a specialized company that track NFTs sales, 
and  OpenSea25, one of the largest NFT marketplace. However, the exact classification of different categories in 
which NFTs are used is outside of the scope of the present paper. For example, Art objects can be in some cases 
classified as Collectibles, while some Game objects may present sophisticated aesthetic and cultural properties 
that may qualify them as Art.
Results
The NFT market. Items exchanged on the NFT market are organized in collections, sets of NFTs that, in 
most cases, share some common features. Collections can be widely different in nature, from sets of collectible 
cards, to selections of art masterpieces, to virtual spaces in online games. Most collections can be categorised in 
six categories: Art, Collectible, Games, Metaverse, Other, and Utility (see also “SI”). We show the top 5 collections 
in terms of number of unique assets (n) for each category (see Fig. 1a).
Following an initial rapid growth in late 2017, when CryptoKitties collection gained worldwide popularity, 
the size of the NFT market has remained substantially stable until mid 2020, with an average of ∼ 60 000 US 
dollars traded daily (see Fig. 1b). Starting from July 2020, the market has experienced a dramatic growth, with 
the total volume exchanged daily surpassing ∼ 10 million US dollars in March 2021, thus becoming 150 times 
larger than it was 8 months earlier.
We measured to what extent different NFTs categories contribute to the size of the whole NFT market. Until 
the end of 2018, the market was fully dominated by the Art category, and in particular by the CryptoKitties col-
lection. From January 2019, other categories started gaining popularity, both in terms of total volume exchanged 
(see Fig. 1b,c) and number of transactions (see Fig. 1d). Overall, in the period between January 2019 and July 
2020, ∼ 90% of the total volume exchanged on NFT was shared by the Art, Games, and Metaverse categories, 
contributing 18% , 33% , and 39% respectively. Starting from mid July 2020, the market volume has been largely 
dominated by NFTs categorized as Art, which, since then, have contributed ∼ 71% of the total transaction volume, 
followed by Collectible assets accounting for 12% . Importantly, however, the market composition is quite different 
when considering the number of transactions. Since July 2020, the most exchanged NFTs belong to the categories 
Games and Collectible, which account for 44% and 38% of transactions. Instead, only 10% of transactions are 
related to NFTs categorized as Art. Overall, we observe that the share of volume spent in Art has been growing 
since 2020, while its share of transactions has been decreasing (Fig. 1d). The discrepancy between volume and 
transactions reveals that prices of items categorized as Art are higher, on average, compared to other categories.
We dig further into these differences by looking at the distribution of NFT prices across categories (see 
Fig. 2a), which we find to be broadly distributed. We observe that the average sale price of NFTs is lower than 15 
dollars for 75% of the assets, and larger than 1594 dollars, for 1% of the assets. Considering individual categories, 
NFTs categorized as Art, Metaverse, and Utility reached higher prices compared to other categories, with the top 
1% of assets having average sale price higher than 6290, 9485, and 12,756 dollars respectively. Note that these 
categories are different in sizes, so 1% of assets corresponds to 8593, 472, and 78 NFTs in the Art, Metaverse, and 
Utility categories, respectively. The highest prices so far were reached by assets categorized as Art, with 4 NFTs 
that were sold for more than 1 million dollars.
To assess the market activity, we measured how often individual assets are traded. Here, we refer to the first 
time an asset is sold as the asset’s primary sale, and to all other sales as secondary sales. All assets considered 
in this study had a primary sale, but only ∼ 20% of them had a secondary sale (see “SI”). We observe that the 
tail of the distribution of number of sales s per asset, for s ≥ 10 , is well characterized by a power-law function 
P(s) ∼ sβ , with β = −1.4 , estimated  following26 (see Fig. 2b). When looking at different categories, the distribu-
tion of number of sales is affected by cut-off values. For example, the maximum number of sales for assets in the 
Utility category is 12, while an asset in the Games category is sold more than a thousand times, and an asset in 
the Art category more than five thousands times. Note that only 0.07% of all assets are sold more than 10 times. 
Also, the size of collections n is well described by a power-law function P(n) ∼ nα , with α = −1.5 (see Fig. 2c),

implying the distribution of sizes is broad. We find that ∼ 75% of collections comprise less than 37 unique assets, 
and ∼ 1% have more than 10,400 unique assets.
Temporal patterns of secondary sales are unique for each collection, as evidenced by considering the top col-
lection in each category (see Fig. 3). For example, when Cryptokitties emerged in 2017, secondary sale prices were 
typically lower than the price of their first sale. More recently in 2021, instead, their secondary sale prices have 
gone up because of an increase in the number of potential customers. Other collections, like Alien, alternated 
periods when secondary sale prices went down and period when they went up. In the Unstoppable collection 
secondary sales are rare because NFTs correspond to web domains secured by blockchain technology. In 2017, 
secondary sale price were lower than primary in 66% of the cases, while in 2021 only 27% of secondary sales 
had lower prices than the primary one.
The networks of NFT trades. How do traders interact with each other? Are there central actors? We 
approach these questions adopting a network science  approach23,27. We consider the network of trades, where 
nodes are traders, a directed link from a trader to another exists if the former (the buyer) purchases at least one 
NFT from the latter (the seller). Each link has a weight corresponding to the total number of items that the buyer 
bought from the seller.
First, we study the behaviour of individual NFT traders by focusing on properties of the nodes. We find that 
traders activity is highly heterogeneous: the strength of traders (nodes) s, defined as the total number of purchases 
and sales made by each trader, is distributed as a power law P(s) ∼ s�1 with exponent �1 = −1.85 (see Fig. 4a), 
such that the top 10% of traders alone perform 85% of all transactions and trade at least once 97% of all assets. 
Further, we find a superlinear relation between the strength of a trader and the total number of days of activity 
d, with s ∼ d�2 and �2 = 1.28 (see Fig. 4b). This result reveals that the average number of daily trades is larger for 
traders active over long periods of time. Traders are also specialized: measuring how individuals distribute their 
trades across collections, we find that traders perform at least 73% of their transactions in their top collection, 
while at least 82% in their top two collections combined. The relation between strength and specialization is 
not monotonic: the most specialized traders have either few (less than ten) or many (more than ten thousands) 
transactions (see Fig. 4c). A specialized trader is the one with Ethereum address “0xfc624f8f58db41bdb95ae-
dee1de3c1cf047105f1”, that exchanges tens of thousands of CryptoKitties. Similar relationships hold when buying 
and selling behaviours are considered separately (see “SI”).
Secondly, we turn to properties of the network links, describing interactions between pairs of traders. We 
find that the distribution of link weights is well characterized by a power law distribution, with the top 10% of 
buyer–seller pairs contributing to the total number of transactions as much as the remaining 90% (see “SI”). An 
interesting question is whether traders connect preferentially to traders that have similar strength. We tackle this 
question by studying the assortativity coefficient r28, that measures the correlation between the sum of the weights 
of all outgoing links (the outgoing strength) of a given node with the average sum of the weights of incoming 
links (the incoming strength) of its neighbours. We find that the assortativity, which takes value r = −0.024 ,

is close to the null value zero, implying that traders do not connect to other traders based on the similarity of 
their connection patterns.
Finally, we focus on the network structure. Building upon the result that traders are specialized, we assign 
each trader to their top collection, and we study the  modularity29 of the network under this partition of nodes. 
The modularity is a metric bounded between −0.5 and 1, which is positive when the density of links among 
nodes assigned to the same partition is larger than it would be expected by chance. We find that the modular-
ity Q of the collections partition is Q = 0.613 , significantly higher than what expected from a random network 
Q = 0.0823± 0.0001 (see “SI”). It reveals that the collections well represent the underlining network structure, 
where traders specialized in a collection tends to buy and sell NFTs with other traders specialized in the same 
collection.
We now turn to the exploration of how NFTs are connected to one another. To this end, we construct the 
network of NFTs, where nodes are NFTs and a directed link exists between two NFTs that are purchased “in 
sequence”, e.g. a link is created from an NFT to another when a buyer purchases the former and then the latter, 
with no purchases between the two (see “SI” for more details). Rather than linking all NFTs ever traded by the 
same trader, this choice allows to understand the relations between NFT that are semantically similar, because 
they are bought by the same trader in approximately the same period of time. Further, it ensures that the network 
structure is not dominated by large cliques.
The distribution of NFTs strength decays as a power law with exponent �3 = −3.21 (see Fig. 4d). Note that 
the strength of NFTs is different to the total number of sales per NFT (previously shown in Fig. 2b), due to how 
the network is constructed. In fact, when two NFTs are purchased simultaneously, this creates two links for each 
of the two nodes (one ingoing and one outgoing). The next question we ask is: which NFTs are connected to one 
another? We find that NFTs in small collections tend to be bought in sequence with NFTs in other collections 
(see Fig. 4e). On the contrary, NFTs in large collections, like CryptoKitties or Gods-Unchained, tend to be bought 
in sequence with NFTs in the same collection.
What are the implications of this behaviour on the NFT network structure? We investigate the relation 
between the structure of the NFT network and NFTs collections, by studying the  modularity29 of the network 
under the partition of NFTs (nodes) into NFT collections. We find that the modularity Q of the collections 
partition is Q = 0.80 , significantly higher than what expected from a random network Q = 0.1110± 0.0001 . 
It reveals that (1) the network is clustered and (2) the collections well represent the underlining community 
structure. By further exploring the relationship between traders’ behaviour and NFT networks structure, we 
unveil that, while the NFT network is clustered, communities are not isolated. That is, some traders buy or sell 
assets belonging to multiple collections. The network of NFTs has two strongly connected components (SCC)30, 
defined as groups of nodes such that, starting from a given NFTs, it is possible to reach any other NFTs in the 
SCC following directed links. The largest SCC include NFTs traded in the WAX blockchain, consisting of 35% 
of all NFTs, while the second largest includes NFTs traded in the Ethereum blockchain, consisting of 20% of 
all NFTs (see Fig. 4f). While the high network modularity reveals that traders tend to purchase assets from the 
same collection in sequence, the presence of very large SCCs reveals that there are less frequent sequences of 
purchases in different collections.
A visual representation of the trader network including the Art category on February 2021 shows the clusters 
formed by NFT traders specialized in the same collection (see Fig. 5a). Similarly, the same visualization for the

NFT network shows a similar trend, where NFTs, albeit surrounded by other NFTs in the same collection, tend 
to form a sparser structure (see Fig. 5b).
We then study the networks consisting of assets in the same category and blockchain (see “SI”). We find that 
key results presented above, including the shape of the strength distributions, hold across categories. Also in this 
case, we find that traders, independently from the category considered, are specialized: the fraction of individual 
trades in the top collection is included between 59%, for the Other category, and 98%, for the Utility category. 
Similarly, the fraction of individual trades in the top collection is 70% for the WAX blockchain and 91% for the 
Ethereum blockchain category. Relative to the number of total NFTs in each category, the WAX component con-
tains 55.0% of all NFTs labeled as Collectible, but only the 0.06% of all NFTs labeled as Utility. On the contrary, 
the Ethereum component has the 54.8% of all Art, but only the 10.6% of Games.
Visual features. NFTs are linked to digital assets of different types, including videos, text, animated GIFs, 
and audio. Currently, the most popular NFTs are  images10,11. We select NFTs associated with images and take a 
snapshot of animated GIFs, and analyse them with the pre-trained convolution neural network AlexNet. AlexNet 
extracts from an image a vector of 4096 values that is a dense representation of the image’s visual features. With 
this representation, vectors extracted from images that are visually similar are close in the vector space. To 
quantify the visual difference between pairs of pictures, we calculated the cosine distance (CD) between them, a 
value that goes from zero (for identical images) to one (for highly different images). We measured such distance 
between pictures within the same collection and across collections.
The average CD calculated between items which belong to the same collection is significantly lower ( µ = 0.59 , 
σ = 0.20 ) compared to the one obtained for objects from two different collections ( µ = 0.87 , σ = 0.06 ), con-
firming an intra-collection graphical homogeneity. Figure 6a shows the matrix of average CD values between all 
pairs of collections. Values on the diagonal represent the intra-collection CD values, and reveal that most col-
lections have a high degree of homogeneity (e.g., Sorare (CD = 0.24) or Cryptopunks (CD = 0.33)) but some are 
more heterogeneous (Rarible (CD = 0.89)). In short, many collections have their own style, graphical hallmarks 
that distinguish them from others. There are also sub-groups of collections, usually within the same category 
(coloured band in Fig. 6a), which share some common visual features. This is the case for collections containing 
pieces of pixel-art, including Chubbie, Cryptopunks and Wrapped Punks, or the similarities observed between 
Cryptokitties and Axie.
To map the images into a lower-dimensional feature space that can be used in practice for prediction and visu-
alization, we apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the AlexNet vectors. PCA uses linear combinations 
of the 4096-dimensional vectors to project them into vectors with an arbitrarily lower number of dimensions 
and such that the variance of datapoints in the projected space is maximized. Considering the whole sample,

which consists of about 1.25 million graphical objects, the first five principal components explain together about 
the 38.3% of the total variance, progressively distributed from PC1 to PC5 as follow: 20.3%, 7.3%, 4.0%, 3.8% 
and 2.7%. The PC1 to PC5 scores are used to test the capacity of visual features for predicting sales (see next 
subsection), while PC1, PC2, and PC3 for visually representing the data through a 3D scatter plot and showing 
intra-categories homogeneity (see Fig. 6b). This can be quantified by looking at the average Euclidean distance 
in the PC1, PC2, PC3 space between objects of the same category and comparing it to the one calculated among 
objects of different categories. Considering the whole sample and calculating the distance between all the points, 
the average value obtained between elements of different categories is 1.67 bigger than for elements of the same 
category. However, as we already described for the cosine distance in the AlexNet vector space, this is mainly due 
to the intra-collections homogeneity, as demonstrated calculating the average inter-collection distance which 
results more than three times (3.17) bigger than the intra-collection distance and secondarily to the presence of 
intra-categories clusters of similar looking collections. This is most likely caused by the market responsiveness 
to the success of a collection, which induces other creators to follow the trend and offer variations on the theme.
Predicting sales. To identify the factors associated with an NFT’s market value, we fit a linear regression 
model to estimate the price of primary and secondary sales from different sets of features, calculated considering 
only the data preceding the day of the NFT’s primary sale. The features (whose detailed formulations are pro-
vided in “SI”) include the degree and PageRank centrality of the buyer and seller in the networks of NFT trades 
( kbuyer|seller , PRbuyer|seller ), the principal components of visual features of the object linked to the NFT ( visPCA1...5
 ), 
a prior probability of sale within the collection ( presale ), and the past median price of primary and secondary 
sales within the collection ( median price).
NFT’s price correlates strongly with the price of NFTs previously sold within the same collection (see “SI”). 
The median sale price of NFTs in the collection predicts more than half of the variance of price of future primary 
and secondary sales. The prediction is more accurate when the median of the past sale price is calculated over a 
recent time window preceding the primary sale, e.g., the prior time window of one week is better than considering 
the entire time window preceding the NFT’s primary sale. Similar results, albeit with generally lower correla-
tions, are found when the secondary sale price is the object of the regression (see “SI”). As one would expect, 
the price of secondary sales is strongly correlated with the price of primary sale, and the predictive power of the 
variables declines as one attempts to cast a prediction over longer periods of time: R2
adj = 0.90 when predicting 
the median secondary sale price over the next week, and falls to R2
adj = 0.77 when extending the prediction over 
the next 2 years (see “SI”). A similar relation is found between the secondary sale price and the median price of 
the NFTs collection (see “SI”).
Other features than prior sale history are predictive of future primary sale price (see Fig.  7a) and 
median secondary sale price (see Fig. 7b). Centrality measures of the buyer and seller in the trader network 
( R2
adj ∈ [0.05, 0.12] ) and visual features of the object linked to the NFT ( R2
adj ∈ [0, 0.08] ) explain roughly one-fifth 
to one-fourth of the variance when used in combination ( R2
adj ∈ [0.18, 0.25] ). When considered in combination 
with the median price of previous sales, they increase the predictive power by almost 10% for the secondary 
sale price ( R2
adj from 0.55 to 0.6). When fitting separate regressions for each category, it becomes apparent that

For visualization purposes, we downsampled the digital objects associated with the CryptoKitties and Sorare 
collections, which alone constitute the 61% of the whole dataset.

the predictability of future prices and the predictive power of different sets of features varies depending on 
the NFT category. The collectible category is the easiest to predict, with centrality and visual features yielding 
R2
adj ∈ [0.30, 0.36] and R2
adj ∈ [0.40, 0.50] , respectively. These two families of features have the largest compound 
effect in the Art category; in the secondary sale price prediction, centrality features boost the predictive power 
of visual features by more than 50%. Regression coefficients of individual features for the task of secondary sale 
price prediction one month after the primary sale are presented in Table 1.
When predicting secondary sale prices, we consider only those NFTs that were sold in a secondary sale. These 
NFTs are the minority: less than 10% are sold at least once within one week after the primary sale, and only about 
22% within 1 year (see “SI”). Using the same set of features that we selected for the price regression, we trained 
 AdaBoost32, a binary classifier, to assess to what extent it is possible to predict whether an NFT will be sold after 
its primary sale (for more details see in “SI”). We find that this is possible to a certain extent. The prediction is 
most accurate when training and testing the classifier on Art NFTs only ( F1 > 0.8 ), whereas the prediction is 
less reliable for the other categories ( F1 ∈ [0.14, 0.33] , see “SI”). The median price of the collection is among the 
strongest predictors, but not always the strongest. The prior probability of sale in the collection is also a strong 
signal, and centrality and visual features combined can sometimes outperform other feature combinations (e.g., 
in the Metaverse category). Last, the prediction is most accurate when trying to predict the occurrence of a 
secondary sale over longer periods of time (see “SI”).
Conclusion
The NFT market is less than four years old and has boomed in 2021. This paper presented the first overview of 
some key aspects of it by looking at the market history of 6.1 million NFT trades across six main NFT categories 
including art, games and collectibles. In brief, (1) we analyzed the main properties of the market, (2) we built 
and studied the traders and NFTs networks and found that most traders are specialised, (3) we showed that NFT 
collections tend to be visually homogeneous, and (4) we explored the predictability of NFT prices revealing that, 
while past history is as expected the best predictor, also NFT specific properties, such as the visual features of 
the associated digital object, help increase predictability.

It is important to highlight the main limitations of our study, which represent also directions for future work. 
First, we gathered data from a variety of online NFT marketplaces and not directly from the Ethereum or WAX 
blockchains, so that we have likely missed a number of “independent” NFT producers. Second, we mostly adopted 
an accepted categorisation for the NFTs, which includes a number of arbitrary decisions and could however be 
further refined (as every categorization). Third, since our primary goal was to provide a general overview of the 
market, we did not extensively explore all the available methods e.g., for the features extraction from  images33 and 
their clustering in a lower-dimensional  space34, machine learning for price  prediction35, or market  modelling36. 
We also did not consider collective attention as measured e.g. from social media or Wikipedia, which can be a 
further source of information about market  behaviour37–39. Fourth, we considered mostly the Ethereum and WAX 
blockchains, but several other platforms offer smart contracts and NFTs. Finally, our price prediction exercise did 
not include information about the creator of the (digital) object associated to the NFTs. While this is due mainly 
to the dataset, and in many cases the identity of the creator is not available or does not exist (e.g., for AI generated 
images), it is likely that in certain contexts, and specifically for art, this can be an important aspect to consider.
Overall, NFTs are a new tool that satisfies some of the needs of creators, users, and collectors of a large class 
of digital and non-digital objects. As such, they are probably here to stay or, at least, they represent a first step 
towards new tools to deal with property and provenance of such assets. We anticipate that our study will help 
accelerate new research on NFT in a broad array of disciplines, including economics, law, cultural evolution, art 
history, computational social science, and computer science. The results will also help practitioners make sense 
of a rapidly evolving landscape and inform the design of more efficient marketplaces as well as the associated 
regulation.
Data and methods
We summarize our data collection below and provide a detailed description of our data manipulations in “SI”.
Sales data collection. Our dataset includes only transactions representing purchases of NFTs, whose 
ownership change following that transaction. We exclude from our analysis any transactions representing the 
minting of NFTs or bids during an auction. We track different cryptocurrencies. Etherum blockchain data for 
the collections SuperRare, Makersplace, Knownorigin, Cryptopunks, and Asyncart were shared by NonFungi-
ble  Corporation24, a company that tracks historical NFT sales data to build NFT valuations. Other Ethereum 
blockchain data were downloaded from four open-source APIs: CryptoKitties  sales40, Gods-Unchained41, 
 Decentraland42, and  OpenSea43. With OpenSea that allows trading in multiple cryptocurrencies. We also moni-
tored the WAX blockchain, through tracking transactions in the Atomic  API44.
We group NFTs into six categories: Art consisting of digital artworks such as images, videos, or GIFs; Col-
lectible representing items of interest to collectors; Games including digital object used in competitive games; 
Metaverse consisting of pieces of virtual worlds; Utility representing items having a specific function; and Other 
including the remaining collections. More details on the NFT categorization are explained in “SI”. The final, 
Table 1.  Secondary sale price prediction. Linear regressions to predict the NFTs’ median secondary sale 
price one month after their primary sale from three families of features: centrality on the trader network (k, 
PR), history of sales in the NFT’s collection (namely prior probability of secondary sale presale and median 
sale price 1 week before the sale medianprice), and visual features ( visPCAi ). Regression models were fit to 
different categories of NFTs independently. For each category, the number of NFTs and collections it contains 
is reported. The R2
adj is a measure of goodness of fit, and it quantifies the proportion of the data variance 
explained by the model. The p-values of all β coefficients are < 0.01 except for those marked with • , which are 
all > 0.05.

cleaned dataset includes 935 million USD traded in 6.1 million transactions involving 4.7 million NFTs grouped 
in 4624 collections. Our dataset includes transactions in 160 different cryptocurrencies with most of them made 
in WAX (52% of the total number of transactions), while the volume in USD is mostly ETH (81% of the total 
volume). We show general statistics of the categories of NFTs considered, involving a total of 359,561 buyers, 
314,439 sellers, trading 4.7 millions NFTs involving 953 million USD in cryptocurrencies (see “SI”).
Image collection and visual feature extraction. For each NFT in our dataset (except for less than 3000 
exceptions) we managed to collect at least one URL that points to a copy of the NFT’s digital object. We focused 
only on objects with image file formats (e.g. PNG, SVG, JPEG) and GIFs, for a total of about 1.2 million unique 
graphical objects associated with 4.7 million unique NFTs. Note that a single digital object can be related to 
multiple NFTs; this happens for example for identical playing cards that are minted in multiple copies, each asso-
ciated with a different NFT. Since our algorithm for visual feature extraction works with static images, we con-
verted the animated GIFs to PNGs by extracting central frame of each GIF. In order to succinctly represent the 
visual features that characterize an image, we encode it into a latent space using a neural network. Specifically, 
we pick the  PyTorch45 implementation of  AlexNet46, a deep convolutional neural network architecture designed 
for image classification. We initialize AlexNet with weights pre-trained on  ImageNet47, a widely-used reference 
dataset of labeled images. Given an image in input, AlexNet passes it through multiple layers of transformation. 
The second to last layer (i.e., the layer before the classification layer) is a vector consisting of 4096 values that 
constitute a dense representation of the input image into a high-dimensional space. These vectors can be used for 
a variety of tasks such as similarity ranking, clustering, or classification. To reduce the dimensionality of AlexNet 
vectors, we extracted their principal components using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)48, and selected 
the five most relevant ones. PCA projects each point of the high-dimensional space into a space with a desired 
number of dimensions, while preserving the data variation as much as possible.
