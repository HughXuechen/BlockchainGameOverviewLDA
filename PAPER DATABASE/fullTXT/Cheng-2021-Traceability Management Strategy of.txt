Regulating and supervising the energy vehicle (EV) power battery recycling market, improving the utilization rate of EV power
battery recycling, and guaranteeing the safety and control of all aspects of recycling treatment require the establishment of an
effective traceability system. 'e decentralization and tamper-proof characteristics of the blockchain can ensure the safety and
reliability of relevant data while realizing traceability management. 'is study establishes the Stackelberg game model to compare
and analyze the effects of different government mechanisms on the profits of each subject before and after participating in power
battery traceability management. 'e study further uses the model to explore strategies to improve the enthusiasm of EV power
battery recycling subjects to participate in traceability management. 'e results show that (1) the participation of each recycling
subject in EV power battery blockchain traceability can help move more spent power batteries into formal recycling channels; (2)
the government should adopt appropriate mechanisms to promote its participation in EV power battery blockchain traceability,
the best result being when the government adopts a subsidy mechanism for consumers; and (3) the profit of the EV power battery
manufacturer is inversely proportional to the target recycling rate set by the government. Furthermore, the pursuit of a very high
target recycling rate is not conducive to the normal implementation of initial EV power battery blockchain traceability man-
agement. 'erefore, it is crucial for the government to set a reasonable target recycling rate.
1. Introduction
In recent years, China’s environmental pollution problem
has become increasingly serious, with frequent trans-
portation activities emitting large amounts of pollutants and
becoming a major source of environmental pollution and
energy consumption [1]. In 2010, the Chinese government
listed the “new energy” and “new energy vehicle (NEV)”
industries as national strategic emerging industry sectors to
accelerate the development of the renewable energy industry
and solve the environmental pollution and energy crises [2].
According to the data released by the China Association of
Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM), the production and
sale of the NEV in China reached 1.366 and 1.367 million
units, respectively, in 2020. Of these, 1.105 million and 1.115
million units of energy vehicles (EVs) were produced and
sold, with a yearly growth of 5.4% and 11.6%, respectively
[3]. 'e use of power batteries has increased considerably
following the continuous development of the EV industry.
'e 5 to 8 years of use of EV power batteries show that China
entered the peak of power battery end of life around 2020
[4]. 'e improper disposal of spent EV power batteries not
only increases the risk of environmental pollution but also
leads to the wastage of precious metal resources [5]. Today’s
deteriorating ecological environment and depleted natural
resources and EV power battery recycling-related enter-
prises and organizations proactively carry out the entire life
cycle supply chain management of power batteries to realize
the recycling and resource utilization of EV power batteries.
'ese can yield huge economic and ecological benefits [6, 7].
Companies obtain more value from the reverse logistics and
remanufacturing process of spent EV power batteries while
also protecting the ecological environment [8].
China began recycling spent EV power batteries later
than other developed countries; however, the development
status is not optimistic. Moreover, the recycling and

government regulatory systems need to be improved [9].
First, informal recycling channels coexist with formal
recycling channels. 'e recycling methods of informal
recycling channels are more convenient. 'erefore, a large
number of spent EV power batteries flow into informal
recycling channels. Furthermore, it is difficult for formal
recyclers to form large-scale benefits. Second, the synergy of
the subjects of production-recycling-echelon use is weak.
Moreover, there are data and technical barriers between
government departments and other enterprises. 'ese make
it more difficult to recycle and process spent EV power
batteries as well as supervise each recycling subject.
To regulate the recycling market order of spent EV
power batteries, the Ministry of Industry and Information
Technology (MIIT) issued the “Interim Regulations on the
Traceability Management of the Recycling and Utilization
of New Energy Vehicle Power Batteries.” 'is proposed the
requirements for the establishment of “the Integrated
Management Platform for the National Monitoring of New
Energy Vehicles and Traceability of Power Battery Recy-
cling,” hoping to realize the information collection and
supervision of the entire process of power battery pro-
duction, sales, use, end of life, recycling, and utilization
[10]. Furthermore, the traceability management of EV
power batteries in China entered the primary stage.
However, the existing EV power battery traceability system
cannot guarantee a high level of system reliability, data
accuracy, and information transparency. Moreover, some
EV power battery manufacturers and formal recyclers are
not very active in EV power battery traceability manage-
ment considering issues such as data privacy and security.
Additionally, China’s policies and regulations in this field
still need to be improved. 'ese result in the slow pro-
motion of China’s EV power battery traceability
management.
Blockchain technology is characterized by immutability
and distributed storage among other characteristics. 'e data
security problem of the power battery traceability system can
be solved using computer technologies such as point-to-point
transmission, consensus mechanism, and encryption algo-
rithm [11]. After the data are deposited into the blockchain to
obtain a consensus of the network nodes, it is difficult to be
tampered with, which ensures the authenticity and security of
the information related to the power battery [12]. Blockchain
can realize the transparency of the data of the entire process of
the EV power battery supply chain by using a consensus
mechanism, improving the knowledge of government de-
partments and related enterprises on the entire process of
power battery recycling and breaking the data barriers, so as
to further realize source traceability, process supervision, and
risk early warning. 'e government should simultaneously
adopt certain mechanisms to encourage EV power battery
recycling and treatment-related enterprises to join this
traceability management platform. 'erefore, this study aims
to explore strategies to improve the enthusiasm of EV power
battery recycling subjects to further participate in traceability
management by establishing the Stackelberg gamemodel.'e
game model is of great significance in promoting the high-
quality development of the power battery recycling industry.
'e potential contributions of the study include the
following:
(1) Based on summarizing the research of domestic and
foreign scholars in the field of EV power battery
recycling, the study innovatively proposed the ap-
plication of blockchain traceability management to
EV power battery recycling, hence filling the research
gaps in this research field.
(2) Considering different government guidance mech-
anisms, a comparative analysis of the influence of
government rewards, punishments, and subsidies on
the enthusiasm of power battery recycling subjects to
participate in traceability management is analyzed;
government departments and power battery recy-
cling and processing companies provide decision-
making references.
(3) 'e Stackelberg game model was established con-
sidering factors such as consumer willingness and
blockchain cost. An empirical analysis verified the
effectiveness of the model.
'e rest of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2
introduces the current research status. Section 3 describes
the model. Section 4 compares and analyzes the optimal
situation under different strategies. Section 5 uses relevant
data for empirical research. In conclusion, Section 6 sum-
marizes and discusses the limitations of this research.
2. Literature Review
Currently, research on recycling channels and EV power
battery recycling in the domestic and foreign literature
mainly involves the selection of recycling channels, pricing
decisions under multichannel competition, and the influ-
ence of government coordination mechanisms. Research on
blockchain traceability management mainly focuses on food
and medical care. Furthermore, research in the field of EV
power battery recycling is scarce.
Regarding research on recycling channels, Savaskan et al.
[13] compared and analyzed three recycling models with
manufacturers, distributors, and third-party recyclers as
recycling takers. 'ey found that the recycling model with
distributors as recycling takers was optimal, all else being
equal. Liu et al. [14] analyzed the impact of government
subsidies on formal and informal recycling channels while
considering the quality of the recycled products. 'ey found
that the marginal effect of government subsidies was in-
significant when the quality of the recycled products was
high. Li et al. [15] developed a Stackelberg game model with
dual recycling channels while considering consumer pref-
erences. 'ey concluded that the improvement of envi-
ronmental benefits under government governance
mechanisms depends on subsidies and consumer channel
preferences. Tang et al. [16] used social welfare as an in-
dicator for selecting recycling models and built Stackelberg
game models under three single-recycling channel models
and three competitive dual-recycling channel models based
on the government’s reward and penalty mechanism. 'ey
2 Scientific Programming
found that setting a reasonable minimum power battery
recycling rate as a benchmark for the reward and penalty
mechanism is crucial. Xia et al. [9] studied the impact of
competition between mixed WEEE sales channels and
recycling channels on CLSC decisions under the govern-
ment mechanism. 'ey found the optimal strategy of each
company and government based on the Stackelberg game
model.
Regarding research on power battery recycling, owing to
the increasing depletion of natural resources, the recycling of
products and materials is a growing concern [17]. Research
in this field can be categorized into two types: qualitative and
quantitative. Regarding the qualitative aspects of power
battery research, Wang andWu [18] analyzed the challenges
in the recycling process of LiFePO4 batteries in China and
proposed improvement strategies to make the recycling
chain more environmentally friendly. Zeng et al. [5] ana-
lyzed the potential environmental and safety risks in the
recycling and disposal processes of used lithium batteries
and proposed a comprehensive management scheme re-
garding policies and regulations, recycling systems, and
recycling technology. Beaudet et al. [19] analyzed the main
challenges and opportunities for recycling new energy ve-
hicle batteries and made relevant recommendations to ad-
dress these challenges. Hao et al. [20] combined the current
status of reverse logistics of power battery recycling and
proposed effective countermeasures to contribute to the
development of reverse logistics of power battery recycling.
Regarding the quantitative aspects of power batteries, Li
et al. [21] studied the coordination strategies of each supply
chain subject in a three-tier reverse supply chain consisting
of recyclers, remanufacturers, and retailers and conducted a
detailed comparative analysis of the optimal decisions under
different strategies. Gu et al. [22] studied the optimal pricing
strategy for the closed-loop supply chain of power batteries
and found that recycling spent power batteries does not
benefit the profits of power battery manufacturers. 'ey
further suggested some government incentives to improve
the economic benefits of recycling. Tang et al. [23] explored
the social, economic, and environmental impacts of recy-
cling end-of-life electric vehicle batteries under government
subsidies and reward and punishment mechanisms, re-
spectively. Hao et al. [17] established an improved fuzzy
neural network evaluation structure model based on the
combination of the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method
and particle swarm algorithm- (PSO-) optimized error
backpropagation (BP) neural network with the feasibility of
reverse logistics of end-of-life automotive power batteries as
the target layer. Wang et al. [24] considered the recycling
and remanufacturing costs of waste batteries and carbon tax
to establish the lowest total cost mixed-integer programming
problem model for the recycling network of NEVs. Wang
et al. [25] analyzed the impact of multiattribute decision-
making (MADM) on the efficiency of the end-of-life vehicle
(ELV) reverse logistics industry in the context of a circular
economy, hence indirectly providing a basis for manage-
ment and investment decisions in the new energy vehicle
power battery recycling industry. It is beneficial to explore
the recycling of waste to promote the construction of
ecological civilization against the background of a com-
prehensive implementation of the “Healthy China” strategy
[26].
Research in blockchain traceability management focuses
on food and medical care. Dandage et al. [27] analyzed the
necessity of traceability management in the food industry
and introduced the relevant technologies used with the help
of traceability management. Tsang et al. [28] and Lin et al.
[29] addressed the problems of opaque information, easy
tampering, centralization, and serious information silos in
traditional food traceability systems. Caro et al. [30] and
Feng et al. [31] proposed a food safety traceability system
based on the blockchain and Internet of 'ings (IoT) based
on the analysis of the problems of traditional agricultural
product supply chain traceability systems. Gong et al. [32]
built a blockchain-based power battery data sharing system
for real-time data monitoring and the sharing of the power
battery life cycle. Gopalakrishnan et al. [33] proposed a
blockchain-based solid waste management (SWM) model to
solve the problem of waste traceability. Furthermore, the
SWM system with the cost element of the blockchain was
optimized.
'rough the aforementioned combination of the do-
mestic and foreign research literature, it is evident that
various research scholars have studied the selection of
recycling channels and EV power battery recycling from
different perspectives; however, research on EV power
battery traceability management in the context of blockchain
is relatively rare. Based on the lack of research in this area,
this study examines the blockchain-based EV power battery
traceability management strategy and analyzes the influence
of different government mechanisms on the unit recycling
price, quantity, and profit of each subject. We hope to fill the
research gap in this field and provide a relevant basis for the
formulation of relevant policies and regulations as well as a
reference for the decision-making of EV power battery
recycling-related enterprises.
3. Model Description and Construction
3.1. Problem Description. Data barriers and technical bar-
riers exist between EV power battery recycling subjects and
government enterprises, which make it more difficult for
enterprises to recycle spent EV power batteries and for the
government to supervise each recycling subject. 'e Min-
istry of Industry and Information Technology requires the
establishment of a power battery traceability platform, so as
to realize the information collection of the whole process of
power battery production, use, end of life, recycling, and
utilization. It can also realize the implementation of the
monitoring of the responsibility of each link subject to fulfill
the recycling. However, the existing EV power battery
traceability system for energy vehicles cannot guarantee a
high level of system reliability and data security, enterprises
are not highly motivated to participate in power battery
traceability management, and China’s policies and regula-
tions in this field still need to be improved, resulting in the
slow promotion of EV power battery traceability manage-
ment in China. Blockchain technology is characterized by
Scientific Programming 3
immutability and distributed storage among other charac-
teristics. 'e data security problem of the power battery
traceability system can be solved using computer technol-
ogies such as point-to-point transmission, consensus
mechanism, and encryption algorithm. EV power battery
manufacturer can provide technical support to the formal
recycler through the traceability management platform to
improve the rate of echelon use. And the government can
supervise the EV power battery recyclingmarket through the
EV power battery traceability management platform and
adjust the relevant mechanism, as shown in Figure 1.
In the context of EV power battery traceability man-
agement by blockchain technology, this study constructs a
reverse supply chain comprising an EV power battery
manufacturer, a power battery formal recycler, a power
battery informal recycler, and consumers. Figure 2 shows the
specific structure. 'ree government mechanisms are con-
sidered in this paper to promote the participation of each
recycling subject in power battery traceability management:
a reward and punishment mechanism for EV power battery
manufacturers (situation B); a subsidy mechanism for for-
mal recyclers (situation C); and a subsidy mechanism for
consumers (situation D). EV power battery manufacturers
have two channels to choose from: formal recycling channels
and informal recycling channels. Informal recycler adopts
door-to-door recycling, and formal recycler adopts the
method of allowing consumers to send spent EV power
batteries to stores or formal recycling stations in the com-
munity. 'is study assumes that prc >ptc because the rel-
atively inconvenient recycling channels need to attract
consumers to participate in recycling by increasing the
recycling price [9]. 'e personnel involved in the recycling
process inspect, classify, and discharge the batteries
according to the information provided by the EV power
battery manufacturer and the status of the actual batteries.
'e recycled batteries are prioritized for echelon use. Fur-
thermore, materials are extracted from them for remanu-
facturing batteries that are not available for echelon use.

3.2. Model Assumptions and Parameters’ Description. We
have made some assumptions about this article based on the
research of related scholars:
(1) For simplification, we assume that the recycling
market comprises an EV power battery manufac-
turer, a formal recycler, and an informal recycler
[34].
(2) 'is study only considers the power batteries sold
with EVs. Moreover, all the EV power batteries sold
can be recycled. 'erefore, the total supply of the EV
power battery recycling market is the total supply of
the EV sales market Q.
(3) A recycled EV power battery is a single type [22].
(4) 'e EV power battery traceability management
platform established based on the blockchain al-
lows only government-certified enterprises with
recycling and processing qualifications to partic-
ipate. 'is study classifies such enterprises as
formal recyclers. 'e government cannot regulate
the market transactions between the power battery
manufacturer and informal recycler. 'erefore, the
recycling rate θ calculated from the government’s
perspective is the ratio of the recycling quantity qrc
from formal recycling channels to the total supply
quantity Q.
(5) 'e recycling volume under each recycling channel
is affected by the recycling price. 'e recycling
function of the informal recycler is
qtc � q + αptc − βprc, while that of the formal recy-
cler is qrc � αprc − βptc, where α> β> 0.
(6) 'e residual value of the recycled EV power battery is
not 0; that is, A+B> 0. To ensure the profit of each
subject, let pmr >prc and pmt >ptc.
(7) EV power battery manufacturer as the producer
bears themain responsibility of recycling, consumers
are the source of recycling, and formal recyclers are
the main recycling enterprises. 'erefore, the initial
stage can be assumed that Sc > Sr > Sm. 'e above
rewards and penalties and subsidies can be adjusted
later according to the actual situation.
(8) EV power battery manufacturer acts as the leader of
Stackelberg, and the recycler modifies the strategy to
be adopted according to the EV power battery
manufacturer.
'e symbols are described in the text as shown in Table 1.
3.3. Stackelberg Game Model
3.3.1. Mode A: Nonparticipation in Blockchain Traceability
Management. In the process of EV power battery recycling,
EV power battery manufacturer sets the transfer price of EV
power batteries according to the market supply and demand
situation firstly; then, the EV power battery formal recycler
and informal recycler set the recycling recovery price
according to the transfer price; finally, consumers pursue
utility maximization and choose the recycling channel

according to the recycling price and convenience of recy-
cling given by each recycler. 'erefore, in the case of no
government mechanism intervention (situation A), the
profit functions of the EV power battery manufacturer,
formal recycler, and informal recycler can be expressed,
respectively, as follows.
'e profit function of the EV power battery manufac-
turer can be expressed as

(1)
'e EV power battery manufacturer needs to pay the
cost of transfer pmr or pmt to the recycler and make profits
from the batteries by echelon use A or extracting metal
materials B.
'e profit function of the formal recycler can be
expressed as

'e profit function of the informal recycler can be
expressed as

'e profit of recyclers is the revenue received from the
EV power battery manufacturer pmr or pmt minus the cost of
recycling prc or ptc.

3.3.2. Mode B: Participate in Blockchain Traceability Man-
agement—Adopt a Reward and Punishment Mechanism for
the Manufacturer. Spent EV power batteries need to go
through steps such as dismantling and testing before being
used in the echelon, and informal recyclers face many
technical difficulties in processing. 'rough the blockchain
traceability management platform, formal recycler can ob-
tain the status information of EV power batteries and
technical support provided by the battery manufacturer,
which can improve the gradient utilization rate to a certain
extent. 'e increased gradient echelon use rate is expressed
in terms of k; the utilization rate is (k + θr). Meanwhile,
when participating in EV power battery blockchain trace-
ability management, EV power battery manufacturer and
formal recycler need to pay management costs I, including
network costs and labor costs. 'erefore, in the situation of
the government adopts a reward and punishment mecha-
nism for the EV power battery manufacturer participating in
blockchain traceability management (situation B), the profit
functions of the EV power battery manufacturer, formal
recycler, and informal recycler can be expressed, respec-
tively, as follows.

turer can be expressed as

'rough the blockchain traceability management plat-
form, the government can regulate the EV power battery
manufacturer and formal recycler. In situation B, the gov-
ernment gives rewards to the EV power battery manufac-
turer when the actual recycling quantity is greater than the
target recycling quantity; on the contrary, the government
gives punishments to power battery manufacturers when the
actual recycling quantity is less than the target recycling
quantity.

3.3.3. Mode C: Participate in Blockchain Traceability Man-
agement—Adopt a Subsidy Mechanism for the Formal
Recycler. As situation B, the echelon use rate can be im-
proved when the EV power battery manufacturer and formal
recycler participate in blockchain traceability management,
while they need to pay a certain management cost I.
'erefore, in the situation of the government adopts a
subsidy mechanism for formal recyclers who participate in
blockchain traceability management (situation C), the profit
functions of the EV power battery manufacturer, formal
recycler, and informal recycler can be expressed, respec-
tively, as follows.

3.3.4. Mode D: Participate in Blockchain Traceability Man-
agement—Adopt a Subsidy Mechanism for Consumers.
As situation B, the echelon use rate can be improved when
the EV power battery manufacturer and formal recycler
participate in blockchain traceability management, while
they need to pay a certain management cost I. 'erefore, in
the situation of the government adopts a subsidy mechanism
for consumers who hand over spent EV power batteries to
the formal recycler (situation D), the profit functions of the
power battery manufacturer, formal recycler, and informal
recycler can be expressed as follows, respectively.
'e profit function of the EV power battery manufac-
turer can be expressed as
ΠD
m � A k + θr( 􏼁 + B 1 − θr − k( 􏼁 − pmr􏼂 􏼃 α prc + Sc( 􏼁 − βptc􏼂 􏼃

(12)
'e profit function of the formal recycler can be
expressed as
ΠD
r＝ pmr − prc − cr + Sr( 􏼁 α prc + Sc( 􏼁 − βptc􏼂 􏼃 − I.
(13)
In situation D, the government gives subsidies to con-
sumers through formal recyclers.
'e profit function of the informal recycler can be
expressed as
ΠD
t ＝ pmt − ptc − ct( 􏼁 q + αptc − βprc( 􏼁. (14)

Proposition 3 illustrates that the transfer price paid by
the EV power battery manufacturer to the informal recycler
is unaffected regardless of whether the EV power battery
manufacturer and formal recycler participate in blockchain

Proposition 4 illustrates that, after the EV power battery
manufacturer and formal recycler participate in blockchain
traceability, when (A − B)k + 2cr > Sc, the transfer price paid
by the EV power battery manufacturer to the formal recycler
is greater than the transfer price when they do not participate
in blockchain traceability management, and it is greatest
when incentives and penalties are adopted for the EV power
battery manufacturer. 'is is because an increase in the
transfer price by the EV power battery manufacturer can
help the formal recycler to recycle EV power batteries, hence
recycling more EV power batteries, avoiding penalties, and
obtaining more government subsidies. When
(A − B)k + 2cr < Sc, the government pays more subsidies to
consumers through the formal recycler. 'e formal recycler
has a stronger competitive advantage in recycling prices and
can recycle more EV power batteries, at which time the EV
power battery manufacturer will appropriately reduce the
transfer price paid to the formal recycler. □

Proposition 5 illustrates that, after the EV power battery
manufacturer and formal recycler participate in blockchain
traceability, when ((A − B)kα2/3α2 − β2)< Sc, the recycling
price paid by the formal recycler to consumers is greater
than that when they do not participate in blockchain
traceability management. 'e recycling price is greatest
when the subsidy mechanism is adopted for the formal
recycler. 'is is because the increase in the recycling price by
the formal recycler will increase the competitive advantage,
which can help consumers to deliver spent EV power bat-
teries to the formal recycler and consequently receive more
government subsidies. When ((A − B)kα2/3α2 − β2)< Sc,
the government pays more subsidies to consumers through
the formal recycler. 'e formal recycler has a stronger
competitive advantage in recycling price in this case.
'erefore, the formal recycler can also recycle EV power
batteries by appropriately reducing the recycling price paid
to consumers. □

'e recycling price paid to consumers is greatest when a
subsidy mechanism is adopted by consumers. At this time,
the formal recycler has a stronger competitive advantage.
'erefore, the informal recycler must increase the recycling
price to be more competitive and further obtain more EV
power batteries. □

Proposition 7 illustrates that, after the EV power battery
manufacturer and formal recycler participate in blockchain
traceability, the formal recycler obtains more EV power
batteries than when they do not participate in blockchain
traceability management, while the informal recycler does
the opposite. Furthermore, the formal recycler obtains the
most EV power batteries, and the informal recycler obtains
the least EV power batteries when the subsidy mechanism is
adopted for consumers. 'erefore, the participation of the
EV power battery manufacturer and formal recycler in
blockchain traceability helps promote the flow of retired EV
power batteries to the formal recycling market and reduces
black market transactions. 'e results are optimal when the
government adopts the subsidy mechanism for consumers.
Considering that the profit of each recycling subject is
complex, it cannot be analyzed directly using the method of
analyzing profit expressions. 'erefore, it is compared after
solving in the arithmetic part. □

assumed to be 111,509. According to [16, 22, 23, 33], we
obtained the relevant data of the EV power battery recycling

'e profit of the EV power battery manufacturer after
participating in blockchain traceability management is
smaller when the government adopts the reward and
punishment mechanism for the manufacturer than when
they do not participate in blockchain traceability manage-
ment. 'e profit is, however, larger when the government
adopts the subsidy mechanism for consumers and the
subsidy mechanism for the formal recycler than when they
do not participate in blockchain traceability management.
'e profit is the largest when the government adopts the

'e profit of the formal recycler after participating in
blockchain traceability management is smaller when the
government adopts the subsidy mechanism for the formal
recycler than when they do not participate in blockchain
traceability management. 'e profit is, however, larger when
the government adopts the subsidymechanism for consumers
and the reward and punishmentmechanism for the EV power
battery manufacturer than when they do not participate in
blockchain traceability management. It is the largest when the
government adopts the subsidy mechanism for consumers.
'e profit of the informal recycler after each recycling
subject participates in blockchain traceability management is
smaller than when they do not participate in blockchain
traceability management.'e profit of the informal recycler is
smaller than when they do not participate in blockchain
traceability management; it is the smallest when the gov-
ernment adopts a subsidy mechanism for consumers.
In summary, it is evident that when the government
adopts a subsidy mechanism for consumers, the EV power
battery manufacturer and formal recycler realize the largest
profits, while the informal recycler realizes the smallest
profit. 'is promotes the participation of the EV power
battery manufacturer and formal recycler in EV power
battery blockchain traceability management.
5.2. Sensitivity Analysis. When the subsidy mechanism is
adopted for the formal recycler and the subsidy mechanism
is adopted for consumers, the expressions of the relationship

centive and punishment mechanism is adopted for the EV
power battery manufacturer, the subsidy mechanism is
adopted for formal recyclers, and the subsidy mechanism is
adopted for consumers (see Appendix). 'erefore, the im-
ages reflected in Figure 5 overlap.
Figures 3–5 show that, after each recycling subject joins
the blockchain traceability management, when the reward
and punishment mechanism is adopted for EV power
battery manufacturers, the profits of the EV power battery
manufacturer and formal recycler are positively propor-
tional to the amount of reward and punishment. 'e profit
of the informal recycler, however, is inversely proportional
to the amount of reward and punishment. When the subsidy
mechanism is adopted for the formal recycler, the profit of
the EV power battery manufacturer is positively propor-
tional to the amount of subsidy, and the profits of formal and
informal recyclers are inversely proportional to the amount
of subsidy. When the subsidy mechanism is adopted for
consumers, the profits of the EV power battery manufacturer
and formal recycler are proportional to the amount of re-
wards and penalties. Moreover, the profit of the informal
recycler is inversely proportional to the amount of rewards
and penalties.
In summary, when the subsidymechanism is adopted for
formal recyclers, increasing the subsidy amount reduces the
profits of formal recyclers, which does not promote the
participation of the formal recycler in blockchain traceability
management and affects the normal implementation of EV
power battery traceability management. However, increas-
ing the amount of rewards and punishments for the EV
power battery manufacturer and the amount of subsidies for
consumers helps to increase the profits of the EV power
battery manufacturer and formal recycler, suppressing the
informal recycler and consequently reducing black market
transactions and promoting the participation of each
recycling subject in EV power battery blockchain traceability
management; the results are optimal when consumers adopt
the subsidy mechanism.
Figure 6 shows that, after each recycling subject joins
blockchain traceability management, the profit of the EV
power battery manufacturer is inversely proportional to the
target recycling rate set by the government when the gov-
ernment adopts a reward and punishment mechanism for
the EV power battery manufacturer. However, when the

profit of the EV power battery manufacturer after partici-
pating in blockchain traceability management is smaller
than that when they do not participate in blockchain
traceability management. Moreover, the profit of the EV
power battery manufacturer is negative when ξ0 ≥ 0.212.
'is is because the power battery manufacturer can only
receive subsidies if their actual recycling rate is higher than
the target recycling rate set by the government; otherwise,
they will be penalized. 'erefore, when the government
adopts the reward and punishment mechanism for the EV
power battery manufacturer, it should not pursue an ex-
cessively high target recycling rate at the primary stage. 'e
government should set an appropriate target recycling rate
to promote the participation of the EV power battery
manufacturer in the blockchain traceability management
and therefore ensure the normal implementation of the
traceability management of EV power batteries. After the EV
power battery manufacturer participates in blockchain
traceability management, the government can adjust the
target recycling rate according to the actual situation.
Figure 7 shows that the profit of EV power battery
manufacturers is proportional to the increase factor of the
echelon use rate. 'erefore, EV power battery manufac-
turers can improve the echelon use rate by providing
relevant technical support to EV power battery recyclers to
increase the profit. When the increase factor of the echelon
use rate is certain, the profit of the EV power battery
manufacturer is the largest when the government adopts
the subsidy mechanism for consumers, followed by the
subsidy mechanism for the formal recycler. When the
increase factor of the echelon use rate k≤ 0.385, the profit
of EV power battery manufacturers when the reward and
punishment mechanism is adopted is smaller than the
profit when they do not participate in blockchain trace-
ability management; when k≤ 0.108, the profit of EV
power battery manufacturers is negative. 'erefore, the
enthusiasm of the manufacturer to participate in block-
chain traceability management is smaller, which is not
conducive to the normal implementation of EV power
battery traceability management.
Figure 8 shows that the profit of formal recyclers is
proportional to the increase in the echelon use rate;
therefore, the formal recycler can improve the echelon use
rate by improving the recycling processing technology,
hence increasing the profit. When the increase factor of the
echelon use rate is certain, the profit of the formal recycler
is the largest when the government adopts the subsidy
mechanism for consumers, followed by the incentive and
punishment mechanism for the EV power battery manu-
facturer. When the subsidy mechanism is adopted for the
formal recycler, the profits of the formal recycler are
smaller than those when they do not participate in
blockchain traceability management when the echelon use

to the normal implementation of EV power battery

Figure 9 shows that the profit of the informal recycler is
inversely proportional to the echelon use increase factor, and
the profit of the informal recycler is smaller than the profit
realized when they do not participate in blockchain trace-
ability management after each recycling subject participates
in blockchain traceability management. When the echelon
use rate increases by a certain factor, the profit of the in-
formal recycler is the smallest when the government adopts a
subsidy mechanism for consumers, followed by the profit
when the subsidy mechanism is adopted for the formal
recycler. 'erefore, it can be proved that the government’s
adoption of mechanisms to promote the participation of
each recycler in blockchain traceability management can
play a role in suppressing informal recyclers, hence reducing
black market transactions and promoting the transforma-
tion of the informal recycler.
6. Conclusions
To explore the strategies to improve the enthusiasm of EV
power battery recycling subjects to participate in traceability
management, this study considers factors such as the echelon
use rate, government mechanism, and blockchain cost and
constructs a Stackelberg game model comprising the power
battery manufacturer, formal recycler, and informal recycler.
Based on this model, the changes in the unit recycling price,
recycling quantity, and profit of each recycling subject under
different government mechanisms before and after each
recycling subject participates in power battery traceability
management are compared and analyzed.'emain findings of
this study are as follows:
(1) 'e participation of each recycling subject in EV
power battery blockchain traceability helps improve
the competitive advantage of formal recyclers,
suppress informal recyclers, promote more retired
power batteries into formal recycling channels and
markets, and further reduce black market transac-
tions. Additionally, the adoption of appropriate
mechanisms by the government promotes the par-
ticipation of each recycling subject of EV power
batteries in blockchain traceability management,
with the best result when the government adopts a
subsidy mechanism for consumers.
(2) After each recycling subject participates in block-
chain traceability management, the profits of the
formal recycler and EV power battery manufacturer
when the government adopts the reward and pun-
ishment mechanism for EV power battery manu-
facturers are positively proportional to the amount of
government rewards and punishments, and the
profits of the informal recycler are inversely pro-
portional to the amount of government rewards and
punishments. 'erefore, the government increases
the amount of rewards and punishments, which
promotes the participation of each recycling subject
in blockchain traceability management. 'erefore,
when the government adopts the reward and pun-
ishment mechanism for the EV power battery
manufacturer, it should not pursue an excessively
high target recycling rate at the primary stage. 'e
government should set an appropriate target recy-
cling rate to promote the participation of the EV
power battery manufacturer in blockchain trace-
ability management and consequently ensure the
normal implementation of the traceability man-
agement of EV power batteries.
(3) After each recycling subject participates in block-
chain traceability management, the profits of the
formal recycler and EV power battery manufacturer
when the government adopts the reward and pun-
ishment mechanism for formal recyclers are posi-
tively proportional to the amount of government
subsidies, and the profits of the informal recycler are
inversely proportional to the amount of government
rewards and punishments. 'e profits of the formal
recycler after participating in blockchain traceability
management are smaller than the profits realized
when they do not participate in blockchain trace-
ability management. 'is does not promote the
participation of formal recyclers in blockchain
traceability management of EV power batteries and
cannot ensure the normal implementation of
traceability management of EV power batteries.
(4) 'e profits of power battery manufacturers and
formal recyclers are positively proportional to the
increase in the echelon use rate. Furthermore, the
profits of informal recyclers are inversely propor-
tional to the increase factor of the echelon use rate;
therefore, the results are optimal when the subsidy
mechanism is adopted for consumers. However,
when the increase factor of the echelon use rate is

small, the profit after adopting the reward and
punishment mechanism for EV power battery
manufacturers or adopting a subsidy mechanism for
formal recyclers is smaller than the profit realized
when participating in blockchain traceability man-
agement. 'erefore, the government should adopt a
mechanism to encourage EV power battery manu-
facturers to provide relevant technical support to EV
power battery recyclers to improve the echelon use
rate, so as to consequently increase the profit of each
recycling subject and promote the participation of
each recycling subject in EV power battery block-
chain traceability.
In summary, in the initial stage of blockchain traceability
management of EV power batteries, the government should
play a leading role in establishing an institutional system that
promotes the participation of various recycling subjects in
the blockchain traceability management of EV power bat-
teries. Additionally, it should set a reasonable target recy-
cling rate and the amount of rewards and penalties, which
can be adjusted according to the actual situation at a later
stage. Simultaneously, formal recycling enterprises should
be encouraged to adopt various ways to provide convenient
recycling services for EV consumers, so as to prompt
consumers to hand over EV power batteries to formal
recycling enterprises. Under the guarantee of the govern-
ment mechanism, the EV power battery recycling enter-
prises should actively participate in the EV power battery
blockchain traceability management work to truly realize
that the source of the EV power battery and the destination
can be traced and consequently ensure that the spent EV
power battery can be safely and environmentally friendly
recycled and disposed and reused. Additionally, battery
manufacturing enterprises should strengthen cooperation
with formal recycling and processing enterprises, improve
the echelon use rate of the spent EV power battery gradient,
achieve safe recycling and environmental protection treat-
ment, and continuously improve the EV power battery
recycling industry chain.
'is study has several limitations. First, for the sake of
simple calculation, the EV power battery is regarded as a
single type. Second, the study does not consider government
and environmental benefits. Finally, the competition be-
tween multiple formal and informal recyclers is not con-
sidered. 'erefore, in future research, we will consider more
influencing factors and participants.
