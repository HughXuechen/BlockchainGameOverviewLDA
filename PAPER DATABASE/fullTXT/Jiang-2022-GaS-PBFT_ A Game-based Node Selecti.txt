Abstract—Future communication systems are trending to em-
brace an open and collaborative ecology for a rising number
of edge services and applications, enabling the evolutions of
multiple wireless ecosystems such as the Internet of things (IoT).
The collaborations among multi-party IoT users, devices, and
infrastructure require further designs in terms of security, trust,
and efficiency. Blockchain is considered a promising solution
to facilitate trusted multi-party collaborations, enhance security,
and protect privacy in the IoT. However, the research on IoT-
friendly blockchains is still facing a number of challenges due to
the heterogeneity and limited capabilities of IoT devices. In this
paper, we propose a hierarchical blockchain consensus combining
practical Byzantine fault tolerance and a game-based node
selection mechanism (GaS-PBFT). GaS-PBFT enables a logical
two-layer consensus network structure, groups heterogeneous
IoT participants into multiple collaborating consensus groups,
and imposes an efficient and fair game on each group for
selecting block generators of the IoT blockchains. Finally, we
conduct comprehensive simulations to show the performance of
the proposed GaS-PBFT consensus in terms of consensus latency,
transaction speed, node capacity, and security.

I. INTRODUCTION
Research on the beyond fifth-generation (B5G) and the
sixth-generation (6G) communication systems is gaining steam
recently [1]–[4]. Future communication systems are envi-
sioned to provide global coverage, support full applications
and ensure strong security, especially at the network edge
[5], [6]. Researchers have also envisioned an evolution of
the Internet of things (IoT) that could bring a more open,
efficient, collaborative, and secure industrial ecology for ubiq-
uitous wireless services and applications [7]. An increasing
number of studies have been searching for implementations
with emerging technologies such as blockchain. Blockchain
is an immutable distributed ledger technology proposed with
Bitcoin [8]. It admits a number of traits such as openness,
transparency, tamper-proof, multi-maintenance, etc., making it
a promising security solution and trusted collaboration enabler
for the industry [9].
As the core mechanism of blockchain, the consensus mech-
anism guarantees data consistency among multiple blockchain
participants [10]. A number of schemes [11]–[14] have been
proposed to integrate blockchains with the IoT, aiming to

facilitate cross-network collaborations, enhance the security of
IoT devices and protect device privacy. Some studies classified
heterogeneous IoT devices into multiple task groups. Devices
with abundant resources maintain the blockchain consensus,
while others help disseminate or verify blockchain messages
[11], [12]. Moreover, some works also took reputation or credit
evaluation into consideration by modifying the classic proof of
work to endow those high-rated nodes with more opportunities
to generate new blocks [13], [14].
However, designing an IoT-friendly blockchain consensus
is still facing a number of challenges. For one thing, the
IoT networks are usually regionally governed and have an
increasing demand for cross-region sharing and collaboration.
Most existing works focused on the conceptual integration
of blockchain consensus and the IoT but overlooked these
impending needs. For another, many studies, though consid-
ering the limitations in the IoT and adopting the BFT-based
blockchain consensus, are still far from practical applications.
For example, the communication overhead in most BFT-based
consensus grows quadratically with the number of participants,
which would quickly consume and saturate the capabilities of
those resource-constraint IoT devices.
In this paper, we incorporate the practical Byzantine fault
tolerance (PBFT) [15] consensus and a node selection game
to solve the challenges. The contributions of our work can
be concluded as follows. 1) We design a two layered IoT
consensus network with the PBFT consensus in the upper-
layer and a game-based node selection (GaS) consensus in
the lower-layer. In the lower-layer, we set up a consensus
group scheme to virtually group massive IoT participants
into multiple subnetworks where leader nodes are elected to
execute the upper-layer consensus. By this means, we connect
the PBFT and the GaS and form the GaS-PBFT consensus
mechanism. 2) We design the IoT-friendly, energy-efficient
GaS consensus mechanism with a four-stage block epoch
scheme and a game for selecting lower-layer leaders. The GaS
runs parallel to the upper-layer PBFT and the node selection
game is organized every block epoch to maintain the decentral-
ization and democracy of the consensus. 3) We demonstrate
the performance of our proposed consensus mechanism via
extensive simulations of the consensus latency, transaction
speed, node capacity, and security.
We organize the rest of this article as follows. Section
II briefly describes our hierarchical IoT consensus network.

Section III presents the detailed designs of the two-layer
consensus along with our game-based node selection mech-
anism. Section IV conducts several numerical experiments on
the proposed GaS-PBFT consensus, followed by concluding
remarks of Section V.
II. HIERARCHICAL IOT CONSENSUS NETWORK
The proposed two-layer IoT consensus network is shown in
Fig.1. The network is composed of several consensus groups
of nodes and each group represents a subnetwork of a number
of heterogeneous IoT devices. Every group has a major node,
and the major nodes form the upper-layer consensus network.
Different from Nakamoto-type consensus mechanisms, the
major node selection is driven by an efficient game-based node
selection (GaS) consensus mechanism (that we will introduce
in Section III) rather than energy-wasting mining or time-
consuming voting. Thus, both the upper-layer and lower-layer
consensus mechanisms are maintained by only a minority
of IoT participants, and communication resources during the
consensus can be saved.
In our proposed network, the upper-layer runs the main
PBFT consensus that maintains the blockchain. It involves a
group of major nodes that are chosen from groups in the lower-
layer via the GaS consensus. The chosen major nodes are
responsible for packing transactions, maintaining the upper-
layer consensus, and ensuring controllable latency and reliable
security.
The two-layer consensus network is devised to balance
network workload, shorten consensus latency and improve
transaction efficiency. Specifically, it embraces the following
features.
• Low consensus latency: Due to the design of consensus
groups in our network, the upper-layer PBFT consensus
does not need all nodes’ participation. Therefore, the
communication delay and bandwidth overhead can be
significantly reduced.
• Large network capacity: Although the computation and
communication complexity of the PBFT grows quadrat-
ically with the number of participating nodes in our
network, new network participants are first assigned to the
lower-layer and thus would not degrade the performance
of the upper-layer PBFT consensus.
• High transaction speed: The major node of each subnet-
work is responsible for packing the transactions generated
in its belonging subnetwork and executing the consensus
mechanism in the upper-layer. Since all the transaction
validations are done by major nodes, the fixed number of
consensus participants and message routing can lead to
more efficient message propagation and lift the achievable
transaction speed.
• Flexible and scalable network: Based on our design,
the network can be flexibly configured to cover more
geographic areas and accommodate more heterogeneous
devices without costing extensive computation, storage,
and communication resources.
III. GAME-BASED NODE SELECTION (GAS) CONSENSUS
A. GaS Consensus Overview
We design the GaS consensus to decide major nodes in
lower-layer networks via a game-based mechanism. Major
nodes selected by the GaS consensus will participate in the
upper-layer network as PBFT consensus maintainers. The
selection is conducted every block epoch in each consensus
group to preserve decentralization and democracy among
network participants. Specifically, in the lower-layer network,
we set up multiple consensus groups that are formed by a
number of IoT devices. A block epoch refers to a contiguous
sequence of blocks, during which each participating consensus
group elects a new leader, i.e., major node, according to the

game-based selection mechanism introduced in Section III-B.1
B. Game-based Selection Mechanism and Block Epoch Design
We introduce a fair game, namely "guess 2/3 of the aver-
age", to form the game-based selection mechanism.2 Nodes
participate in the GaS consensus by uploading a number
between 0 and 100 and wait for the winner to be announced.
The winner is the node that uploads a number closest to 2/3
of the average of all the valid uploaded numbers.
However, it is challenging to apply this game with the
blockchain. It is possible for blockchain users to track others’
uploaded numbers and create an unfair campaign. Therefore,
we design a four-stage block epoch to counter this issue, as
shown in Fig. 2. A block epoch E consists of T consecutive
blocks and is divided into four stages: 1) number uploading
stage (block 1 to Es1), 2) number revealing stage (block Es1
to Es2), 3) number calculating stage (block Es2 to Es3),
4) epoch switching stage (block Es3 to ET ). The following
steps describe the workflow of an epoch, but notice that
the first block in the blockchain, i.e., genesis block, is not
subject to these steps and is created along with the blockchain
initialization.
1) Number uploading stage: A node n decides a number
to upload. It chooses a number a and computes the hash
value of a with the hash value of the previous block
bprev as:
Hashn(a, bprev).
1Note that the blocks are generated by the upper-layer PBFT consensus,
and the block epoch used in the GaS consensus is to ensure a steady periodical
alternation of the group of blockchain maintainers.
2"Guess 2/3 of the average" is a multiplayer game in which all participants
first give a number from 0 to 100, and the one who gives the number closest
to 2/3 of the average of all the given numbers will win the game and receive
a prize. In this game, there is no sure-win strategy due to an existing Nash
equilibrium point of 0 [16].
Afterward, node n signs this hash value using its private
key to form a transaction Tx which is then sent to the
blockchain network.
2) Number revealing stage: Node n reveals its uploaded
number by broadcasting it to the blockchain network.
3) Number calculating stage: Participants wait for the
result. As for the major node of the consensus group,
it needs to verify the validity of the data in the above
two stages, calculate 2/3 of the average of all the valid
numbers, and decide the winner.
4) Epoch switching stage: This stage reserves a certain
amount of time for the results to be broadcast and
notified to all the participants. Also, the change of
network topology and establishment of new network
connections can take place in this stage.
In every round of consensus, an IoT node only needs to
compute the hash value once and create two transactions. In
the block epoch design, we separate the number upload and
reveal stages and use hash functions to safeguard the privacy
of numbers during the consensus. The designed game-based
selection mechanism is fair, energy-efficient, and IoT-friendly.
C. Security Mechanism
Based on the characteristics of the IoT devices, we set up
two security mechanisms in the GaS consensus to resist attacks
such as the Sybil attack and the 51% attack [17].
• Radio frequency identification (RFID): RFID can be
used as a unique identification of IoT devices [18]. It
cannot be counterfeited, which guarantees the presence,
uniqueness, and traceability of IoT participants.
• Asset pledge: The IoT devices should pledge a certain
amount of assets in the transaction as a deposit when
they upload the GaS number. This deposit can be used
as a guarantee that nodes behave normally and honestly
in the network. Otherwise, the misbehaved nodes would
be punished by a loss of deposit.

D. Incentive Mechanism
The incentive mechanism is a critical driving factor to
encourage blockchain nodes to participate in a variety of
blockchain activities. In our proposed GaS consensus, the
selected major nodes are rewarded for their contributions to
maintaining the upper-layer PBFT consensus. Other nodes in
lower-layer networks, if volunteering as validators or monitors
of the GaS consensus, can be rewarded for reporting misbehav-
iors of major nodes such as not responding, selecting a wrong
winner, or postponing the consensus operations deliberately.
Once the reports are confirmed, these rewards would be taken
from the deposits of the misbehaving major nodes.
IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS
A. Simulation Settings
In this section, comprehensive simulations are provided to
show the performance of the GaS-PBFT consensus mech-
anism. We compare the performance of consensus latency,
achievable transactions per second (TPS), node capacity,3
and security of the GaS-PBFT consensus with that of the
PBFT consensus by using the configuration in Table I. Unless
otherwise specified, we set n as 4 groups, stx as 256 bytes,
shash as 32 bytes, shead as 256 bytes, and tb as 2 seconds by
default.
B. Evaluations
Fig. 3 shows the impact of the network bandwidth B,
transaction speed v, and the number of groups n on the
consensus latency. In Fig. 3(a), when fixing B as 1 Mbps
and v as 50 TPS, one can see that the GaS-PBFT consensus
latency is around 100 milliseconds (ms) which is much lower
than that in Ethereum (14 seconds per block) and Bitcoin (10
minutes per block).4 Moreover, Fig. 3(b) shows the impact on
the latency by the number of consensus groups n with v fixed
to 30 TPS. The increase in the number of groups would cause
higher communication costs, leading to a growth in latency. In
a nutshell, improving the network condition can significantly
3Theoretically, our consensus allows unlimited nodes to access. Thus, the
node capacity is defined as the maximum number of nodes that GaS can
support while every node is sending transactions at a certain speed.

reduce the consensus latency, allowing for more participating
consensus groups.
Fig. 4 demonstrates the achievable transaction speed of
the GaS-PBFT network with different B and n. A higher
bandwidth can lead to a higher achievable transaction speed,
while more groups may result in a decrease. However, when n
is set to 22 groups and B to 1 Mbps, the transaction speed of
the GaS-PBFT consensus can still reach over 180 TPS which is
significantly higher than that in Ethereum (14 TPS on average)
and Bitcoin (7 TPS on average).
Fig. 5 compares the node capacity between GaS-PBFT and
PBFT. The results show that our GaS-PBFT consensus has a
significantly higher node capacity over the PBFT. The GaS-
PBFT is capable of accommodating thousands of nodes while
achieving a transaction speed of over 1000 TPS.
Furthermore, we simulate the security performance of the
consensus under circumstances when the network crashes or in
the presence of tampering. As the number of groups increases,
the probability of successfully attacking GaS-PBFT network
decreases. In GaS-PBFT networks, an attacker controlling
more than 1/3 of the consensus groups can cause a network
crash, but the network is able to recover itself without losing
existing data. Fig. 6(a) illustrates the crash probability of the

GaS-PBFT network when there exist a varying number of
malicious devices. As one may notice, even if 10% of the
devices in the network are malicious, the probability of causing
a network failure is around 5% such that the network is still
able to make a full recovery.
As shown in Fig. 6(b), when launching an attack on the
GaS-PBFT network to tamper with the network data, the
attackers only have a 3% chance of success even if they control
20% of all devices. In addition, if the number of groups n
exceeds 7, the probability of a successful attack is even lower
than 1%. The results show strong resilience against malicious
devices and extreme security performance of our GaS-PBFT
consensus.
V. CONCLUSION
This paper proposed an IoT-friendly consensus mechanism,
GaS-PBFT, along with a hierarchical consensus network. We
introduced a secure and efficient game into the maintainer
elections of blockchains in the IoT. We also set up the
four-stage block epochs to ensure the fairness of the game
while guaranteeing the active participation of heterogeneous
IoT devices. Finally, we construct simulations to verify the
performance of GaS-PBFT. The results show that our proposed
mechanism incorporates blockchain consensus into IoT en-
vironments with massive heterogeneous resource-constrained
devices, while achieves short latency, large node capacity, high
transaction speed, and strong security performance.
