Abstract—In blockchain, transactions between parties are
regrouped into blocks, in order to be added to the blockchain’s
distributed ledger. Miners are nodes of the network that generate
new blocks that meet the consensus protocol. Thus, when a
miner adds a valid block to the distributed ledger, the miner
is rewarded. Due to the difficulty of the problem to be solved by
the miner in order to find a valid block, it becomes difficult to
a single miner to gain rewards. Therefore, miners join mining
pools, where the powers of miners are federated to ensure stable
revenues for miners. In public blockchains, access to mining
pools is not restricted, which makes mining pools vulnerable to
considerable threats such as: block withholding (BWH) attacks
and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. In the present
work, we a new blockchain named PoolCoin that manages
reputation in mining pools. In addition, we provide a trust
model for PoolCoin, inspired by the job market signaling model.
The proposed PoolCoin blockchain allows pool managers to
accept trusted miners in their mining pools, while miners are
able to evaluate pool managers. The performance evaluation
is conducted and the obtained simulation results are presented
and discussed. In order to study the efficiency of the proposed
trust model, a performance evaluation was provided. Thus, the
model parameters’ are optimized in order to detect and exclude
misbehaving miners, while honest miners are maintained in the
mining pool.

I. INTRODUCTION
The blockchain was introduced for the first time by the
creator(s) of Bitcoin in [1]. Due to the success of Bitcoin,
many other blockchains have appeared. A blockchain uses
a data structure called distributed ledger, that consists in an
ordered list of transactions, regrouped into blocks. The same
copy of the distributed ledger should be shared between all the
nodes of the system. A blockchain uses a consensus protocol,
in order to ensure that all nodes agree replicated updates on
the distributed ledger [2].
Different consensus protocols are used in blockchains, such
as Proof-Of-Work (PoW), Proof-Of-Stake (PoS), Practical
Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), etc. The Proof-Of-Work
(PoW) is used by common blockchains, such as BitCoin and
Ethereum [3]. In order to validate transactions, Proof Of Work
(PoW) involves scanning for a value that when hashed, the
hash begins with a number of zero bits. The average work
required is exponential with the number of zero bits required.
However, the verification requires executing only a single hash.
[1]
Nodes that verify transactions and participate in the gener-
ation of new blocks are called miners. From a single miner’s
point of view, the interval between mining events exhibits
high variance. By consequence, miners organize themselves
into mining pools, in order to make the mining revenues more
predictable. All members of a pool work together to mine
blocks, and share their revenues when one of them successfully
mines a block [4].
In the mining pool, miners submit to the pool manager
partial proofs of work (also known as textitshares), having
a difficulty level less than the difficulty level of the proof of
work acceptable by the network. The pool manager, checks
the submitted shares, in order to find among them a full proof
of work valid according to the consensus protocol. This full
proof will be used to claim the mining reward [4].
Mining pools use reward systems based on shares submitted
by miners. For instance, in Proportional Payout Schema (PPS),
a miner is rewarded proportionally to the number of its shares
[5]. One of the commonly used reward mechanism is Pay-Per-
Last-N-Shares (PPLNS), which distributes the reward among
the miners that reported the N last shares [6].
Mining pools are competing between them to find valid
blocks. Therefore, a mining pool may be confronted to a
distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack from other mining
pools [7]. Another attack on mining pools is the block with-
holding (BWH) attack, where malicious miners submit only
partial proofs and withdraw those that represent a full proof
of work [4]. The BWH attack uses the fact that miners are
rewarded according to their submitted shares.
Haddadou et al. in [8] proposed a distributed trust model
named DTM2, based on the economical job market signaling
model. DTM2 allocates credits to nodes and securely manage
them using Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs). DTM2 applies
costs on data reception and sending. In addition, nodes that
send useful data, receive rewards.
In order to incite miners to behave honestly, Tang et al.
proposed in [9] a reputation based mechanism for mining
pools. In this work, the reputation of each miner is evaluated
by a miner selected randomly, that will play the role of Pool
Manager. However, the reputation system proposed in [9] is

vulnerable, due to the fact that the Pool Manager is randomly
selected. In fact, if a malicious miner is selected as the Pool
Manager, the malicious miner will be able to drive attacks on
the mining pool. In addition, in [9], pool managers are able
to evaluate miners, while miners are not able to evaluate pool
managers.
In this paper, we propose to introduce the distributed trust
model, in the miner selection problem. Therefore, we propose
the PoolCoin blockchain that manages miners’ reputations.
The reputation of a miner is stored in the blockchain as a
trust score. According to the miners’ trust scores, a pool
manager selects miners that can join its mining pool. The main
contributions of this research work are:
• The proposition of PoolCoin, a blockchain that manages
reputation of miners and pool managers
• The proposition of a trust model inspired by the job
market signaling model
• Optimization of model’s parameters, in order to detect
malicious miners and differentiate them from honest
miners
II. RELATED WORKS
Rewards provided to miners incite malicious nodes in the
blockchain to attack miners. For instance, in Selfish Mining
attack, a strong attacker increases its revenue at the expense
of others nodes [10]. In fact, in the Selfish Mining strategy
a group of miners keeps its discovered blocks private, to
intentionally generate forks in the chain. Thus, the group
develops a longer branch in the public chain, kept private. The
selfish miners reveal their private blockchain, only when the
length of public branch approaches the public branch’s length
[11].
Individual miners tend to join mining pools in order to
secure stable benefits [12]. Thus, mining pools represents a
valuable target for attackers. In addition to existing attacks on
blockchains, mining pools are faced to special attacks such as
the DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attack and the block
withholding (BWH) attack.
Johnson et al. [7] studied the motivation behind the DDoS
(distributed denial-of-service) attack against Bitcoin mining
pools. Their study shown that, there is a greater incentive to
attack a larger mining pool than a smaller one. In addition, they
observed that mining pools larger than a threshold are subject
to economically motivated attacks, while pools smaller than
the threshold are not.
In the block withholding (BWH) attack, malicious miners
don’t submit full proof of work used by the pool manager
to add a valid block and claim its reward. Bag and Sakurai
proposed in [4] a solution to the BWH (Block Withholding)
attack, by introducing a special reward for the miner that
shared the full proof of work.
Due to the importance of the miner, the selection of miners
is crucial for the security of the blockchain. Yahiatene and
Rachedi proposed in [13] a distributed algorithm named DM-
CDS (Distributed Miners Connected Dominating Set), where
the selection of miners is based on a trust metric and network
parameters.
In a recent research work [9], Tang et al. proposed a
reputation based mechanism that incites miners to behave
honestly. For a blockchain composed of J miners and I mining
Pool, a pool manager Mi is selected randomly. The latter will
choose a reputation access threshold v0, such that only miners
with reputation value greater than v0 can join the mining pool.
The reputation evaluation of a miner j is based on the Pool
Manager’s satisfaction.
Nojoumian et al. in [14], proposed a trust model based on
the miner’s lifetime in order to avoid that a Re-Entry attack,
where a miner previously excluded from a mining pool comes-
back with a new identity. The proposed trust model relies on
the seniority of miners and includes the lifetime of miners in
the miners’ reputation.
The Distributed Trust Model (DTM2) proposed by Had-
dadou et al. [8], provides a reputation based trust model,
that incite network’s nodes to cooperate honestly. The trust
proposed trust model of DTM2 is inspired by the job market
signaling model. To send a message, a node should pay a cost
that will be covered by the reward, if the message is considered
correct. Furthermore, to receive messages, receivers also pay
a reception cost. By consequences, nodes are incited to send
correct messages on the network.
III. THE POOLCOIN BLOCKCHAIN
In this section, we will present the proposed blockchain
called PoolCoin, used to manage the miners’ reputation. Thus,
we will begin with a system overview of PoolCoin, followed
by the trust model used by PoolCoin for miners’ reputation.
A. System Overview
The proposed PoolCoin system is composed of Pool Man-
agers, Miners, Mining Pools, and the PoolCoin’s distributed
ledger (Fig. 1). A Pool Manager receives transactions from
the blockchain, then it distributes workload between miners,
in order to find a valid block. When a valid block is found,
the Pool Manager distributes the corresponding reward among
miners that participated in the mining process. The Miner
performs computations in order to find a valid block and send
it back to the Pool Manager. The Miner sends shares (partial
proofs of work) to the Pool Manager, in order to proof that it
participated to the mining process. These shares will be used
by the Pool Manager to determine the Miner’s revenue. A
Mining Pool is formed by the Pool Manager and Miners join
it, in order to ensure stable revenues. A Pool Manager uses
the reputation of miners to accept them in its Mining Pool.
The PoolCoin’s distributed ledger is stored in a distributed
manner among nodes of PoolCoin: Miners and Pool Managers.
This distributed ledgers stores information relative to miners’
reputation. The Pool Managers affect workload to miners that
have sufficient trust score.
B. PoolCoin’s Transactions
In PoolCoin, a transaction is composed of six (06) fields:

Fig. 1. System overview
• From: represents the address of the sender.
• To: represents the address of the receiver.
• Value: The value of funds received by the miner indicated
in the To field from the mining pool mentioned in the
From field.
• RepValue: indicates the reputation value transferred from
the sender to the receiver.
• Complaint: used to store complaints of miners against
malicious pool manager
• ExtraInfo holds information such as: nonce, signatures,
etc.
The RepValue field is used for the management of the min-
ers’ reputation. In addition, the Complaint field allows miners
to report misbehaving pool managers. The Complaint field
is composed of: Level, FundLosses, and ReputationLosses.
Level measures the critically of the complaint. FundLosses
and ReputationLosses represent the losses caused by a pool
manager. The pool manager is specified in the ”TO” field of the
transaction. Likewise, the miner that complained is specified
in the ”FROM” field of the la transaction.
C. The Mining process in PoolCoin
In PoolCoin, the Pool Manager receives transactions from
the Blockchain. Then, once it selects transactions to be in-
cluded in the block, it broadcast the block’s template to the
miners usbscribed to its mining pool. To participate in the
mining process, miners should pay a mining cost Cminining ,
using their trust score. Only miners that paid their mining cost
are able to participate in the mining pool. By consequence,
miners that their trust score is low, cannot participate to the
mining pool.
The allowed miners will receive workload according to
the paid mining cost. To proof that miners are honestly
participating to the mining process, miners send Proof-Of-
Works (PoWs) to the Pool Manager. We distinct two kinds
of PoWs: Full PoWs and Partial PoWs. Full PoWs allows to
the Pool Manager to claim the block reward, while the Partial
Pool Manager

PoWs, allows the Pool Manager to check that miners are
honestly participating to the mining process. The number of
partial PoWs should be proportional to the received workload.
At each Round, the Pool managers provides to miners a reward
W(Y) according to their participation in the mining process.
The Pool manager provides a financial reward R according to
its reward system. The financial reward R can be transferred to
any blockchain using the pegged sidechains technology [15].
If the miner is not satisfied by the obtained rewards, PoolCoin
allow it to store a Complaint in the blockchain, using the data
field of the transactions. Thus, PoolCoins provides protection
mechanisms against malicious Pool Managers. Fig. 2 shows
the mining process using PoolCoin.
D. The trust model of PoolCoin
In this section, we will present the trust model used by
PoolCoin to manage the reputation of miners. When a Miner
wants to join a mining pool, he should be able to pay the
mining cost Cmining from its trust score. According to his
hash rate, the miner use a signal Y corresponding to its
computing capacity (in terms of gigahash per second). The
mining cost Cmining to be paid to the Pool Manager is
proportional to the signal Y. However, the mining cost Cmining
decreases when the miner’s trust score θ increases. In fact, the
mining cost Cmining that the Miner pays the Pool Manager is
calculated as follows:
Cmining =
Y
θ
1
Y+α
(1)
The Pool Manager affects workload to a miner according
to the used signal Y. If the miner doesn’t provide any share to
the Pool Manager, the latter will not update its trust score θ.
However, if the miner behaves honestly, the Pool Manager
will reward it according to the number of shares and the
used signal Y. More precisely, the number of partial shares
(npPoWs) is divided by the signal Y to incite the miner to use
its real capacity in the signal Y. In addition, to reward miners

those find and provide full shares. Thus, the pool manager will
provide to the miner the reward W(Y) calculated as described
in the formula below. The parameter β is used to incite to
share the solution with the Pool Manager when found.
W (Y ) =

+ β.nfPoWs (2)
The trust score θ of a miner determines the reputation of the
mining among different Mining Pool. This will allow a miner
to transfer his trust score when it moves from one mining pool
to another. When a miner joins the system, it obtains an initial
score θinit. The value of the initial score should as small as
possible; in order to limit dishonest miners that uses several
identities in mining.
E. Mining pools formation
To reward miners, Pool Managers should have sufficient
reputation score. In fact, unlike [9] where Pool Managers are
randomly selected among miners, Pool Coins requires that
only miners with sufficient reputation are able to become Pool
Managers. In fact, in PoolCoin Pool Managers should have
sufficient funds to reward the miners. By consequence, miners
before joining a mining pool, they should check that its Pool
Manager has a reputation score sufficient to reward its miners.
The miners joins a mining pool based on the pool’s rank,
calculated based on the reputation of its pool manager and
the complaints stored in the PoolCoin’s transactions. To rank
mining pools, for each transaction of PoolCoin containing
complaints, the ranking algorithm (Algorithm 1) calculates
the complaint score cs, based on the complaint’s information.
The algorithm updates the ranking of the Pool Manager based
on θm(the trust level of the miner) and cs (the calculated
complaint score).
IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In this section we will study the performance of the
proposed trust model. Thus, we considered several miners’
behaviors and studied the performance of the proposed model.
We also extracted optimal parameters of the model.
Algorithm 1: RankingPoolManagers
for each b in PoolCoin.getBlocks() do
for each tx in b.getTransactions() do
lv = tx.complaint.Level
fl = tx.complaint.FundLosses
rl = tx.complaint.ReputationLosses
cs = complainteScore(lv, fl, rl)
adrPM = tx.getTo()
adrMiner = tx.getFrom()
θm = getTrustScore(adrMiner)
updateRanking(adrPM, θminer, cs)
end for
end for
A. Experimental setup
We developed a program in Python that simulates the
PoolCoin blockchain, in order to evaluate the trust model.
Thus, we considered the trust model presented section III-D.
To study the reactivity of our system, we considered exclusion
time of miners, expressed in terms of number of mining
pool required to exclude the miner from the mining process.
Likewise to optimize the model’s parameters (section IV-C),
we considered the exclusion time of miners. In order to
study the reliability of the proposed model (section IV-D),
we considered the evolution of the miners’ trust score.
To study reactivity of our system, we observed the exclusion
time according to the variation of the initial trust score θinit.
The model’s parameter α is equal to 0, the other parameters
β and δ are assigned to 1. We considered different scenarios
of Miners behaviors and for each scenario, we observed the
evolution of miners’ trust score during ten (10) mining rounds.
We observed the score of each miner after each mining Round
Ri, while R0 corresponds to the initial state before mining.
The first scenario Honest Miner corresponds to a honest
miner.
The second Scenario BWH Malicious Miner corresponds
to a malicious miner that didn’t share the solution of the puzzle
(the proof of work accepted by the network). In other terms, it
corresponds to a malicious miner that performs a BWH (Block
Withholding) attack.
The third scenario Absolute Malicious Miner corresponds
to a malicious miner that didn’t contribute to solve the
computational puzzle.
The other scenarios Alternate n% Malicious Miners
alternate between honest and malicious behaviours, where
n represents the percentage of the malicious behavior. We
considered three such scenarios: Alternate 80% Malicious
Miners, Alternate 50% Malicious Miners, and Alternate
20% Malicious Miners
B. Results analysis
In order to study the impact of the choice on the efficiency
of the reputation system of PoolCoin, we varied the initial
score in order to get optimized value for the initial score
θinitial. The results shown in Fig. 3, shows the evolution of
the exclusion time (in terms of number of rounds) according
to the variation of the initial trust score.
As shown in Fig. 3, θinitial < 1, all miners are excluded in
the first round. For other values of θinitial, Absolute Malicious
Miners are rejected, while other miners are not detected. We
observe that θinitial values between 1 and 2, provide optimized
exclusion time (2 mining rounds). In order to keep the initial
trust score as small as possible, we choose 1 as optimal value
of θinitial.However, the considered model parameters should
be optimized in order to detect: Alternate Malicious Miners
and BWH Malicious Miner.
C. Parameters optimization
In order to enhance the accuracy of our model, we will
optimize the value of the model’s parameters. By consequence,

we will consider the optimal value of the initial trust (1), and
extract optimal values of the model’s parameters: α, β, and δ.
1) Optimized value of the parameter δ: To extract the opti-
mized value of the parameter δ, we considered the optimized
value of the initial score (1). In addition, the other model’s
parameters α and β are assigned to 0 and 1, respectively. The
evolution of the miner’s exclusion time according to the value
of the parameter δ, is shown in Fig. 4. We note that for values
greater than 2, the Honest Miner is excluded from the mining
pool. In addition, other values of the parameter δ, don’t detect
some dishonest miners, namely: BWH Malicious Miner and
Alternate 20% Miner. By consequence, we conclude that the
optimal value of the parameter δ is 2.
2) Optimized value of the parameter β: Using the optimal
values of θinitial = 1 and the parameter δ = 2, we will extract
the optimal value of the parameter β. Fig. 5 shows the behavior
of the model according to the variation of the parameter β.
We remark that, for values of the parameter β less than 0.1,
the Honest Miner is excluded from the mining pool. However,
for values of the parameter β greater than 0.1, the exclusion
time is constant. Thus, we choose the value 0.1 as the optimal
value for the parameter β.
3) Optimized value of the parameter α: In order to optimize
α, we considered: θinitial = 1, δ = 2, and β = 0.1. As shown
in Fig. 6, the values of the parameter α greater than 0.02
exclude the Honest Miner. In addition, for values less than

0.02, the exclusion times of misbehaving miners are constants.
By consequence, any value of the parameter α less than 0.02
is optimal. Thus, we consider the value 0.02 as the optimal
value of the parameter α.
D. Reliability of the model
To study the reliability of our proposed model we studied
the evolution of the trust score of the different scenarios
through the mining rounds. We considered the optimal values
of model parameters’: α = 0.02, β = 0.1, δ = 2, and
θinitial = 1. Fig. 7 shows the evolution of the miners’ trust
score during the ten mining rounds.
As shown by Fig. 7, the trust model of PoolCoin allows the
Honest Miner to maintain a trust score allowing it to stay in
the mining pool as long as it behaves honestly. When a miner
alternate between honest and dishonest behaviors (Alternate
Malicious n% Scenario), the trust score decreases in order to
achieve a trust score that excludes the miner from the mining
pool. The exclusion time is three mining rounds regardless of
the percentage of the misbehaving. In addition, the trust model
of PoolCoin is able to detect the BWH (Block With Holding)
attacks at the 10th mining round (R10), when the trust score
of the BWH Malicious Miner achieves the score of 2.76.
V. SECURITY ANALYSIS
The proposed trust model of PoolCoin detects five profiles
of misbehaving miners: BWH Malicous, Absolute Malicous,

The proposed trust model of PoolCoin protects Pool Man-
agers against malicious miners that try to perform a distributed
denial of service (DDoS) attacks. In fact, if all the miners
that coordinate their efforts in order to perform a DDoS
attack, behave as Absolute Malicious Miner, the trust model of
PoolCoin will detect them and exclude them from the mining
pool. Likewise, if the miners alternate between honest and
dishonest behaviours, they will be also detected and excluded
from the mining pool. Furthermore, the detected miners will
be denied from all the mining pools using PoolCoin.
The trust model of PoolCoin detect and exclude from
the mining pools, miners that fellow the BWH Malicious
Miner’s behavior. By consequence, mining pools are protected
against the well know BWH attack. Compared to the solution
proposed in [4], the proposed solution doesn’t require the
affectation of a special financial reward to the miner that share
the full PoW. In addition, as the contrary to the solution of [4],
the trust model is able to detect the miner’s that performed the
BWH attack and exclude it from the mining pool.
The proposed trust model of PoolCoin is able to detect
malicious miners, in order to exclude them from the mining
pool. Furthermore, miners that perform malicious attacks are
excluded from all the mining pools of the blockchain. By
consequence, miners are dissuaded from attacking mining
pools. However, the trust model of PoolCoin requires that
miners uses Trust Platform Modules (TPMs), in order to avoid
Re-entry attacks, where malicious miner use a new identity to
be accepted in the system.
As described in section III-E, in PoolCoin only miners with
high reputation are able to become Pool Managers. Thereby,
unlike [9], a malicious miner is not able to become a Pool
Manager. Furthermore, miners are able to report misbehaving
Pool Managers, thanks to the complaint transactions stored in
the distributed ledger of PoolCoin.
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS
Mining pools are mainly faced to two kinds of attacks: block
withholding (BWH) attacks and distributed denial of service
(DDoS) attacks. In the present paper, we proposed PoolCoin a
blockchain that deals with reputations of miners. The PoolCoin
blockchain provides a trust model that protects mining pool
against misbehaving miners. The trust model of PoolCoin is
inspired by the job market signaling model. The parameters
of the trust model were optimized in order to exclude only
misbehaving miners. The optimized parameters of the trust
model efficiently protect mining pools from attacks such
as DDoS and BWH attacks. Furthermore, PoolCoin allows
also to evaluate the Pool Managers’ reputation, based on the
complaints stored by miners in the blockchain. As future work,
we aim to integrate PoolCoin and its turst model in BitCoin
Blockchain.
In order to detect Re-Entry attacks, where malicious miner
attack the mining pool using different identities, PoolCoin
relies on Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs). As a future work,
we will integrate the miner’s lifetime in our trust model, in
order to incite miners to use unique identity.
