Abstract—Open-access blockchains based on proof-of-work protocols have gained tremendous popularity for their capabilities of
providing decentralized tamper-proof ledgers and platforms for data-driven autonomous organization. Nevertheless, the proof-of-work
based consensus protocols are vulnerable to cyber-attacks such as double-spending. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of
cyber risk management for blockchain-based service. In particular, we adopt the cyber-insurance as an economic tool for neutralizing
cyber risks due to attacks in blockchain networks. We consider a blockchain service market, which is composed of the infrastructure
provider, the blockchain provider, the cyber-insurer, and the users. The blockchain provider purchases from the infrastructure provider,
e.g., a cloud, the computing resources to maintain the blockchain consensus, and then offers blockchain services to the users. The
blockchain provider strategizes its investment in the infrastructure and the service price charged to the users, in order to improve the
security of the blockchain and thus optimize its profit. Meanwhile, the blockchain provider also purchases a cyber-insurance from the
cyber-insurer to protect itself from the potential damage due to the attacks. In return, the cyber-insurer adjusts the insurance premium
according to the perceived risk level of the blockchain service. Based on the assumption of rationality for the market entities, we model
the interaction among the blockchain provider, the users, and the cyber-insurer as a two-level Stackelberg game. Namely, the
blockchain provider and the cyber-insurer lead to set their pricing/investment strategies, and then the users follow to determine their
demand of the blockchain service. Specifically, we consider the scenario of double-spending attacks and provide a series of analytical
results about the Stackelberg equilibrium in the market game.

1 INTRODUCTION
IN the past fewyears, blockchain technologies have attracted
tremendous attention from both industry and academia for
distributively providing the irreversible, tamper-evident
database of tokenized asset transactions [1]. Furthermore,
with the smart contracts [2] enabled on top of the decentral-
ized consensus [1], blockchains are envisaged to be the “game
changer” in various areas ranging from Peer-to-Peer (P2P)
resource allocation/trading, e.g., distributed cloud storage [3],
to financial services, e.g., digital identity management [4] and
online markets for crowdsourcing services [5]. Although with
the advantages such as open access, disintermediation, and
pure self-organization, open-access/permissionless block-
chains rely on the condition of honest majority to guarantee
the data integrity and service security, especially when the
Nakamoto consensus protocol based on proof-of-work (PoW)
is adopted [1]. Since permissionless blockchain networks
admit no identity control, they can be vulnerable to a series of
insider attacks by malicious consensus nodes [6]. Among
different types of attacks, double spending [7] is the most fun-
damental one and can be executed through various attacks
such as goldfinger attacks, netsplit attacks and brute-force
attacks [6]. In brief, a double-spending attacker attempts to
simultaneously spend the same set of blockchain tokens in
two different transactions. This can be performed by first per-
suading part of the network and the transaction receiver to
confirm one transaction, and then persuading the majority of
the network to override that transaction with a conflicting
transaction spending the same set of tokens. In other words,
double-spending attacks are executed through intentional
blockchain forking. Due to the factors such as randomness in
solving the PoW puzzles [1] and information propagation
delay, the malicious nodes, i.e., attackers, only need to hold
a certain level of PoW computing power to succeed with
a high probability in the double-spending attacks. Note here
that although the double-spending attack is initially devised
for Bitcoin, the attack is also applicable to other blockchain-
based resource trading services and systems, for example,
energy trading [8], plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV)
charging credit management [9], wireless spectrum trad-
ing [10], bandwidth exchange in community networks [11]
and cache storage trading [12].
Although a few approaches, e.g., [13], have been intro-
duced in blockchains to deter and prevent attacks, due to
the inherent characteristics of openness, the PoW-based

permissionless blockchain networks may not be completely
secure. This critically hinders the broader adoption of permis-
sionless blockchains, especially in business services that
require high-level service security. Along with the studies on
the improvement of blockchain protocols, blockchain service
providers are also looking for an alternative means of cyber-
risk management. Recently, cyber-insurance has been recog-
nized as a promising approach to efficientlymanage the cyber
risks by transferring them to insurers [14]. Similar to the tradi-
tional insurance, the customer of a cyber-insurance product,
i.e., a policyholder, is insured once it settles the contract with
the insurer by paying a premium. If attacks happen and the
damage is within the coverage of the insurance policy,
the insurer will pay the claim to the customer accordingly.
To date, a number of cyber-insurance products have been
made available in the market [15]. According to the types of
target systems, these products can be categorized into specific
groups designed for service providers such as ISPs and
clouds, single mobile/work stations, networks of devices and
dedicated cyber-physical/industrial systems.
In this paper, we introduce a novel approach of jointly
providing the risk management and security enhancement
to the blockchain users and providers against attacks
through the means of the cyber-insurance. As in other insur-
able cyber-systems, the market design of cyber-insurance
for blockchain networks also has to address a few important
issues. First, from the cyber-insurer’s perspective, the scope
and policy of the cyber-insurance have to be clearly defined
in regard to what kind of attacks to be covered and how to
quantify the risk, the possible damage and thus the insur-
ance premium. Second, alongside the reactive risk transfer
with the cyber-insurance, rational blockchain providers also
have to consider the proactive strategy in security improve-
ment and thus balance the investment in the infrastructure
and in the cyber-insurance.
To answer these questions, we consider a PoW-based
blockchain service market under the threat of double-
spending attacks (see Fig. 1). Themarket is composed of three
entities, namely, the users, the blockchain provider, and the
cyber-insurer. The users subscribe to a service, e.g., P2P
energy trading for smart grids, which is implemented on top
of the blockchain provided by the blockchain provider. We
consider that the blockchain provider is composed of a group
of individual honest machines which are responsible for
maintaining the data consensus in the framework of PoW-
based permissionless blockchains. The blockchain provider
purchases the computing resource from cloud-based infra-
structure providers1 or deploysmore computing power inter-
nally for maintaining the network consensus. Meanwhile,
in order to lower the cost on infrastructure, third-party devi-
ces are encouraged to join the decentralized consensus pro-
cess by dedicating their individual computing resources into
the network. Working as a single blockchain provider, the
group of consensus machines make profit by charging the
users with the transaction processing fees and block mining
fees [1]. To neutralize the economic/financial loss incurred by
double-spending attacks, the blockchain provider purchases
the insurance from the cyber-insurer, which adopts an adjust-
able premium pricing strategy according to its perceived risk
level of the blockchain.
We propose a two-stage Stackelberg game model to ana-
lyze the dynamics of the considered market. On the upper
stage of the game, the blockchain provider and the cyber-
insurer lead to adopt their best-response strategies for profit
maximization. On the lower stage, the users adjust their
service demands according to the cost and the security level
of the blockchain. More specifically, the major contributions
of this paper are summarized as follows:
(1) We formulate the mechanisms of blockchain service
pricing, blockchain infrastructure investment and
cyber-insurance premiumadjustment as a jointmarket
equilibrium problem. We model the interactions
among the three parties in the market as a two-level
Stackelberg game.We provide and prove a few impor-
tant theoretical discoveries regarding the properties of
the equilibrium in themarket game.
(2) We incorporate the social externality [17], [18] among
blockchain users in our end-user utility model. Also,
by modeling the impact of computing power on
the blockchain security, we consider the blockchain
provider’s strategy to incorporate both dimensions
of infrastructure investment and insurance spend-
ings. Furthermore, by adopting the concept of “risk-
adjusted premium”, we mathematically capture the
impact of attack probability on premium pricing from
the cyber-insurer’s perspective.
(3) We conduct extensive evaluation to assess the per-
formance of the three parties with their equilibrium
strategies at different levels of the attacker-controlled
computing power.
The proposedmarket framework introduces a novel incen-
tive-compatible business ecosystem, where the blockchain
service users benefit from enjoying more resilient services,
and both the blockchain provider and the cyber-insurer are
able to gain more profits. In fact, the potential of cyber-
insurance for blockchain, Bitcoin specifically, has been per-
ceived in the market. For example, Petra Insurance Brokers
(www.insurewithpetra.com) introduces the concept of insur-
ance for Bitcoin transactions. Likewise, BitCoin Financial
Group unveils “BitSecure”, which is a Bitcoin theft insurance
policy (www.bitcoinfinancialgroup.com). This product covers
both external hacking and employee theft. Moreover, more

insurance products are emerging inwhich a fewof them focus
on general blockchain services. Therefore, our proposed con-
cept and framework of cyber insurance for blockchain serv-
ices has a clear and direct practical implication. Moreover,
from the perspective ofmarket design, the blockchain services
are typically highly customized for a certain environment and
application. Thus, we consider the mutual trading between
single insurer and single provider. The model of a many-to-
many market for multiple insurers and providers is likely to
be intractable and needs further development, and hence it is
beyond the scope of this paper. Finally, the model developed
in this paper can be readily extended to blockchains with the
emerging consensus protocols based on the generalized proof
of concepts [1], where investment in other resources, e.g.,
stakes, is needed to prevent attacks.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2
presents the related work. Section 3 describes the prelimi-
naries about blockchains and cyber-insurance, the system
model, and the formulation of Stackelberg game. Section 4
investigates the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium
in the proposed Stackelberg game under practical assump-
tions. Section 5 presents the numerical performance evalua-
tion. Section 6 concludes the paper.
2 RELATED WORKS
The permissionless blockchain network was originally con-
ceptualized in the famous grassroot cryptocurrency proj-
ect “Bitcoin” as a decentralized database for tamper-proof
recording and trusted timestamping for the transactional data
between P2P users. Permissionless blockchains have been
widely recognized for the superb consensus scalability, the
tamper-evidence data organization and the capability of sup-
porting the distributed, general-purpose virtual machines [1],
[19]. For this reason, in recent years there has seen a plethora
of emerging application based on blockchains such as Internet
finance and property digitization [20], self-organization for
Internet of Things [21] and other nonfinancial applications,
e.g., notary documents and anti-counterfeit solutions [22].
Permissionless blockchain networks creatively solve the
problems of replicated consensus in open-access networks
by introducing the financial incentive and cryptical zero-
knowledge proof into the consensus process [1]. More specifi-
cally, any node in the blockchain network is allowed to issue
digitally signed transactions to other nodes by “broadcasting”
the transactions in a gossip manner over the P2P links
between the nodes. The consensus nodes pack up an arbitrary
subset of unapproved transactions into a cryptographically
protected data structure, i.e., the “block”, and rival with each
other in a block publishing race (also known as block mining)
to acquire the block mining reward [23]. Following the Naka-
moto protocol for blockchain state maintenance [1], the
consensus nodes only accept the longest chain among all the
locally observable candidates of the blockchain state as their
canonical view of the blockchain. To determine the winner
of a block mining race, the consensus nodes have to perform
an exhaustive search for the solutions of the crypto-puzzles
built upon their proposed blocks. In other words, the nodes
that acquire more computing power will have higher proba-
bility of winning the race and hence the more power of
controlling the blockchain state [1]. Therefore, the honest con-
sensus nodes have to secure a sufficiently large amount of
computing power to guarantee the well-being of the block-
chain services, e.g., data integrity [23]. Grabbing more com-
puting power, on the other hand, is also from which the
malicious nodes start to breach the blockchain networks.
Cyber-insurance, in themeanwhile, has been recognized as
an innovative tool to manage the cyber risks and alleviate
the damage of cyber-attacks for the insured customers [24].
Cyber-insurance provides the coverage on losses and liab-
ilities from network/information security breaches. This
greatly incentivizes the security investments by cyber-
physical systems. However, compared with classical insur-
ance, cyber-insurance introduces a number of unique issues.
For example, due to the interdependence of security systems
or lack of statistical data, it is difficult to assess the systems’
vulnerability and hence hard to estimate the risk transferred
to the cyber-insurer [15]. For the transaction-oriented cyber
services built upon permissionless blokchains, the designer of
cyber-insurance also faces the similar issues. Nevertheless,
recent studies on the mechanisms of double-spending
attacks [25], [26], [27] have shed light upon the possible
approaches in analytically assessing the risks of this funda-
mental threat on the blockchain systems. For example, in [25],
the authors proposed a new protocol which requires the con-
sensus nodes, i.e., block miners, to confirm transactions only
if the inputs of the transactions have not been spent, hence
preventing users fromdouble-spending their funds. Based on
the characteristics of intentional forking in double-spending
attacks, the authors in [26], [27] introduced the methods to
estimate the probability of successful double-spending
attacks by analyzing the investments in computing resource
of both the blockchain maintainers and attackers. With these
studies, it is now possible to estimate the probability of suc-
cessful double spending and evaluate the potential risks
transferred to the cyber-insurers.
Furthermore, under the condition that the probability
distribution of risk can be estimated, the authors in [28]
proposed a risk-adjusted premium for pricing risks based
on the Proportional Hazard (PH) transform, namely, a
power transform in the decumulative distribution func-
tion of the risks. Since the PH transform satisfies the ele-
mentary principles of assigning premiums, i.e., scale-
invariance and translation-invariance, it has been adopted
in a number of works concerning the premium determi-
nation. In addition, a class of premium functions which
are comonotonicity additive and stochastic dominance
preservative were studied in [29]. Therein, the premium
determination method based on the PH transform was
generalized with an axiomatic approach, and the princi-
ples such as the absolute deviation principle [30] were
thoroughly studied and compared.
However, to the best of our knowledge, it still remains
an open field of research to employ the cyber-insurance for
alleviating the damage of double-spending attack for the
blockchain providers. The aforementioned works inspire
a vision of quantifying the risk of double-spending attacks
based on the computing resources owned by the blockchain
maintainers and attackers. Then, the corresponding insurance
premium can be determined under the framework based
on the PH transform. By transferring the risks caused by
double spending to the cyber-insurers, the cyber-physical
services residing on the blockchains can bemuchmore robust.
This is also themajor objective of our studies.

3 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND GAME FORMULATION
In this section, we first introduce the model of successful
attack probability for double spending and the concept of
risk-adjusted premium. After formulating the utilities of the
blockchain provider, the users, and the cyber-insurer, we
investigate the problem of users’ service demand, service
pricing and infrastructure, i.e., computing power, invest-
ment by the blockchain provider and premium pricing by
the cyber-insurer jointly as a hierarchical market game.
The cyber-insurance for blockchain-based service under
our consideration works as follows. The blockchain provider
firsts pay the premium determined by the cyber-insurer.
If the double-spending attack happens, which is detected by
the provider or users, the provider files the claims to the
cyber-insurer. The cyber-insurer verifies the claim andmakes
the payment to the provider to compensate for the damage of
the double spending. The methods to detect and verify the
double spending attack are available and can be adopted, e.g.,
by deploying an observer as in [31], and hence they are not
the focus of this paper.
3.1 Preliminaries
3.1.1 Successful Attack Probability
We consider that the honest consensus nodes work jointly as
a single blockchain provider and are responsible formaintain-
ing a permissionless, PoW-based blockchain for service provi-
sion. Extending the analysis in [26] and [27], we assume that
during a time period of T , the total computing resource of the
blockchain network measured by the hash rate is fixed as H.
Following the Nakamoto consensus protocol, every consen-
sus node runs an independent Poisson process for puzzle-
solving. The average time for a new block to be mined in the
blockchain network is T0 [1]. Then, in the time period of T ,
the expected number of blocks being successfully mined in
the network is T
T0
. Let h denote the investment in computing
resources by the blockchain provider, i.e., the honest nodes,
and a denote the investment in computing resources by the
attackers. Then, if the computing efficiency for hash queries
are roughly the same, the blockchain provider and the attack-
ers divide the total computing resource H as �hH and �aH,
respectively, where �h ¼ h
aþh and �a ¼ a
aþh are the investment
ratios. According to the probabilistic model for winning the
PoW-based puzzle solving race [26], the number of blocks
that are mined by the blockchain provider and waiting for
confirmation during T is T
T0
�hH
H ¼ T
T0
�h. On the other hand,
instead of following the Poisson distribution based model,
the number of blocks successfully mined by attackers during
T can be accurately modeled as a negative binomial vari-
able [26]. Therefore, with the investment ratio �h, the probabil-
ity for attackers to succeed in double spending during T can
be expressed as follows (see Theorem 1 in [27]):

with G �ð Þ being the gamma function. The model of exponen-
tial decay in (1) is discovered in [32] and proved in [27].
We consider that the blockchain provider receives pay-
ments from the users in the form of transaction fees in a
confirmed block. Under double-spending attacks, the block-
chain provider has to compensate the loss of the users with
a fixed rate for each transaction in the block that is finally
overridden. Assume that the number of transactions
included in each block is the same, and hence the transac-
tion fee and compensation rate are fixed for each transac-
tion. Let NT denote the number of transactions in a block, r
denote the block mining reward for each block and q denote
the total compensation rate for each block. Then, with the
investment ratio �h, the blockchain provider’s potential loss
is T
T0
�hNTq under the double-spending attack, and the proba-
bility of successful attack is:

2 . Here,we only focus on the casewhere the invest-
ment ratio of the blockchain provider is no less than 1=2.
The reason is thatwhen �h < 1=2, the probability of successful
double spending is always equal to 1 as shown in (3), which is
trivial and thus not our focus.
3.1.2 Premium Determination
The cyber-insurer offers a cyber-insurance service to the
blockchain provider and covers its total loss when the attack
happens. In other words, after the blockchain provider buys
the cyber-insurance, the risk of double-spending attack will
be transferred to the cyber-insurer. By adopting the concept
of risk-adjusted premium in [29], the cyber-insurer dyn-
amically determines the price, i.e., premium, of its cyber-
insurance product according to the insurance risk distribu-
tion. According to our previous discussion, the cyber-insurer
has an insurance risk, i.e., paying the claim of T
T0
�hNTq with
the probability of P �h

given by (3). Then, the expected loss
for the cyber-insurer can be formulated as follows:

worth noting that the term ½1� R �h
1=2 P uð Þdu� in (6) is smaller
than 1. Therefore, the larger g is, the higher the premium
L gð Þwill be.
3.2 System Model
3.2.1 The User’s Utility
We suppose that each user in the blockchain service market
has a service demand, which is determined by an intrinsic
value ui from the uniform distribution FU over the interval
0; 1½ �. Here, ui can be interpreted as the probability for user i
to buy the blockchain service. We further assume that the
intrinsic values of the users are independently distributed.
The users also experience social externalities in which the
decision of one user can influence the decisions of the other
users. Let Pr j buys the service½ � denote the probability that
user j subscribes to the service, then, the utility of user i can
be expressed as follows [33]:
ui ¼ �hþ ui � pi þ a

gijPr j buys the service½ �: (7)
In (7), the first term, i.e., �h, is the investment ratio of the block-
chain provider. �h represents the positive effect owning to the
effort of the blockchain provider in preventing the security
breach due to double-spending attacks. According to (1), the
larger �h is, the lower the successful probability of double-
spending attacks is, and consequently the less the users will be
affected. The third term, i.e., pi, is the price of the service for
user i.2 The forth term of (7), i.e., a

sents the level of the social externality (influence) that user j
has on user i. We assume that gij 6¼ 0, 8i 6¼ j and gii ¼ 0,
8i 2 N .3 Finally, a is a constant controlling the level of social
externality for the entire network.
3.2.2 Profits of the Blockchain Provider and the
Cyber-insurer
The goals of the blockchain provider and the cyber-insurer are
to maximize their individual profits. Based on our previous

where the first term

On the other hand, the premium paid by the blockchain
provider is the revenue of the cyber-insurer. Due to the
uncertainty of double-spending attacks, we adopt the
expected claim as the cyber-insurer’s cost. Then, the cyber-
insurer’s payoff function can be expressed as:

the product of the successful attack probability and the total
claim paid to the blockchain provider for covering its loss.
Finally, since the premium increases as the cyber-insurer’s
decision variable g increases, a rational cyber-insurer will
keep g as high as possible to maximum its revenue. How-
ever, when the blockchain provider increases its investment
ratio, the successful attack probability will decrease. As
a result, the blockchain provider will have less incentive to
pay an extremely high premium. Therefore, we introduce
the last term in (9) to model the possibly negative impact on
the expected payoff of the cyber-insurer as both the values
of �h and g increase, which is similar to the concept of the
punishment on insurer adopted in [34]. Here, we define
s �h; g

2. Note here that the uniform pricing in which all users are charged
with the same price is a special case of the discriminative pricing
adopted in this paper.
3. Note here that our model can also be used to analyze the scenario
that the users may act independently. For example, if gij ¼ gji ¼ 0, user
j has zero level of the social externality (influence) on user i and vice
versa. Hence, users i and j act independently.

The conditions in (10) indicates that with �h > 1
2, the block-
chain provider’s effort in investing the computing resource
effectively reduces the successful attack probability. Conse-
quently, the probability of the cyber-insurer paying the claim
to the blockchain provider is also reduced. Then, keeping the
highest premium has a negative effect on the cyber-insurer’s
payoff, e.g., by hurting its reputation or curbing the incentive
for the blockchain provider to buy the insurance. Under the
other two conditions in (10), the lack of enough investment in
infrastructure of the blockchain provider will induce higher
probability of being successfully attacked, hence leading to
a positive effect on the cyber-insurer’s payoff due to the
higher demand of financial protection. Additionally, s2 gð Þ is
an increasing convex function of g and s2 gð Þjg¼1¼ 0. As such,
when g ¼ 1, the expected loss in (4) is equal to the premium
in (6), and there is no negative effect on the cyber-insurer’s
reputation. For tractable analysis, we adopt the following
model:

It is worth noting that the cyber-insurer’s payoff function in
(9) may also adopt other models for s �h; g

model in (11) has no effect on our subsequent analysis.
3.3 Stackelberg Game Formulation
Considering the payoff functions of the market entities
given in (7), (8), (9), it is natural to model the interactions in
the blockchain service market as a two-stage game. In the
first upper stage, the blockchain provider determines the
price of the blockchain service, namely, the levels of accept-
able transaction fees for each user pi, and its ratio of invest-
ment in computing resources �h. Meanwhile, the cyber-
insurer decides on the premium coefficient g by considering
the insurance risk transferred from the blockchain provider.
In the second lower stage, each user determines whether
it will buy the blockchain service or not based on the prices
and the investment ratio set by the blockchain provider.
Accordingly, the interactions among the blockchain pro-
vider, the cyber-insurer and the users are formulated as
a two-leader-multi-follower Stackelberg game. Specifically,
the mutual interaction between the blockchain provider and
cyber-insurer forms a noncooperative two-player leader-
level subgame for achieving the equilibrium of the service
price, the investment ratio, and the cyber-insurance policy.
Then, the interaction among a number of users forms the
follower-level noncooperative subgame for determining the
service demand from the blockchain provider.4 The Stackel-
berg game can be formally defined as follows.
(1) User-level noncooperative subgame: Given the fixed
investment ratio �h as well as the price vectors p ¼
p1; p2; . . . ; p Nj j
 �>
, the user-level (follower) noncoop-
erative subgame is defined by a four-tuple Gu ¼ N ;f
x;X ;ug, where
� N is the set of active users;
� X ¼ x1; x2; . . .x Nj j
 �>���xi 2 0; 1½ �; i 2 N

� x ¼ x1; x2; . . .x Nj j

decision variables, where xi is the service
demand of user i and x 2 X ;
� u ¼ u1; u2; . . . ; u Nj j
 �>
is the vector of the users’
utilities with the given strategy x, where 8i 2 N ,
and ui is given in (7).
(2) Leader-level noncooperative subgame: Assume that the
users’ demand x has been found to be a paramet-
ric equilibrium as a function, i.e., mapping, of the
leaders’ strategies. Then, the blockchain provider
and the cyber-insurer form a noncooperative
game as a five-tuple GL ¼ f p>; �h

where

4 GAME EQUILIBRIUM ANALYSIS
Based on the formulation of the Stackelberg game in Section
3.3, we are ready to analyze the market equilibrium using
backward induction. We first obtain the Nash Equilibrium
(NE) of the user-level noncooperative subgame Gu by charac-
terizing a system of interdependent demands. We provide
the sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness
of the NE in the user-level noncooperative subgame Gu by
solving the bounded linear complementarity problem of the
subgame [33]. Then, we substitute the parametric NE of Gu
into the leader-level noncooperative subgame GL. Under a
reasonable assumption, we show that the Jacobian matrix
constructed from the payoff functions of each player in the
leader-level noncooperative subgame is negative definite.
Hence, we prove that the Stackelberg Equilibrium (SE) of the
market game exists and is unique.
4.1 Equilibrium Analysis for User-Level
Noncooperative Subgame
Intuitively, user i only buys the service when it has a posi-
tive payoff, namely ui > 0. This indicates that there exists
4. The reason that the users are in the same level, i.e., lower-level, is
that they have the same set of information and make decisions simulta-
neously. This is different from the blockchain provider that usually
invests in the infrastructure and buys the cyber-insurance first to
improve the security level of its blockchain-based service and then pro-
vides the service to the users. The cyber-insurer sells the cyber-insur-
ance to the blockchain provider and forms a noncooperative
relationship with the blockchain provider. As such, the cyber-insurer
and blockchain provider make their decisions simultaneously and
hence before the users. As a result, the blockchain provider and cyber-
insurer are considered to be the leaders and their problems are defined
in the upper-level.

where I is the identity matrix, 1 ¼ 1; 1; . . . ; 1½ �>2 R Nj j�1 and
�f gi represents the i-th entry of a vector. With (16), we are
ready to investigate the properties of the NE in the user-
level noncooperative subgame.
Assumption 1. ar Gð Þ < 1, where r �ð Þ is the spectral norm of a
matrix.
The physical meaning of Assumption 1 is illustrated in
Fig. 2, where the black area is the feasible area of ar Gð Þ. If
ar Gð Þ exceeds the feasible area, the social externality will
be too strong such that every user will buy the service,
which is impossible in reality.
Theorem 1. The user-level noncooperative subgame Gu admits a
unique NE under Assumption 1.
Proof. (16) is defined as a bounded linear complementarity
problem in [33]. It is a linear instance of the general mixed
complementarity problems discussed in [35]. As dis-
cussed in [35], the linear instance of a complementarity
problem admits a unique solution, i.e., the NE, to
the user-level noncooperative subgame Gu, if I� aGð Þ is a
P-matrix.5
Since ar Gð Þ < 1 under Assumption 1, all the eigen-
values of the matrix aG belong to 0; 1ð Þ and hence all
the eigenvalues of the matrix I� aGð Þ belong to 0; 1ð Þ.
Therefore, I� aGð Þ is a non-singular M-matrix.6
Based on Theorem 6.2.3 in [36], “any non-singular M-
matrix is a P-matrix”, I� aGð Þ is a P-matrix and then
there exists a unique NE in the user-level noncooperative
subgame Gu. Thereby, the proof is completed. tu
According to the system of interdependent demands
(16), the set of users N can be partitioned into three subsets,
i.e., S0, S1, and S as follows:
� S0 ¼ i 1þ �h
� �
1� p� I� aGð Þx �
i
< 0; 8i 2 N��n o
is the set of users which will not buy the blockchain
service,
� S1 ¼ i 1þ �h
� �
1� p� I� aGð Þx �
i
> 0; 8i 2 N��n o
is the set of users which surely will buy the block-
chain service,
� S ¼ Nn S0 [ S1ð Þ ¼ fijfð1þ �hÞ1� p� ðI� aGÞxgi ¼
0; 8i 2 Ng is the set of users which buy the block-
chain service with a probability over 0; 1½ �.
Then, we obtain the following theorem:
Theorem 2. The users in the user-level noncooperative subgame
Gu only belong to S, i.e., S ¼ N , S0 ¼ ;, and S1 ¼ ;. Given
the service price vector p, the optimal solution to the system of
interdependent demands (16) is

Proof. We denote the optimal price by p	 and the optimal

	 such that

ingly xi

price charged to user i decreases from pi
	 to pi
0,
user i has an incentive to increase its demand
from xi
	 ¼ 0 to xi
0 > 0. Consequently, the reve-
nue of the blockchain provider will increase since
pi
	xi
	 ¼ 0 while pi

	 and pi
	
cannot be the optimal demand and price for user
i, respectively. Hence, i =2 S0, 8i 2 N and S0 ¼ ;.
(2) S1 ¼ ;: Similarly, we assume that S1 6¼ ;. This
means that 9l 2 N , xl

user l belongs to S instead of S1. Therefore, pl

S1 ¼ ;.
To conclude, given any price vector p of the block-

4.2 Equilibrium Analysis for Leader-Level
Noncooperative Subgame
After deriving the equilibriumdemand of the users, we inves-
tigate the leader-level noncooperative subgame GL for the
blockchain provider and the cyber-insurer. At the NE, no
player can increase its profit by choosing a different strategy
provided that the other player’ strategy is unchanged [37].
In what follows, we first prove that anNE exists in the leader-
level noncooperative subgame GL. Then, we prove that this
NE is unique.
Substituting the optimal demand of the users derived in
(22) into the profit function of the blockchain provider, we
can rewrite (8) into a matrix form as follows:

The first-order partial derivative of the profit of block-
chain provider as well as that of the cyber-insurer are
shown in (24), and the second-order partial derivatives of
the blockchain provider and cyber-insurer are shown
in (25). Then, we can obtain the following theorem regard-
ing the NE of the leader-level noncooperative subgame.
Theorem 3. There exists at least one NE in the leader-level non-
cooperative subgame GL if and only if a > 1

Then, the Stackbelberg equilibrium of the market game exists.
Proof. Please refer to Appendix A,, which can be found
on the Computer Society Digital Library at http://doi.

in [38] for the proof. tu
Next, we show the uniqueness of the NE in the leader-
level noncooperative subgame in Theorem 4, and hence the
Stackbelberg equilibrium is unique.
Theorem 4. The NE in the leader-level noncooperative subgame
GL is unique if and only if a > 9 bþ1ð Þ2 guð Þbþ1

4.3 Equilibrium Searching for Leader-Level
Noncooperative Subgame
Since in our previous discussion we have provided the
closed-form NE to the user-level noncooperative subgame Gu
in (22), we only have to focus on the derivation of the NE in
the leader-level noncooperative subgame GL. Given (22), the
search for the SE is reduced to the search of the NE of a two-
player noncooperative game. By Theorem 3, we know that GL
is a concave game with the convex and compact strategy
space (see also the proof to Theorem 3). By Theorem 4, we
know that GL admits a unique NE when the condition given
therein is satisfied. This suggests the use of the iterative best
response to solve for the NE in GL. The iterative best-response
algorithm is described in Algorithm 1, and its convergence
property is guaranteed by Theorem 5.

librium in each stage. We consider a group of Nj j users in the
blockchain service market. The off-diagonal elements of social

we present in the figures of simulation results is the mean
value of the discriminatory prices. The triple integral in the
premium-related term in the profit functions of the blockchain
provider and the cyber-insurer, i.e., (8) and (9), is calculated
using the method of rectangular integral with 100 as the
number of intervals. Note that our proposed concept of cyber-
insurer and blockchain service is the first in the literature.
There is no similar work with which we can compare on
a reasonably fair basis. For example, the authors in [40] formu-
lated a bilevel game to investigate the interactions among the
attackers, users, and cyber-insurer in computer networks.
However, sincewe incorporate the specific andunique feature
of the blockchain technology, i.e., successful attack probability
in (1), reasonable comparison is therefore not applicable.
5.1 Numerical Results
5.1.1 Demonstration of Best Response and NE
Fig. 3 demonstrates the NE obtained from interative best
responses with the given simulation parameters. In Fig. 3a,
the profit of the cyber-insurer changes with the different
premium charged to the blockchain provider. According to
our previous discussion, the profit of the cyber-insurer
is controlled by the value of g. For a given weak level of the
social externality, e.g., a ¼ 6:5� 10�4, there is a correspond-
ing strategy where the cyber-insurer’s profit is maximized.

The strategy is marked by the arrowhead of “Best response”
and constitutes the NE strategy of the cyber-insurer under
the given social externality setting. We observe from Fig. 3a
that as a function of the premium coefficient g, the profit
is unimodal, and thus the optimal solution can be obtained
analytically. Similarly, there exists the optimal point in each
of Fig. 3b, 3c, and 3d for the blockchain provider. The
optimal points are marked by the arrowhead of “Best
response” and constitute the NE strategy of the blockchain
provider under different levels of social externality. Note
that all the results shown in the figures are obtained given
that the users play the NE in the user-level game.
Fig. 4 illustrates the equilibrium strategies for the invest-
ment of the blockchain provider and the premium coefficient
g for the cyber-insurer under different levels of social external-
ity. The NE is the point at which the best responses for the
blockchain provider and cyber-insurer intersect. Again, this
is given that the users play the NE in the user-level game.
Under different levels of social externality, different NE are
observed. As the level of social externality grows higher, i.e.,
a decision of one user has stronger effect to the decisions
of other users, the other users are more likely to buy the same
service if one user buys the service. As expected, when the
level of social externality grows higher, the users are more
likely to also buy the service, the blockchain provider
has more money and more incentives to invest in the infra-
structure and accordingly the premium coefficient g decreases
(see Fig. 4). The reason for this result is explained in the
subsequent discussions.
5.1.2 The Impact of the Number of Users
We first evaluate the impacts by the number of users on the
payoff of the market entities in Fig. 5, where the number
of users increases from 50 to 120. Then, we evaluate the
performance under three levels of social externality, e.g.,
6:5� 10�4, 7� 10�4, and 7:5� 10�4 which represent weak,
medium, and strong levels of social externality, respec-
tively. As expected, the profit of the blockchain provider
increases significantly when the social externality becomes
stronger. As the number of users increases, the profit of the
blockchain provider also increases under the given social
externality settings. Moreover, the increase of the profit
of the blockchain provider becomes larger when the social
externality is stronger. Intuitively, the reason is that the
social externality stimulates the demand of each user. In
return, the blockchain provider can raise the price of service
accordingly and hence improves its profit. Meanwhile, as the
social externality becomes stronger, the blockchain provider
also achieves greater profit. This indicates that the attack
may incur more loss to the blockchain provider. Therefore,
the blockchain provider has a higher incentive to invest in
the infrastructure to prevent double-spending attack. This
explains the result that the investment by the blockchain
provider increases at a higher rate with a ¼ 7:5� 10�4 than
with a ¼ 6:5� 10�4. As a result, the stronger social externality
reduces the successful attack probability at a higher rate.
Correspondingly, as shown in Fig. 5f, the premium coefficient
g decreases at a higher rate with the stronger social external-
ity. This result indicates that the premium also decreases at
a higher rate with stronger social externality. Thus, the cyber-
insurer’s profit decreases at a higher rate when the social
externality becomes stronger as shown in Fig. 5b.
5.1.3 The Impact of Social Externality
Fig. 6 illustrates the impact of social externality on the pay-
offs of the three market entities with 100 users. As expected,
the users’ total service demand increases as the social exter-
nality becomes stronger (see Fig. 6d). From Fig. 6a and 6b,
we observe that the profit of the blockchain provider
increases while the profit of the cyber-insurer decreases.
The reason is that the users with stronger social externality
are more sensitive to the security level of the blockchain
service, and the security level depends on the investment
ratio of the blockchain provider. Therefore, the blockchain
provider will raise its investment as the social externality
increases, which decreases the probability of successful
double-spending attacks. Accordingly, the cyber-insurer
reduces its premium as shown in Fig. 6f, and this will lead
to the decrease of the cyber-insurer’s profit. Moreover, since
the investment by the blockchain provider increases, the
security level of the blockchain service is improved, and
thus the service demand of users increases. This situation
results in the increase of the blockchain provider’s profit.
Additionally, recall that the investment ratio of the block-
chain provider depends on not only the investment from the
blockchain provider, but also the computing resource owned
by the attackers. For this reason, in our performance evalua-
tion, we also vary the attacker’s investment in computing
resource by considering three cases with a ¼ 50, a ¼ 100 and
a ¼ 150, respectively. From Fig. 6f, we observe that the
decreasing rate of the curves becomes higher as the attacker’s
investment increases, which means that decreasing rate of
the premium becomes higher as the attacker’s investment

increases. The reason is that the increasing rate of the invest-
ment by the blockchain provider becomes faster as the
attacker’s investment increases, and this also results in a
higher decreasing rate of the successful attack probability.
Consequently, the decreasing rate of the probability of paying
claim is the highest with a ¼ 150 which is the largest
attacker’s investment.
5.1.4 The Impact of Attacker’s Computing Resource
Finally, we evaluate in Fig. 7 the impact of the attackers’
computing resource on the performance of the users, the
blockchain provider and the cyber-insurer. We consider
three different situations with different sizes of a block, i.e.,
the number of transactions included in that block, with
NT ¼ 100, NT ¼ 200 and NT ¼ 300. We observe from Fig. 7a
and 7b that as the attacker’s computing resource increases,
the profit of the blockchain provider decreases and the
profit of the cyber-insurer remains unchanged. The reason
is that the blockchain provider needs to increase its infra-
structure investment when the attacker’s computing
resource increases (see Fig. 7e). Otherwise, the successful
attack probability will significantly increase, and it results
in the increase in the cost of the blockchain provider. With
an increasing computing resource controlled by the attack-
ers, the investment ratio of the blockchain provider cannot
remain as high as before. This result is illustrated in Fig. 7e
with h

a¼100

13 when NT ¼ 300. There-
fore, as the attackers’ computing resource increases, the
successful attack probability and consequently the probabil-
ity of the cyber-insurer paying the claim increases accord-
ingly. Then, as shown in Fig. 7f, the cyber-insurer increases
the premium to keep its profit unchanged. Ultimately, the
cost of the blockchain provider also increases. Moreover,
as the attackers’ computing resource increases, even when
the blockchain provider reduces the price of its service to
attract more users, the total demand from the users still
decreases (see Fig. 7c and 7d). Consequently, this reduces
the revenue and profit of the blockchain provider.
Furthermore, we show that the impact of the attackers’
computing resource on the other parties in the market is
subject to the number of transactions in one block NT.
With the fixed transaction fee and compensation rate, the
more transactions in a single block is, the more reward
that the blockchain provider obtains from mining a block.
Moreover, since the compensation price of one block
increases as the number of transactions in one block
increases, the more compensation it will pay to the users
once the attacks happen. Then, the blockchain provider
has more incentive to invest in the computing resource.
This is consistent with Fig. 7e, where the increasing rate
of the investment by the blockchain provider is higher
with NT ¼ 300 than that with NT ¼ 100. On the other
hand, as the attacker’s computing resource increases, the
increasing rate of the successful attack probability is
lower with NT ¼ 300 than that with NT ¼ 100. Conse-
quently, the increasing rate of the premium is lower with
NT ¼ 300 than that with NT ¼ 100 (see Fig. 7f). Moreover,
as NT increases, the increasing rate of the successful
attack probability will decrease, and the users’ demand
will be less affected. This is consistent with Fig. 7c
and 7d, where the decreasing rates of both the total user
demand and the service price shrink as NT increases.
6 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed a risk management frame-
work of the blockchain service market by introducing the
cyber-insurance as a mean for protecting financially the
blockchain provider from double-spending attacks. We
have modeled the interaction among the blockchain pro-
vider, the cyber-insurer and the users in the market as a
two-stage Stackelberg game. For the blockchain provider,
we have considered the problem of balancing between the
proactive protection strategy, i.e., investing in computing
power, and the reactive protection strategy, i.e., purchasing
the cyber-insurance. For the users, we have considered the
impact of both the social externality and the service security
on the users’ valuation of the blockchain service. InFig. 7. The result with increasing attacker’s computing resource.

particular, for the cyber-insurer, we have incorporated the
risk-adjusted pricing mechanism for premium adaptation.
We have studied the equilibrium strategies of the three par-
ties in the market using backward induction. We have ana-
lytically examined the conditions for the Stackelberg game
to exist and to be unique. Furthermore, we have conducted
extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of the
market entities at the equilibrium. For the future work, we
will investigate the long-run competition between the block-
chain provider and cyber-insurer.
