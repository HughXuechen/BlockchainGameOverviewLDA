Abstract—In order to further promote the construction of 
power market, it is necessary to analyze the transaction mode of 
fair competition in the spot market. This paper proposes a leader-
follower game model of power transaction based on blockchain, 
analyzes and solves the Nash equilibrium state in the game. This 
paper analyzes the impact of the application degree of block chain 
on the income of participants in the power market, and allocates 
the income of the supply side through the cooperative game of 
power suppliers. The simulation results show that the application 
of blockchain is conductive to building an open and transparent 
market environment, promoting power trading and resource 
consumption, and optimizing the target revenue on both sides of 
supply and demand. At the same time, the cooperative game 
between power suppliers can increase the profits of the supply 
side, ensure the reasonable distribution of the interests of the 
supply side. 
Keywords—electricity trading, blockchain; master slave game; 
cooperative game 
I. INTRODUCTION 
With the expansion of electric energy trading scale and the 
increase of people's demand for electric energy, the economic 
conflict between power suppliers and users under the condition 
of power market has become an urgent problem to be studied[1]. 
In the open power market, participants will adopt different 
strategies to maximize their own benefits under the condition of 
market permission. Among them, the goal of power producers 
is to maximize their own income through power price 
competition[2][3]; The goal of users is to minimize the power 
purchase cost on the premise of ensuring that their load demand 
is met. In the process of constructing the overall architecture of 
power trading system, it is necessary to consider the conflict of 
interest between participants. For such problems, game theory 
has become one of the effective tools to analyze the behavior of 
power market participants[4][5].  
Paper [6] constructed a clearing model of power market 
based on double-layer game to simulate the decision-making 
process of participants and evaluate the market mechanism. 
Paper [7] studies the end-to-end power trading method based on 
cooperative game, and uses shapely value theory to distribute 
the income according to the contribution of participants. Based 
on the leader-follower game theory. The traditional research on 
the game method of power trading is limited to the centralized 
way of trading, and there are barriers between trading 
information and it can’t be managed effectively. 
Considering that the centrally stored data has the risk of 
being tampered with[8], and opening up a broader development 
space for the power grid, this paper applies the blockchain 
technology[9] to the game between power suppliers and users. 
Firstly, the interaction model between power suppliers and users 
is constructed based on the blockchain trading platform; Further, 
through the objective function of each participant in the power 
market, this paper optimize the participant strategy; Then, it 
analyzes the power suppliers with different game modes; Finally, 
the scheme is verified by data simulation.

Fig. 1. Interactive structure of power market based on blockchain 
The participants in the blockchain based power market 
include power suppliers and users, and the technologies such as 
smart contract of the blockchain trading platform ensure the 
"decentralization" in the trading process. As the main players of 
the game, the power supplier and the user realize the information 
interaction in the game through the blockchain trading platform. 
Power suppliers can adopt the strategy of non-cooperative game, 
directly trade with users through the blockchain trading platform, 
or embed it into the power supply side through cooperative game, 
trade power with the demand side, and participate in the 
distribution of benefits on the supply side. Users can feed back

platform and conduct power trading. 
III. CONSTRUCTION OF GAME MODEL BASED ON 
BLOCKCHAIN 
A. Game model of power supplier 
This paper makes the following assumptions about the 
subjects participating in Power Trading: there are M  power 
suppliers on the supply side, m  is the number of the power 
supplier, and [1, ]m M∈ ; There are N  users on the demand 
side. n  is the number of the user, and [1, ]n N∈ ; The electric 
energy trading cycle between the power supplier and the user is 
divided into T  periods, t  is the serial number of the trading 
period, and [1, ]t T∈ ; ,
t
m nD  represents the electricity purchased 
by the user n  from the power supplier m  in the time period t . 
The electricity provided by the power supplier m  to all users is 
,
1n
t
m n
N
D

 , and the time-sharing pricing of electric energy is 
carried out. The price of electric energy in period t  is 
t
mp , and 
the power purchase cost of user n  in period t  is 
1
,
t
M
t
m m n
m
p D
=
 . 
In the pricing process, the power supplier can ensure the 
balance between supply and demand of electric energy by 
adjusting the price. The satisfaction function ( , )CSI Q D  in t  
period is mainly determined by power supply m
Q  and user 
demand 
,
1n
t
m n
N
D
=
 . If the supply-demand relationship of electric 
energy in t  period shows that the supply exceeds the demand, 
the power supplier will price lower than the benchmark price 
0
t
mp  in this period, and reduce the electric energy supply in the 
next stage. On the contrary, the power supplier can set the 
electricity price higher than the benchmark price 0
t
mp  in this 
period for trading, and increase the electricity supply in the next 
stage. The satisfaction function ( , )CSI Q D  can be expressed as: 
 
,

( )( , ) t t
N
n
m n mCSI Q D D Qω

where 0ω >  is the parameter that acts on the supply-demand 
relationship. 
According to the relevant definitions of satisfaction 
function, the regulating effect on the power price 
t
mp  
formulated by power supplier m  is as follow[10]: 
 0 ( , )t t
m mp CSIp Q D= +  (2) 
where 
0
t
mp  is the benchmark electric energy price under the 
balance of supply and demand. 
With the help of the workload proof mechanism and equity 
proof mechanism of blockchain technology, the supply side 
takes the carbon emissions of power suppliers in the trading 
market as the credit carrier to participate in the competition for 
bookkeeping rights and share the carbon emission costs in the 
game process. The corresponding environmental cost t
eC  is：

t
e m
M
m
t
C f Q

where f  is the environmental cost coefficient of carbon 
emission and other negative effects caused by unit power 
generation. 
Assuming that the power generation cost t
gC  of power 
supplier m  is a quadratic function of power generation 
capacity t
mQ , the power generation cost t
gC  is:

Blockchain technology can avoid fraud and counterfeiting 
in the traditional capital market and reduce some decision-
making cost d
C  of power suppliers. The higher the application 
degree of blockchain, the lower the decision-making cost of 
power suppliers, which can be expressed as: 
 0(1 )t t
d dC q C= −  (5) 
where 0
t
dC  is the initial decision-making cost of the power 
supplier in the game process. 
Regardless of the power trading between power suppliers, 
the power supplier only trades with users, and the power sales 
revenue t
sE  on the supply side is the total power sales revenue 
of the power supplier:

The total cost

the decision-making cost

the power supplier is as follow:

On the power supply side, the power supplier aims to 
minimize the difference a between cost and income

based on TOU price. 
B. Game model of power user 
The utility function ,
t

by the power consumption ,
t
m nD  and the preference ,
t
m nω  of 
using power supplier m  to supply power. The utility function 
is as follows:

C. Game interaction model 
The game process between power suppliers and users in the 
game process is shown in Fig. 2. 
1) Set the application degree of blockchain and the initial 
power price of power supplier. 
2) Judge the strategic nature of the power supplier on the 
supply side. If cooperative game is adopted, the power supplier 
will participate in the benefit distribution on the supply side. If 
the non cooperative game is adopted, the power supplier will 
directly obtain the benefits of trading with users. 
3) Users adjust their electricity consumption according to 
the electricity price set by the power supplier, and the power 
supplier adjusts its own electricity price to maximize its 
interests. The two constitute a leader-follower game. 
4) The power suppliers and the users repeat steps 2 to 3 to 
compare whether the strategies of the participants before and 
after the game have changed. When the Nash equilibrium is 
reached, the participants' strategies will not change, and solve 
the optimal strategy set on the supply side and the demand side.

The benchmark price is set as the time of use price of the 
power grid for different periods. Refer to the peak and valley 
price of industrial power implemented by Jiangsu Province 
from January 1, 2021. The specific data of the benchmark price

In the power market based on blockchain technology, users 
can have a clearer understanding of the information of power 
suppliers, and can establish a more perfect trust mechanism 
based on smart contract and other technologies in the 
transaction process. This paper selects the user benchmark load 
under different application levels of blockchain ( 0.2q = ,
0.8q = ), as shown in Fig. 3.

Fig. 6. Revenue structure of power suppliers when the application level of 
blockchain is high 
The decision-making cost of power suppliers with high 
application degree of blockchain will be reduced. From 0:00 to 
8:00 in the electricity price Valley, the electricity demand of 
users and the benchmark electricity price are low. The income 
of power suppliers in the valley is low. During the peak period 
of electricity price from 8:00 to 12:00 and from 17:00 to 21:00, 
the electricity demand of users increases significantly, and the 
benchmark electricity price in this period is high. The trading 
electricity of suppliers in this period increases, and the income 
from electricity sales increases. Considering the environmental 
cost, power generation cost and decision-making cost, the total 
income of power suppliers increases. 
 
Fig. 7. User payment function and composition under different application 
degree of blockchain 
The user utility function, cost function and payment 
function under different blockchain application levels are 
shown in Figure 7. Users prefer power suppliers with high 
application degree of blockchain. The total profit of power 
suppliers increased from RMB 358100 to RMB373800. For 
users seeking to minimize the payment function, considering 
the user's transaction cost function and the utility function 
according to the change of power consumption, when the 
application degree of blockchain is increased from 0.2 to 0.8, 
the user's payment function is increased from RMB 615600 to 
RMB 616200, and the power consumption of a single user is 
increased from 26.07 kWh to 28.38 kWh. After the application 
degree of blockchain increases, the power consumption of users 
increases when the user payment function is basically 
unchanged. 
In this paper, Nash negotiation method is used to distribute 
the benefits of the power supply side. Based on different 
benchmark electricity prices in different periods, the income 
and power supply cost on the supply side are selected as shown 
in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6. The supply side revenue and expenditure 
in different periods are shown in Table II.

V. CONCLUSION 
Based on the blockchain, this paper establishes the leader-
follower game model between power suppliers and users, 
compares and analyzes the benefits of supply side and demand 
side under different application degrees of blockchain through 
simulation. In the power market, power suppliers and users use 
the leader-follower game to trade electric energy. The 
improvement of the application degree of blockchain can make 
the transaction process between the supplier and the demander 
transparent, improve the reliability of information in the 
transaction process, promote user consumption and increase the 
income of power supply side at the same time.
