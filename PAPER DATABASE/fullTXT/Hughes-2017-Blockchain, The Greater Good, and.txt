BLOCKCHAIN, THE GREATER GOOD, AND HUMAN AND
CIVIL RIGHTS

Abstract: The central theme of this paper is that the development of a technology
that is predicted to have a major impact on the way we transact with each other
should be a matter where the needs of society at large are taken into account. Where
the technology is one that emerges from the domain of the Internet, inclusivity
becomes even more acute in order to avoid widening the already existing gap in
reaping the “digital dividend.” With blockchain, the obligation could even be seen as
a moral one, as blockchain is said to have the potential to negate the scope for the
abuse of trust by states and institutions. This could be a game changer in areas such
as public procurement and the conduct of elections where abuse can lead to the
denial of essential resources and a concomitant loss of life, or to conflict and mass
killings. Blockchain presents an opportunity for the Internet development
community to claim a degree of recognition in the human rights realm by aiding civil
intervention in areas where military intervention has been deemed inappropriate.
Keywords: blockchain, human rights, inclusion, cyber access, digital divide,
anti-corruption, electoral processes, moral responsibility.
Introduction
Blockchain has been described as “one of the most fundamental inven-
tions in the history of computer science” and as being “at the heart of
the fourth industrial revolution” (Schwab 2016). It is seen as having the
potential to radically transform the way in which we live and transact
with each other because it solves the problem of trust in transacting
with third parties: “The formidable innovation introduced by this tech-
nology is that the network is open and participants do not need to
know or trust each other to interact: the electronic transactions can be
automatically verified and recorded by the nodes of the network
through cryptographic algorithms, without human intervention, central
authority, point of control or third party (e.g. governments, banks,
financial institutions or other organizations)” (Atzori 2015, 2).
The issue raised in this paper is that blockchain may have a contri-
bution to make towards the improvement of services for the wider
community and in the protection of human rights and that while there
are a number of blockchain developments aimed at the welfare of the

vulnerable, progress in this area would benefit from a more structured
approach.1
In less than a generation the Internet has demonstrated its potential to
improve the lives of billions of individuals and accelerate the economic
development of countries. Billions remain offline, however, and the “digital
divide” could result in significant numbers of the global population being
omitted from the benefits that the Internet brings. McKinsey and Co. high-
lighted this concern in its August 2014 report on Internet access: “This is
an issue for all of us. The voices, ideas, and contributions of the offline
population can�t be heard and often can�t be made until they�re connected.
It is therefore crucial to identify and aggressively pursue opportunities to
make the Internet accessible to all.” McKinsey reported that nearly 4.5 bil-
lion people were offline (meaning that only 43 percent of the world�s popu-
lation had regular access to the Internet). McKinsey further reported that
in the world�s poorest countries, only one in ten people was online, that
3.5 billion of the offline lived in just twenty countries, that nearly one bil-
lion of those 3.5 billion were illiterate, and that between 1.1 billion and 2.8
billion individuals could not get online via a mobile network because they
did not live within an area with network coverage. The concern is whether,
if left to its own devices, blockchain will spontaneously do things that
might be for the greater good (including the good of the offline billions) or
whether it will simply develop in the more commercial and lucrative direc-
tion that its investors and developers are (understandably) likely to pursue.
As one of blockchain�s key features is its ability to negate the potential for
the abuse of power through the exploitation of dependency and trust rela-
tionships, we could usefully explore its potential to disrupt abuse by gov-
ernments engaged in corrupt practices and human rights abuses.
The related question of whether or not Internet access is itself a basic
human right has been the subject of U.N. review in recent years. Follow-
ing developments in Estonia, France, Costa Rica, and Finland that leant
towards recognition of a right of access, the U.N.�s Special Rapporteur
reported in June 2011 that the Internet had become “an indispensable
tool for realizing a range of human rights, combating inequality, and
accelerating development and human progress.”2 On 1 July 2016, the
U.N. passed a Resolution that (amongst other things) affirmed “the

importance of applying a comprehensive human rights-based approach in
providing and in expanding access to [the] Internet” and requested that
“all States make efforts to bridge the many forms of digital divides.”3
This was reported, slightly inaccurately, by the press as the U.N. having
resolved that access to the Internet is to be considered a basic human
right.4 In response to these developments at the U.N. an extremely impor-
tant point was made in an article by Vint Cerf in the New York Times:
[P]hilosophical arguments [over whether Internet access is a human right, a
civil right, or neither] overlook a more fundamental issue: the responsibility of
technology creators themselves to support human and civil rights. The Internet
has introduced an enormously accessible and egalitarian platform for creat-
ing, sharing and obtaining information on a global scale. As a result, we
have new ways to allow people to exercise their human and civil rights. . . .
As we seek to advance the state of the art in technology and its use in
society, we must be conscious of our civil responsibilities in addition to our
engineering expertise. . . . Improving the Internet is just one means, albeit an
important one, by which to improve the human condition. It must be done
with an appreciation for the civil and human rights that deserve protection.5
The proposition that technology creators have a responsibility to support
human and civil rights is the very same point advocated in this article.
The idea isn�t new. The Human Rights Center at the University of Cali-
fornia at Berkeley, for instance, has been developing initiatives in this
area for more than twenty years and has pioneered innovation in the use
of technology in the exhumation of mass graves, for example.6
If blockchain is unlikely, in the absence of a conscious effort, to
develop capability in an area of such fundamental importance as the
protection of human rights then we need to consider how the necessary
stimulus is to be provided. As a counterpoint, it has to be recognised
that blockchain technology, like the Internet or any other technology, is
to some extent neutral, and can be used by malicious agents, such as
corrupt governments, as well good agents to realize their outcomes.

Furthermore, there is regulatory risk to blockchain technology being
outlawed or regulated by governments, particularly corrupt ones. These
concerns make the need for action by those with an interest in prevent-
ing human rights and other abuses even more important.
Policy, Priorities, Inclusivity and Coordination
If blockchain is really going to change things as radically as is being
predicted then we need to consider whether it can be used to develop
systems, tools, and techniques that further the principles of freedom,
justice, and peace in the world, and that champion human rights and
the rule of law.
Advances in drone technology and mobile phone communications
have led to improved access to services, humanitarian relief, the preser-
vation of the environment in regions where medicines are delivered to
remote areas, telemedicine, and the surveying and mapping of land to
prevent illegal mining and the contamination of water bodies. If these
technologies that were not heralded with quite as much fanfare can do
so much to help alleviate suffering and to protect and preserve rights
and resources, could blockchain have similar impacts or even greater
ones if channelled effectively?
While the potential of blockchain to impact accountability and
transparency in government has already received some attention from
developers, the trend would appear to be towards the development of
new, more streamlined, less costly end-user-controlled products and
services to compete with products traditionally offered by banks and
the financial services sector, and the development of commercially
more advantageous schemes for coalface workers (e.g. music industry
rights claims and improving conditions for workers in cyber-enabled
businesses, such as Airbnb and Uber [Tapscott 2016]). These develop-
ments, though welcome, are clearly not priorities for the poor and vul-
nerable in developing countries.
When it comes to determining what the critical issues for cyber-
excluded or low-resource communities are, what the priority areas for
action should be, what the strategies for implementation and the role
of those there on the ground should be, inclusion becomes vital. Diver-
gent views will emerge. For example, the scope for electoral fraud in
wealthy, industrialised nations is in the main much less than in poorer
countries and vote-rigging on the basis of an absence of records is gen-
erally much more difficult. As a consequence an interest in directing
blockchain or digital development in this area may not be seen as hav-
ing the same degree of urgency. As Andreas Antonopoulos once
remarked in an interview, “In terms of voting, the real question is what
problem are you trying to solve, which is often the case when geeks

come into politics? What problem are you trying to solve with voting:
verifying the integrity of the vote? We don�t really have a voting fraud
problem, at least not to [sic] the United States” (Frauenfelder 2016).
Another concern about developing blockchain�s humanitarian
potential is the lack of direction and coordination. The absence of cen-
tral control has been a badge of pride for cyber citizens from the early
beginnings of the public Internet (Barlow 1996). Indeed, the Internet
Society has argued that the historic and future success of the Internet
as an open and trusted platform for innovation and empowerment
depends on a decentralized, collaborative, and multi-stakeholder ap-
proach to governance. It argues that the decentralized and community-
driven management approach of the Internet is what has enabled its
growth and innovation.
A recent report by the Global Commission on Internet Governance
argued, however, that “Internet governance is one of the most pressing
global public policy issues of our time” and helpfully proceeded to set out
three possible future scenarios for the Internet (GCIG 2016). In the worst-
case scenario the Internet collapses for a number of reasons. The second
scenario is one of stunted growth where some users capture a dispropor-
tionate share of “digital dividends” while others are permanently locked
out, and a world of digital haves and have-nots results. In the third sce-
nario, the Internet is “energetic, vigorous and healthy,” producing unprece-
dented opportunities for access to information and knowledge, growth,
development, and innovation. As the report says, the third scenario is the
scenario to which most of the world aspires, but “[r]ealizing this future
requires concrete actions to ensure that the Internet will be open, secure,
trustworthy and inclusive of everyone.” The fact that the report specifically
places an emphasis on social justice and human rights as a feature of the
third scenario and that it recognises the need for direction and focus to
steer developments in that direction is extremely encouraging.
Corruption and Electoral Fraud
One of the root causes of suffering in developing countries is govern-
ments that fail to fulfil their sovereign responsibility to protect their
populations from harm.7
7 The Responsibility to Protect, Report of the International Commission on Interven-
tion and State Sovereignty, December 2001, at paragraph 1.35: “It is acknowledged that
sovereignty implies a dual responsibility: externally—to respect the sovereignty of other
states, and internally, to respect the dignity and basic rights of all the people within the
state. In international human rights covenants, in UN practice, and in state practice itself,
sovereignty is now [to] be understood as embracing this dual responsibility. Sovereignty
as responsibility has become the minimum content of good international citizenship.” At

http://responsibilitytoprotect.org/ICISS%20Report.pdf
The doctrine of the Responsibility to Protect was developed by the
U.N. over the past two decades, following the atrocities in Somalia
(1993), Rwanda (1994), Bosnia (1995), and Kosovo (1999). The doc-
trine provides justification for intervention by U.N. member states in
the affairs of a sovereign state where the state fails in its duty to pro-
tect its own citizens and engages in “atrocity crimes.” While sanctions
and other soft measures are not entirely excluded, the doctrine is pri-
marily concerned with military intervention: “The emerging principle in
question is that intervention for human protection purposes, including
military intervention in extreme cases, is supportable when major harm
to civilians is occurring or imminently apprehended, and the state in
question is unable or unwilling to end the harm, or is itself the
perpetrator.”8
Heads of State and Government at the 2005 World Summit deliber-
ately limited the scope of the Responsibility to Protect to the four
crimes of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and crimes against
humanity (“atrocity crimes” or “mass atrocity crimes”) (U.N. 2005).
The Secretary-General�s 2009 Report on Implementing the Responsibil-
ity to Protect explained: “The responsibility to protect applies, until
Member States decide otherwise, only to the four specified crimes and
violations: genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against
humanity. . . . To try to extend it to cover other calamities, such as
HIV/AIDS, climate change or the response to natural disasters, would
undermine the 2005 consensus and stretch the concept beyond recogni-
tion or operational utility” (U.N. 2009, 8). Accordingly, economic
crimes (as well as “calamities, such as HIV/AIDS”), invariably the
precursors to atrocity crimes, were excluded from the ambit of the
doctrine. Given that the failure of leadership and government are at
the heart of both atrocity crimes and economic crimes, the only possi-
ble justification for intervention in one but not the other is that there is
no (immediate) violence or bloodshed in the case of economic crimes.
The cost of economic crimes in money and lives, however, is argu-
ably higher than that associated with atrocity crimes. Africa alone is
8 The Responsibility to Protect, Report of the International Commission on Interven-
tion and State Sovereignty, December 2001, at paragraph 2.25. Paragraph 4.19 reads:
In the Commission�s view, military intervention for human protection purposes is
justified in two broad sets of circumstances, namely in order to halt or avert:
• large scale loss of life, actual or apprehended, with genocidal intent or not,
which is the product either of deliberate state action, or state neglect or inability
to act, or a failed state situation; or
• large scale “ethnic cleansing,” actual or apprehended, whether carried out by
killing, forced expulsion, acts of terror or rape.
If either or both of these conditions are satisfied, it is our view that the “just cause”
component of the decision to intervene is amply satisfied.

estimated to be losing more than $50 billion annually in illicit outward
financial flows, per the United Nations Economic Commission for
Africa (UNECA 2016, 78). The ONE Campaign estimates that at least
$1 trillion is being taken out of the budgets of developing countries
each year through a web of corrupt activity and suggests that the vast
sums being diverted are preventing some countries from financing their
fight against extreme poverty, disease, and hunger. In the ONE
Campaign�s assessment, a combined total of 7.9 million deaths per
annum in low-income and lower-middle-income countries in the decade
to 2025 could be prevented if these diverted revenues were instead
properly invested in the health systems of those countries (Hector
2014). By way of comparison, in 2015 somewhere in the region of fifty-
five thousand people were killed in the on-going Syrian war, including
twenty-one thousand civilians. The total number of deaths in the five
years of that conflict stood at around two hundred and fifty thousand
by the end of that year (Deutsche Welle 2016).
As economic crimes will not lead to intervention by the U.N. under
the doctrine of the Responsibility to Protect, other actors who have the
potential to restrain abuse in this area could usefully step in. Given
that a breach of trust lies at the heart of economic crimes and given
that the key feature of blockchain is its decentralized approach to
achieving consensus and trust through a proof-of-work consensus algo-
rithm, blockchain technology could be an important factor in plugging
the intervention gap left behind by the U.N. in its implementation of
the doctrine of the Responsibility to Protect by adding a new cyber
weapon to the fight against corruption and other economic crimes and
holding offending states to account. In so doing, the axiological nature
of blockchain is put in play.
Electoral processes can lead to conflict and killings when they are
perceived as not having been conducted in a free and fair manner
(UNDP 2009, 7). The scope for election rigging is high in poorer coun-
tries, which, typically, have a one-party state or two parties splitting
voters in a 50:50 “winner takes all” electoral environment.
Registers of births and deaths are often not robust or reliable for a
variety of reasons. Records may only go back a few decades, meaning
that many adults do not have birth certificates. Death certificates are
seldom obtained, and the necessary (manual) entries in registers are
not made, leading to a preponderance of ghost voters. Likewise, and
for the same reasons, there is a preponderance of underage voters.
Problems with the accuracy of I.D. systems means that bussing rogue
voters in from neighbouring countries for registration and voting can
and does occur, especially where colonial borders cut through ethnic
groups and border crossers can swell the votes for a particular candi-
date. In a nutshell, the outcome of an election can be heavily influenced

(if not pretty much predetermined) by the absence of a credible voters�
register at the outset.
As with economic crimes, the question is whether, given that a
breach of trust lies at the heart of electoral fraud, blockchain could
help address the problem of electoral fraud and the conflict and vio-
lence that can sometimes follow, and whether tightening up electoral
processes is another candidate for concerted blockchain developer
action. If so, once again, blockchain�s axiology is put in play.
Admittedly, work is already under way in the field of identity, identi-
fication, and digital democracy. Advances, however, need to be more
carefully planned and coordinated. In Code: And Other Laws of Cyber-
space, Version 2.0, Lawrence Lessig discusses the Microsoft-led project
to develop an Identity Metasystem (an Identity Layer) on the Internet.
While he welcomes the development and takes the view that it will give
users the ability to control precisely what data is revealed to those who
demand data about them, he raises a sinister point:
Individuals right now can be effectively anonymous on the Net. A plat-
form for authenticated identity would make anonymity much harder. We
might imagine, for example, a norm developing to block access to a website
by anyone not carrying a token that at least made it possible to trace back
to the user – a kind of driver�s license for the Internet. That norm, plus this
technology, would make anonymous speech extremely difficult. . . .
In the Internet�s first life, encryption technology was on the side of pri-
vacy. Its most common use was to keep information secret. But in the Inter-
net�s next life, encryption technology�s most important role will be in
making the Net more regulable. As an Identity Layer gets built into the
Net, the easy ability to demand some form of identity as a condition to
accessing the resources of the Net increases. (Lessig 2006, 52, 54)
And Ehud Shapiro argues:
. . . . . . . Internet technology today does not support the right of assembly,
and therefore it cannot and does not support democracy. The reason is that
even though we can easily form groups on Google, Facebook, you name it,
we don�t know who the people on [sic] the group are. A person [may not] be
the person he says he is, or may be multiple personae [or] really fakes oper-
ated by the same person.
Fortunately, help is on its way. The United Nations and the World Bank
have a goal to deploy electronic identities for all of humanity by 2030. With
electronic identities, one can easily verify the person who is on the Internet
and have confirmed identity, and therefore eventually support the freedom
of assembly on the Internet. And then following it, we will also hopefully be
able to form Internet democracy. (2016)
The prospect of cyber identification being a prerequisite to exercising
your right to vote may not be that attractive a prospect to those living

Conclusion
This paper queries whether blockchain developers should be encour-
aged to consider the role that blockchain could play in holding failing
governments to account and in protecting the persecuted and the
oppressed in addition to developing applications for the better conduct
of commerce and the more efficient delivery of government and munici-
pal services.
Atzori argues that while blockchain technology has the potential to
allow individuals and communities to redesign their interactions in pol-
itics, business, and society at large, with an unprecedented degree of
disintermediation through the use of automated, trustless transactions,
the traditional functions of the state cannot be substituted with
blockchain-based services. Her view is that the state is a necessary
central point of coordination in society:
Admittedly, the blockchain technology can greatly improve structure, man-
agement and decision making process of specific realities, making them less
dependable on top-down coordination. Yet, decentralization is not always
the best choice for all organizations and there are limits to what blockchains
are suited for. In particular, algorithms and binary codes are not meant for
policy-making, since politics is an art that stems from the ethic sphere of
human beings and it belongs to them exclusively, as creatures “endowed
with reason and conscience.” (Atzori 2015, 22)
It may indeed be the case (for the time being at least) that in matters
of policy, reason, and conscience (such as human rights abuses) compu-
tational technologies are no substitute for human endeavour. That
should not, however, stop us exploring whether blockchain technology
could help with holding the state accountable and with interventions
where the state is failing in its responsibilities, after the application of
reason and conscience. The challenge posed is whether we choose to
direct some of the blockchain initiative to flow uphill to the pool of
humanitarian protection or whether we simply choose to allow it to
develop in the absence of a policy drive directed at preventing abuse.
Technology and human rights is a vibrant and complicated area
spanning a number of fundamental aspects of global culture, including
governance of the Internet itself, disrupting the position of powerful
corporations and vested interests, impacting the role of powerful
institutions such as the U.N. in the human rights sphere, interfering
with the sovereignty of nation states, raising concerns about personal

and global security, cyberwars and terrorism on the Internet, the use
and protection of personal data, and matters of life and death in
conflict situations.
But the U.N. has determined that intervention in the affairs of
member states where states are failing to abide by their obligations will
only take place in the event of the perpetration of atrocity crimes and
will be military in nature. This leaves a huge intervention gap where
civil action might be more effective and where violence or even death
may result indirectly from the actions of a state, and blockchain might
just be in a position to help plug this gap. Ironically, blockchain didn�t
even get a mention in the top-ten world changers in the McKinsey
report of May 2013.
Blockchain has a potentially important role to play in the future
protection of human rights, and developers with an interest in this area
should identify two or three areas where blockchain�s potential is most
promising and work on developing tools in those areas in conjunction
with affected communities and their advocacy organisations. Pilot ini-
tiatives may include the two areas identified in this paper (economic
crimes and election fraud).
Progress will require the acceptance of a responsibility towards those
who are at the mercy of bad government and are at the same time
likely to be excluded from the “fourth industrial revolution.” It will
also require a commitment to inclusiveness in devising strategies to
hold the powerful to account and direction to enable the development
of blockchain tools and organisations aimed at countering the worst
forms of exploitation and abuse, thereby giving blockchain an axiology
that it would otherwise lack.
