is defined by incorporating a coalition model between all
sellers. In other words, all sellers form a coalition and a single
representative of them, takes part in the market and since [7]
has proved that, the core of such a game for all sellers is
non-empty, we can safely assume that, there won’t be any
other sellers outside the coalition. We will loosely use the
term aggregator for this representative.
On the other hand, the buyers, each participate in the market
separately and propose their prices. The buyer with the highest
price, wins that round and gets to buy electricity. We know that
in local markets the average prosumers (Producer/Consumer)
do not possess the necessary time, expertise and incentive to
form such a market. This is our another motivation to apply
Blockchains and smart contracts in our work. Blockchains are
decentralized networks of agents, each of which occupying a
certain node on the network with a specific address, resources
and capital [8]. All events on the Blockchain are certified
by all parties, which eliminates the possibility of fraud and
ensure the security of the electricity trading. Furthermore, all
the financial transactions, taking place on the Blockchain use
pre-defined and accepted smart contracts. Smart contracts are
the protocols that facilitate, verify and implement the contexts
of a contract. Smart contracts use the reasoning and structure
of normal contracts and furthermore enable the rulings of
the contract to be implemented, according to its terms with
minimal human intervention [9].
In this paper, we implement our P2P electricity marketing
mechanism, by defining a smart contract on the Ethereum
Blockchain and thus utilizing a well-defined auction. The
smart contract is defined based on the aforementioned contract
in certain pre-determined time windows, and it is written
in Solidity programming language. In the simulations, the
generation model for the sellers is simulated based on the
model of SunPower SPR-305E Photovoltaic (PV) panel from
the Simulink Simscape package. The whole platform is tested
on the TestRPC test Blockchain and the interactive platform
is finalized using Truffle API. In section II, we will introduce
the general structure of the grid and implemented network.
In section III, the mathematical model of the coalition game
will be introduced and section IV will present a case study of
the market and the general conclusions will be presented in
section V.
II. BLOCKCHAIN-BASED PEER-TO-PEER ENERGY
TRADING
A. Peer-To-Peer Marketing Modeling
In our proposed mechanism, each residential consumer is
equipped with distributed generation units (PV Panels) and
smart meters which simultaneously monitor, record and trans-
mit its generation and consumption levels to the smart contract.
The microgrid of the said prosumers is connected to the main
grid with a singular Point of Common Coupling (PCC). In our
model, the main grid is able to provide the necessary power
supply to the local grid whenever the local generation is not
sufficient to meet the demand or purchase the extra generation
from the local grids. The energy trading between the main grid
and the local grids is realized between the operator of the main
grid and the aggregators of the local grids. Obviously, the main
grid price for sellers should be designed lower than the local
price and the for the buyers should be higher than the local
prices to incentivize both buyers and sellers to trade inside
the local market. The architecture of the model can be seen
in Fig.1. The rules defined in Fig. 1 are applied using JSON

platform of the prosumers’ priorities into our decentralized
system.
B. Blockchain-Based Mechanism
As stated earlier, each of the prosumers, also occupies an
account on the Ethereum Blockchain with a specific address,
and an array of specific characteristics. At each time iteration,
all prosumers who want to sell their excessive generation
form a coalition to sell their generation in a unified set to
maximize their profit. For simplicity, the profit allocation
for each individual seller is proportional to the amount of
generation that they contribute to the coalition. The buyers
on the other hand are completely unaware of each others’
decisions and take part in a multiple-stage non-cooperative
auction for the available resources at each iteration. The users
are given option of adjusting their own demand to support
the market in various levels and the result and every single
action in the auction happens without the human interaction.
The link between the buyers and the sellers aggregator, is the

smart contract. There are five essential functions for a smart
contract are: (1) Dictating and announcing the start of each
iteration of the auction. (2) Receiving the current available
resources from the seller coalition and announcing it to the
buyers. (3) Waiting until a certain time or until all of the
bids of all buyers are received (whichever happens earlier). (4)
Comparing all of the buyers’ bids, finding and announcing the
winner. (5) Finally, transferring the appropriate funds form the
account of the winner to the seller coalition. These tasks are
done completely autonomous without any third-party oversight
and since all of data can be seen publicly (After all bids are
announced by the bidders or after the time of that iterations
auction passes), there can be no data incest or fraud. The
algorithm of the smart contract is illustrated in Fig. 2.

C. System Implementation Model
In order to implement the proposed algorithm on the
Ethereum Blockchain, first we carry out the process on a
smaller network using a local Blockchain; for which we use
TestRPC test Blockchain [10] to develop our prototype. As
mentioned earlier, the contract is written in solidity language,
we also develop the JavaScript platform to correspond to the
agents and objects defined in the contract. We use Truffle [11]
to create the decentralized system application and to deploy it
on to our test Blockchain and set up the market in real time.
The structure of this system is presented in Fig.3
III. CONTRACT THEORY BASED MODELING SCHEME
As claimed in [12], any practical contract designed for mar-
keting should satisfy the following three rules: (1) Individual
Rationality (IR): Each player in the market acts based on
rationality and works towards maximizing its personal gain.
(2) Incentive Compatibility (IC): The players will participate
in the market only when there are incentives that encour-
ages them to do so. In other words, there always must be
a parameter that propels player to actively engage in the
market. This principle is usually justified by using financial
compensation, which will be detailed later. (3) Preserving

utility and satisfaction level: To encourage the consumer to
engage and actively participate in the market, there needs to
be an acceptable level of satisfaction that keeps them from
leaving the market.
Based on the above principles, we design the coalition and
in the second step, its marketing appeal. Each group of geo-
graphically related prosumers with residential demand forms
a microgrid. As mentioned earlier, each coalition is linked to
the wholesale market via an aggregator. The sellers engage in
limited P2P energy trading via the associated aggregator. Con-
sidering that practically, it is difficult for the local generations
to be capable of meeting the demands throughout the whole
day. Especially in peak hours, the microgrid demands will
always be dependent on the main grid and wholesale market.
In this context, the aggregators are market entities that put their
financial utility and profit as their main motivation and in the
context of the contract, they are considered as the principles of
the contract. Based on the current maximum market price Xtn ,
the coalition’s total wholesale generation Gtn and the total
payment to the seller prosumers for their contribution to the
coalition P tn , and Atn as the profit of the aggregator which is
not a non-beneficiary entity, the contract is formed. To clarify
the structure of both sides of the market, the structure follows
this set of rules: the amount that each prosumer j contributes to
the main market is called G
tn
j which consists of its generation
from its DG unit, and based on this local generation, the
aggregator will pay the prosumers a collective compensation
which is proportional to their level of generation. Each seller
will have the option of cutting its own demand to contribute
more to the coalition. If, Seller j cuts more from its demand
to contribute to the sales, its financial turn over will be more
and its satisfaction level, Vj will be less. The satisfaction level
of the seller j can be defined as:
V
tn
j =
D
tn
j
D
tn
j0

where D
tn
j and D
tn
j0
are, respectively the demand of Seller
j, after and before demand cut. We can calculate, the total
available for sale generation of the coalition as:
G
tn =
∑
j
(
G
tn
j −D
tn
j
)
(2)
Based on this, the payment of each Prosumer j at Time-step
tn can be calculated as:
P
tn =
(
G
tn −A
tn
)
X
tn (3)
and Atn itself is proportional to total sales and in other words,
it represents a constant ratio of total sales which we call α,
so eq. (3) can be rewritten as:
P
tn =
(
G
tn(1− α)
)
X
tn (4)
Obviously, the transaction should be profitable to the sellers
to take part in the market, so the generation profit for each
seller prosumer should be higher than its cost of generation.
We note the cost of generation for Prosumer j at Time-
step tn as C
tn
j . So each seller determines what amount of
electricity generation it should contribute to the coalition while
preserving its satisfaction by optimizing the following cost
function:
Maximize
j
(
P
tn +
m∑
j=1
V
tn
j
)
(5)
Subject to :
{
V tn
j ≥ Tj
P
tn
j ≥ C
tn
j
where P tn is the individual payment of Seller j at the Time
tn for all m prosumers, which as mentioned earlier is propor-
tional to its generation contribution to the coalition and Tj is
defined as the minimum acceptable range of satisfaction index
for Seller j which is a pre-determined threshold. Therefore P tn
can be calculated as:
P
tn
j =
(
G
tn
j −D
tn
j
)
Gtn P
tn (6)
The model stated in Eq. (5) is a convex optimization problem,
and can be solved with a normal linear programming. There-
fore, we can safely assume that based on various thresholds
of different sellers, their participation ratio will also vary from
prosumer to prosumer.
IV. THE CASE STUDY
In our case study, we exploit a system with one hun-
dred prosumers with various satisfaction index thresholds and
different demands which form the coalition and unlimited
number of potential buyers. The total generation is based
on the accumulated generation of the PV panels of the said
prosumers. The prices are modeled in a manner to be only
dependent on the decision-making priorities of the buyers and
the cost of generation as described in previous section. The
demand profiles are based on average residential demand in
Akron, OH in 24-hour cycles [13]. Considering that showing
the behavior of all 100 prosumers can be very chaotic, we
demonstrate this behavior using bars which is presented in
Fig. 4.

Fig. 4: Generation and Demand of all of the Prosumers in 24 Hours
As shown in Fig. 4, the generation during the sunlight
hours is much higher and this causes most prosumers to
enter generation mode, which means that their generation
is higher than their demand, and thus the whole grid is
in excess mode, in which most of the prosummers are
self-sufficient and generation outweighs the demand. After
the sunlight diminishes and simultaneously the demand
increases, the reliability in local market also decreases and
the more prosumers are forced to incorporate the main grid
to support their demand. In the early morning hours, this
trend also follows with this difference that, the demand is
lower in those hours and the only possible limited local
generation can be from remnants of the local small scale
energy storage systems or by discharging electric vehicles. To
fully understand the effect of the local transactive grid on the
market and the satisfaction level of the prosumers, we present
the cumulative demand, generation and satisfaction index of
all the prosumers in Fig. 5. As shown in Fig. 5, the demand

the local generation. However, we can see that the prosumers
who sacrifice their satisfaction level for lower demand counter
demand deficit, which is an obvious result of the compromise
that they have made. Moreover, Fig.6 compares the ratio of
generation to demand versus satisfaction indices. From Fig.6,
we can observe that, the prosumers with a higher index of
satisfaction have lower generation to demand ratios, which
is expected. (Note: In Fig.6, the exact value of satisfaction
index is used, which is not the percentage, in order to show
the contrast better.)

V. CONCLUSION
By leveraging the opportunities that the Blockchain provides
for us, we develop a transactive electricity marketing model in
which local prosumers have the opportunity to engage in P2P
energy trading. In our model, we exploit the contract theory
to design a smart contract that ensures the real-time trade of
electricity with minimal need for oversight. The smart contract
provides a significant platform to establish and implement real-
time contracts for the electricity market. Our ongoing work
moves towards the design of electricity markets with more
adaptable smart contracts in which not only inputs and outputs
vary but also the structure of the contract will also change to
better replicate real life situations.
