Abstract
Purpose – This paper aims to assess the readiness of retail workers to use blockchain technology (BCT) to
improve supply chain performance. The assessment was made via a quantitative approach taken using a
theoretical framework based on Keller’s motivation model and self-determination theory in the BCT context.
Design/methodology/approach – The authors collected data from 567 retail workers from an emerging
country through a structured survey questionnaire. The authors tested the hypotheses of the proposed model
using Warp PLS 7.0 and controlled firm age, industry type and technological intensity.
Findings – Our findings may help firms in making the process of digital transformation inclusive.
The authors found that supplier-based attention and motivation through BCT lead to supply chain
performance, and that supplier-based satisfaction and trust achieved through BCT positively impact
supply chain performance. Further, supplier-based relevance on raw material selection with the higher
trust and motivation levels achieved through BCT was found to have a positive impact on supply chain
performance.
Research limitations/implications – IT supply chain applications are referred to as “lean” rather than
“rich” because they still rely mainly on written and numerical means to present data. When the environment is
less ambiguous, then less rich media can be used to facilitate communication. IT supply chain applications
allow suppliers to spend time building relationships with other suppliers instead of focusing on administrative
tasks, thus enhancing such relationships.
Originality/value – This study can be considered the first to assess retailer readiness to use BCT to improve
supply chain performance through the theoretical lens of Keller’s motivation model and self-determination
theory.

1. Introduction
The blockchain is an evolution of database technologies, such as distributed ledgers and
peer-to-peer networks. A distributed ledger technology contains a list of append-only,
timestamped transactions encrypted and backed by consensus mechanisms. In peer-to-peer
networks, immutable records are permanently stored over a decentralized network of equal
peers (Hwang et al., 2018). Several decades have passed since blockchain technologies were
first developed (e.g. Bamakan et al., 2021; Jang andHan, 2022; Bai et al., 2020). As conventional
work methods may prove ineffective during disruptive events like pandemics, businesses
need to adapt and transform their business practices (Bai et al., 2020; Sangal et al., 2022).

Most firms have worked toward digital transformation (DT) in a phased manner
(Bumblauskas et al., 2020; B€uttgen et al., 2021; Sangal et al., 2022). The fourth industrial
revolution (known as Industry 4.0) has made firms transition seamlessly to digital
technologies. As a result, firms have been able to use connected technologies in the interphase
between the virtual and the real (Philbeck and Davis, 2018; Xu et al., 2018). Most extant
studies have discussed how new-age technologies have helped firms gain a competitive
advantage, improve firm performance, enhance supply chain coordination, etc. (Di Vaio and
Varriale, 2020; Frizzo-Barker et al., 2020). In this regard, blockchain technology (BCT) enables
teams to establish trust (Di Vaio and Varriale, 2020; Frizzo-Barker et al., 2020). Despite the
progress made in regard to understanding specific aspects of DT, we still lack a detailed
understanding of it and its effects in several contexts. According to previous studies, digital
technologies can trigger strategic changes, disrupt the way organizations create and transfer
value, and manage the changes required for social and organizational structure.
Despite the advancements made in DT research, most of it is still conducted with firm-
level data (Di Vaio and Varriale, 2020; Frizzo-Barker et al., 2020).While it is vital to implement
and adopt DT at the firm level, it is equally important to study its percolation across the entire
supply chain network and its actors, with retailers being among the most crucial ones in a
supply chain network structure. Recent studies have reported that supply chain firms
struggle to include retailers in the DT process, which negatively affects their efficiency
(Brookbanks and Parry, 2022; Di Vaio and Varriale, 2020), including chain firm inclusivity in
the DT process. Thus, based on the foundational aspects of Keller’s motivation model (which
is further grounded in expectancy-value theory), we aimed to investigate retailer readiness to
adapt to BCT and improve supply chain performance (Hooks, 2022). The key antecedents that
explain retailer trust in technology would be satisfaction, attention, confidence and relevance
(Walczuch and Lundgren, 2004). Trust would then act as an antecedent indicator to the use of
BCT, which would further help improve supply chain performance (Blomqvist and Cook,
2018; Brookbanks and Parry, 2022).
We therefore assessed the readiness of retail workers to use BCT to improve supply chain
performance by proposing a conceptual model using the theoretical constructs of Keller’s
motivationmodel (Blomqvist and Cook, 2018; Brookbanks and Parry, 2022). Blockchain drive
plays a crucial role in the retail sector by facilitating the use of digital money (Creydt and
Fischer, 2019). The importance of assessing retail worker readiness to use BCT in the supply
chain performance context varies based on fast-moving consumer goods.
Although blockchain-based food traceability systems have been discussed in the
literature (Creydt and Fischer, 2019; Pearson, 2019), few studies have explored consumer
preferences for such systems. This represents an important research gap because the cost of
implementing a new traceability system depends on consumer preferences and perceptions
(Jin et al., 2017). Numerous studies have examined the impact of traceability systems on
retailers (Sangal et al., 2022), commonly analyzing such systems in relation to brand- or
product-related outcomes, such as willingness to pay or purchase intention (Creydt and
Fischer, 2019; Sangal et al., 2022). Retailers also make decisions about traceability according
to practical evidence. Despite several factors – e.g. consumer psychological states – being
identified as significant predictors (Spiggle and Sewall, 1987). According to recent research,
there is a need to study consumer perceptions of traceability systems and their effect on their
trustworthiness.
Numerous studies have examined the impact of retailer pricing strategies on consumer
behaviors. Our study was aimed at better understanding of retailer pricing strategies under
conditions of duopolistic competition. Studies have examined the pricing strategies of
differentiated enterprises in duopolistic competition. Belleflamme and Vergote (2016), while
Valletti and Wu (2020) examined retailer pricing strategies in oligopolistic competition.
According to Kehoe et al. (2018), big data impacts price competition for brand experience
JEIM
products in oligopolistic markets. Seetharaman and Che (2009) examined price competition in
markets characterized by consumer demand for variety. Chen et al. (2020) investigated the
segmentation pricing of competing companies with complete consumer information.
According to Aviv and Pazgal (2008), consumer behaviors influence price segmentation.
According to Li et al. (2021), greater availability of information about providers increases the
likelihood of consumers’ purchasing.
Belleflamme et al. (2020) examined the possibility of competitive firms gaining market
power by discriminating against prices. In the retail sector, BCT plays a significant role in
enterprise operations management (Belleflamme et al., 2020). BCT also poses several risks,
which hackers may exploit and compromise or leak the data stored in the blockchain
(Belleflamme et al., 2020). Manufacturers can also take advantage of the agility of small
retailers to explore emerging opportunities in more challenging ways with larger customers.
This study differed from previous studies wherein strategic supplier partnership was less
heavily weighted in supply chain management (SCM) practices. Long-term relationships are
less relevant to extracting value from supply chain relationships because organizational
learning concentrates more on the owner/manager.
As BCT gains momentum, many players are participating in its applications. Platform-
based business models are anticipated to enhance competitive advantages as one of the select
emerging technologies (Burkett et al., 2016). Supplier-based attention andmotivation through
BCT lead to supply chain performance in multiple ways, as some firms may achieve
collaborative benefits through effective customer account management. According to
Ramaswami et al. (2008), customer account management refers to identifying and
understanding value generators to provide customers with a complete experience. Keller’s
ARCS model was one of the pioneering works in motivational design, aimed at making
instruction more appealing to learners (Keller, 1983). Motivation is often considered an input
variable of the id that each learner brings to the process and should be considered a potential
distraction during the working environment. In an emerging economy or in the process of
developing their retail skills, chilled temperature-controlled distribution is one of the most
demanding disciplines in logistics and is a critical sector for retailers in an emerging industry.
This shows the importance of taking a whole channel approach rather than an attitude of
“I’ve done my part; let others do theirs”. Retailers in emerging economies need to get the fresh
food sector right to build consumer trust and confidence that the products will be tasty
and fresh.
A successful implementation of BCTs within a supply chain requires understanding how
the supply chain network impacts professional behaviors within and among companies (Dai
et al., 2019). The addition of an environmental component will further complicate the adoption
of BCT in SCM due to the increased number and type of stakeholders involved (Dai et al.,
2019). Some of the example applications of BCT in the supply chain are the timeliness of
supply chain related transactions in the food chain supply of McDonald’s, KFC and similar
fast-food restaurants (Marsden et al., 2000; Aung and Chan, 2014). Incorporating BCT into the
supply chain creates a new channel for the distribution of goods between suppliers and
customers. In emerging country retail markets, blockchain management lacks organization
(Nigam et al., 2022a, b). In emerging markets, blockchain implementation in retail is rare,
despite the industry’s challenges (Jin et al., 2017). In the retail market, monetary transaction
policies lack transparency for consumer buy-and-sell transactions (Creydt and Fischer, 2019;
Pearson, 2019). The acceptance of blockchain for retailers following the implementation of
Blockchain Adoption policies in emerging country retail markets has yet to be studied
(Creydt and Fischer, 2019; Pearson, 2019).
The role of blockchain, transaction policies and the experience of blockchain in
determining blockchain implementation. Some of the examples are shipping (Song, 2021;
Vernimmen et al., 2007) and insurance industries (Lin et al., 2010) in emerging economies.
Assessing
retailer
readiness to
use BCT
There is a growing consensus in regard to the outdatedness and inadequacy of retail buying
and selling processes for online (P2P) transactions (Creydt and Fischer, 2019; Pearson, 2019).
In addition, no further initiatives are being taken to implement customer payment systems
and BCT in the retail sector. As BCT can facilitate sustainable SCM, SCs can help in
addressing unethical behaviors (e.g. Gurtu and Johny, 2019; Kshetri, 2021), which tend to
occur most often in developing countries (Kshetri, 2021). In areas such as the environment
(Fikru, 2014) and child labor practices (Doepke and Zilibotti, 2005), emerging countries lack
adequate regulations and enforcement mechanisms. In relation to sustainability, most
companies operating in emerging countries do not go beyond compliance requirements
(Jeppesen and Hansen, 2004).
Should developing economy companies invest substantially in new technologies, training
employees, and obtaining international certifications, their products would become more
expensive. In developing countries, sustainability issues are challenging because of a lack of
trust and high intermediation costs. BCT may be suited to address these issues. Besides
decentralization, BCT, which can eliminate the need for institutional and personal
intermediaries, facilitates trust and disintermediation (Gurtu and Johny, 2019; Kshetri,
2021), for which there is a critical need in developing countries.
Several factors have contributed to the use of BCT to facilitate the development of
sustainable SCs in developing countries. Regulations, activists and consumers increasingly
force companies to build sustainable supply chains, which may also combat corruption and
unethical behaviors (LeBaron, 2021) in these countries. However, researchers have hitherto
examined BCT in the developing world (Kshetri and Voas, 2019; Gurtu and Johny, 2019;
Kouhizadeh and Sarkis, 2018). A lack of adequate record-keeping systems, commonplace
public mistrust in regulators, and widespread smartphone use explain the early adoption of
BCT in developing countries (Hald and Kinra, 2019). It has been suggested that BCT can play
a significant role in tackling corruption (Kenny, 2017; Kshetri and Voas, 2019), protecting
property rights (Kshetri and Voas, 2019) and creating secure digital identities (Kshetri and
Voas, 2019). The above discussion led to our research question.
RQ1. How can retailer readiness toward BCT help improve supply chain performance?
The next section of this paper discusses the theoretical underpinnings used in developing the
study. The subsequent sections discuss the research design, focusing on how the data was
collected. The results are then discussed, with their clear contribution to theory and practice.
This study makes two main contributions to the literature. First, several scholars have
argued that supply chains currently do handle quality data that can be transferred
immediately among each process, such as procurement (Doepke and Zilibotti, 2005),
purchasing (Ellram, 1996; Gurtu and Johny, 2019), retailing (Ganesan et al., 2009), raw
materials handling (Kain and Verma, 2018) and other internal supply chain related activities.
To assess retail worker readiness to use BCT to improve supply chain performance (Nigam
et al., 2022a, 2022b), we developed a conceptual framework based on the theoretical
constructs of Keller’s motivation model. We did so by means of a quantitative approach
suited to track the slow and manual ongoing processes within supply chain activities. It is
true that supply chains are currently capable of handling large, complex datasets, but many
of the related processes, especially those enacted in the lower supply tiers, are very slow (Kain
and Verma, 2018; Behl et al., 2022). The purpose of this study was thus to identify the weak
points within the overall management structure.
Second, this study assesses the readiness of retail workers to use BCT to improve supply
chain performance. Based on the results, supplier-based attention, motivation, supplier-based
satisfaction, trust, supplier-based relevance to raw material selection, and confidence with
higher levels of trust and motivation contribute to supply chain performance. This could be
further investigated by future researchers in the context of various industries, particularly
JEIM
the shipping one, in relation to mitigating the high costs of reputational damage (Qu et al.,
2019; Kamalapur and Lyth, 2020).
2. Theoretical underpinnings and hypotheses development
To create a conceptual framework suited to investigate retailer readiness toward BCT to
improve supply chain performance, our study was conducted based on the theoretical
frameworks of Keller’s motivation model and self-determination theory (Kshetri and Voas,
2019). This section justifies in detail the applicability of the three theories of Keller’s
motivation model and self-determination theory (Kshetri and Voas, 2019).
2.1 Keller’s ARCS motivation model
This model of motivational design (Keller, 1983) includes a synthesis of the motivational
concepts and theories that fall into four categories: attention (A), relevance (R), confidence (C)
and satisfaction (S). Keller’s ARCS model was one of the pioneering works in motivational
design, aimed to make instruction more appealing to learners (Keller, 1983). Motivation is
often considered an n input variable of the id that each learner brings to the process and that
should be considered a potential distraction during teaching. Motivation is also a variable in
the instructional process and should be protected within it (Keller, 1983). In the ARCS model,
learning motivation is seen not only as an input and process variable but also as an output
one (Keller, 1983). Ideally, a motivational design stimulates a learner to continue his studies
due to the interaction with well-designed instructional material (Kshetri and Voas, 2019).
Developing the ability to appeal to learners would result in high levels of motivation (Kshetri
and Voas, 2019).
2.2 Self-determination theory
According to self-determination theory, supervisory support for basic psychological needs is
associated with autonomous self-regulation at work, social well-being and work-related
functioning in employees (Gagn�e and Deci, 2005; Pine et al., 1993). In recent years,
manufacturers have begun to realize the benefits and importance of cooperative
relationships, thereby calling for an expanded approach to SCM (e.g. Farooque et al., 2022).
A sense of autonomy is usually associated with something important to the individual. The
need for competence reflects a desire to feel capable of producing any desired outcome and
preventing undesirable ones, rather than controlled motivation and choice (Vallerand and
Ratelle, 2002).
2.3 Hypotheses development
Supply chain collaboration is as relevant today as it was two decades ago (Bowersox et al.,
2003; Dyer and Singh, 1998; Mentzer et al., 2000). Companies have worked together to achieve
successful outsourcing and offshoring initiatives, and collaborate to take advantage of
reshoring opportunities (Tate, 2014; Yang et al., 2015). An SC collaboration maximizes
synergistic benefits, improves operational performance and increases competitiveness
(Daugherty, 2011; Whipple and Kenis, 2010). Fawcett et al. (2008) suggested that SC
collaboration is based on a commitment that goes beyond what is expected of a discrete
market transaction. By sharing resources, risks and rewards between partners, collaboration
creates a competitive advantage for firms and consumer product value (Davis et al., 2019;
Esper et al., 2010). As BCT gains momentum, many applications and players begin to
participate in its applications. BCT has been described as the most important invention since
the inception of Internet, and has been identified as one of the top ten strategic technology

use BCT
trends. As a select emerging technology, platform-based business models are anticipated to
enhance competitive advantages. This led us to formulating our first hypothesis:
H1a. Satisfaction has a positive influence on user trust in supply chain performance
There is growing evidence that attitudes and their formation can explain various observable
behaviors and predict future behaviors and intentions. By effectively managing customer
accounts, some firms may achieve collaborative benefits through supplier-based satisfaction
and motivation. In relation to providing customers with a complete experience, Ramaswami
et al. (2008) defined customer account management as identifying and understanding value
generators. According to Mentzer et al. (2001), SCM can lead to customer loyalty and
preference. Once they have understood the needs and wants of their customers, firms may
collaborate with SC partners to enhance their value to them. By means of a differentiated
offering powered by SC collaboration, they may be able to create competitive advantage and
build long-term relationships with their customers. We thus hypothesized the following:
H1b. Satisfaction has a positive influence on user motivation toward supply chain
performance
Despite its positive impact on user trust in supply chain performance, attention has been
widely featured in the investigation of various aspects of information security in
organizations. Within a value chain’s functions, a lack of security awareness is considered
one of the primary causes of vulnerability. We examined security awareness and behavior in
an organizational setting. A cognitive behavior context is related to how an individual
perceives objects, such as people, products, brands, etc. For mobile users, cognitive
behavioral stage motivations are conscious decisions relating to behavioral purpose of
serving user-driven needs (functional service delivery anywhere, anytime, and the ease of use
and usefulness of smartphones), social needs connecting with others, or enjoyment of using
the device. An object’s affective behavior (smartphones) is the way one feels about it.
Engaged behavior is characterized by energy, involvement and efficacy, and is defined as a
behavioral flow devoid of any intentional mindset, such as control, attention, focus, curiosity
and/or intrinsic interest (Whipple et al., 2015). There is no such thing as a momentary or
specific state of engagement; a cognitive-affective state is pervasive and persistent (Whipple
et al., 2015). Through customer satisfaction, increased sales, and employee retention,
engagement and profitability are strongly related at both the organizational and individual
levels, focusing mainly on the component of user trust in supply chain performance.
Moralized content within a value chain has an emotional component, such as maintaining
relationships with suppliers and buyers. Perceptual SCM systems are naturally tuned to
detect any stimuli associated with morality and emotion. The use of social media provides
instant access to awide variety of information. Initially, this feature is likely to be beneficial in
maintaining customers within the value chain by enabling them to learn about or become
aware of ideas they would not otherwise encounter (e.g. news, education and products). It is
important to note, however, that increased access to information comes at a price. Although
access to information has increased, our ability to pay attention to has decreased. Emerging
technologies may engender customer loyalty and preferences when a firm uses effective SCM
and SC collaboration. Zakaria and Dhar (2021) defined collaborative process competency as
an intraorganizational skill that lays the foundation for successful SC collaborations
(Whipple et al., 2015). Hence, in the literature, supplier-based attention and motivation
through BCT have been identified as having the potential to improve performance levels
within the supply chain (Whipple et al., 2015). This can be achieved by increasing the number
of players participating in applications when dealing with suppliers. We thus hypothesized
the following:
JEIM
H2a. Attention has a positive influence on user motivation toward supply chain
performance
Companies often collaborate with their supply chain partners to manage goods and
information flows, but not cash ones. For example, Zhao et al. (2008) documented some
prominent examples in the automotive industry. Other sectors can also be disrupted by
systematic payment term extensions (Garcia-Appendini and Montoriol-Garriga, 2013).
According to Garcia-Appendini and Montoriol-Garriga (2013), financial flows need to be
managed better. Median inventories were 18.3% of all assets in the 1980s, but decreased to
7.4% in the 2000s. Management tools should be explored in order to improve the supply
chain. Flow occurs when an activity is difficult and involves risk (Whipple et al., 2015). As a
result, individuals’ capacities are stretched, and their skills are challenged. As it provides the
best user experience, it has become the critical element of the theory of optimal experience
(Whipple et al., 2015) with regard to user trust and attention within the supply chain.
We hypothesized the following:
H2b. Attention has a positive influence on user trust in supply chain performance
Due to the rapid development of IT networking, social networks are becoming
increasingly popular. Due to some unresolved issues, such as trust, security and
privacy, social networking applications cannot however be widely accepted by many
users. Further, when considering the theoretical constructs in terms of user trust in
supply chain performance, trust graphs consist of trustors, trustees, recommenders and
the trust relationships between them (Mentzer et al., 2001). Using trust value and
confidence level as trust factors, we can derive four trust metrics based on these two
factors: maximum flow of trust value, maximum flow of confidence level, minimum
uncertainty cost with maximum flow of trust, and minimummistrust cost with maximum
flow of trust. Trust on technology is related to relatedness to perform task and more
importantly its relevance in a specific context. While most studies refer to testing the
relationship between trust, but they miss on understanding its antecedent of relevance.
We hypothesized the following:
H3a. Relevance has a positive influence on user trust in supply chain performance
Csikszentmihalyi (1990) stated that flow occurs more often at work than during a person’s
free time. Flow states are more easily achieved in activities such as performing music,
dancing and writing because they have rules and require skills. As a result of participating in
enjoyable activities, people become deeply engaged and motivated. Passive activities like
watching television do not usually lead to flow. According to Steven Pritzker, television
shows can elicit audience flow if they are relevant to viewers. By applying theoretical
viewpoints, it is possible to justify how supplier-based satisfaction and trust can lead to
supply chain performance.
In today’s competitive business environment, SCM is widely recognized as an essential
tool for cost control and economic performance improvement (Dub�e et al., 2017; Perakis
and Sun, 2014). However, given rising issues – such as the increased complexity of supply
chains, transparency and flexibility demands – task-based challenges and supply
management practices must be modernized if companies and industries wish to remain
competitive (Dub�e et al., 2017; Perakis and Sun, 2014; Goldsby et al., 2013). The success of
SC collaboration may be influenced by factors other than collaborative process
competency. As a result, we formulated the following hypothesis:
H3b. Relevance has a positive influence on user motivation toward supply chain
performance
Assessing
retailer
readiness to
use BCT
BCT can further improve supplier-based relevance on the raw material selection with higher
trust and motivation levels. It can enhance supply chains by speeding up delivery and
reducing costs, traceability, coordination between partners, and financing (Lavoie et al., 2021).
As globalization hasmademanaging and controlling supply chainsmore challenging (Lavoie
et al., 2021), BCT –which ensures transparency, traceability and security –may be helpful in
global SCM. The literature focuses on conceptualizing the impact of BCT on SCM.
Kouhizadeh et al. (2021) identified several barriers to the adoption of BCT in supply chains
and considered how supplier-based relevance on the raw material selection with higher trust
and motivation levels could affect the supply chain performance of local and global supply
chains. There are two fundamental reasons to focus on this aspect: higher motivation and
trust levels. As a result, the following hypothesis was formulated:
H4a. Confidence has a positive impact on user trust in supply chain performance
According to Lee et al. (2018), SCM encompasses logistics, operations, materials, marketing,
purchasing and information technology. Devarajet al. (2007) stated that organizations should
optimize their organizational (Gupta and Starr, 2006) and quality performance. Ensure the
health and optimal functioning of end-to-end supply chains (SCs) by monitoring each
component (Gautam et al., 2017). Therefore, the technology adopted by organizations should
be able to meet a variety of needs, and business decisions should be able to maximize the
value of technology. Additionally, disparate systems in SCM limit transparency and
visibility. In uncertain environments, these factors impede decision-making in SCs that
revolves around “control and adaptation”, which improves confidence within the supply
chain activities.
H4b. Confidence has a positive impact on user motivation toward supply chain
performance
The literature has recently reported thatmotivation levels varywith BCT-based supply chain
performance in various ways (Lavoie et al., 2021). A modern supply chain is characterized by
multitiered and geographically dispersed entities competing to serve consumers (Lavoie et al.,
2021). Globalization, various regulatory policies and cultural differences make it hard to
evaluate information and manage risk in this intricate network. Due to inefficient
transactions, fraud, pilferage and poorly performing supply chains, there is a lack of trust
and a need for better information sharing. Supply chain entities and customers cannot
determine the actual value of an item without transparency (Lavoie et al., 2021). Agri-food
(Costa et al., 2022), pharmaceuticals and medical devices (Razak et al., 2021) and high-value
goods (Nitsche et al., 2021) are just some of the industries in which traceability is critical.
Often, expensive and high-value items the provenance of which is based on paper certificates
and receipts can be lost or altered (Nitsche et al., 2021). A supply chain’s traceability is further
complicated by the costs and reliability of intermediaries (Lavoie et al., 2021), which creates
strategic and reputational competitive issues. This further shows the link between supplier-
based relevance in the raw material selection and higher trust and motivation levels due to
cost-effectiveness, the usefulness of updated technology, and supplier networking abilities.
We hypothesized the following:
H5. Trust has a positive impact on the use of BCT toward supply chain performance
SCM relies on the collaboration and coordination of several stakeholders to optimize the flow
of goods, information and financial resources through the entire supply chain, as in supplier-
based confidence with higher trust and motivation levels enhanced through BCT (Mentzer
et al., 2001). As supply chains are heavily reliant upon centralized, sometimes disparate, and
stand-alone information management systems within organizations, increasing supplier
confidence and trust levels through BCT leads to improved supply chain performance
JEIM
(Mentzer et al., 2001). Enterprise resource planning systems, for example, have their own
setbacks. To rely on a single organization or broker for the storage of sensitive and valuable
information, supply chain entities must establish high levels of trust (Kouhizadeh et al., 2021).
As a result of the single point of failure of centralized information systems, the entire system
has the potential for error, hacking, corruption and attacks (Vallerand and Ratelle, 2002),
which emphasizes the increased levels of trust and motivation achieved by BCT within
supply chain functions.
H6. Motivation has a positive impact on the use of BCT toward supply chain
performance
BCT has emerged as a potential solution to the erosion of trust in traditional institutions and
online intermediaries because it eliminates the need for trust between the parties sharing
information (Dolgui and Ivanov 2021). Rather than submitting themselves to the authority of
a centralized institution, users submit themselves to the authority of BCT. Regardless of its
purpose and when it is functioning correctly, a public blockchain undeniably mitigates the
principal–agent issues associated with trusted relationships (e.g. moral hazard and shirking).
As a result, many refer to BCT as a “trustless” or “trust-free” technology. However, the
academic discussion of BCT emphasizes this central property from a negative perspective:
BCT does not depend on trust to function. It has been relatively difficult to examine the
implied positive perspective, namely what. In order to address this gap, this article embeds
the discussion about trust in BCT within a broader sociological and philosophical discussion
on trust and confidence (Razak et al., 2021). Hence, our next hypothesis was the following:
H7. The use of BCT positively impacts supply chain performance
The current call for papers in BCT-based research pertains to the fact that the four
perspectives of satisfaction, relevance, attention and confidence have yet to be investigated
from the perspective of the self-determination theory and Keller’s ARCS motivation model
(Lavoie et al., 2021). This led to our study’s conceptual framework development (Refer
Figure 1).
3. Methodology
In order to test the relationships proposed in the conceptual model, we collected primary data
through a structured survey. We tested the survey questionnaire for face validity with ten

academic experts who hadmore than six years of experience in teaching information systems
and who had published research on emerging trends in supply chains. Additionally,
we invited ten retail store supply chain managers to participate in the pilot testing of the
questionnaire. We incorporated the suggestions made by our 20 pilot participants to improve
the questions’ brevity and flow and eliminate any ambiguity in the questionnaire by
rephrasing certainmeasurement items.Wemodified previously studied constructs to suit our
study’s context. For item finalization, our adapted constructs were further approved by the
experts, leading to their operationalization. We then administered the final questionnaire to
567 retailers from India. The following section describes the operationalization of the
constructs, which played a vital role in designing the structured questionnaire.
3.1 Instrument design and the operationalization of our constructs
We designed the initial questionnaire by borrowing items from established scales. We
collected the data for each measurement item using a five-point Likert scale ranging from
1 5 “Strongly Disagree” to 5 5 “Strongly Agree”. We gauged the study’s constructs using
subjective measures, in line with the practice found across the organization and information
literature (Behl et al., 2022). Eighteen items were adapted from the ARCSmodel (Keller, 1987).
Trust was measured using the scale suggested by Dennis et al. (2012). Motivation was
measured based on the scale developed by Behl et al. (2022). The use of BCTwas measured in
line with Shin (2019). Supply chain performance was measured using Queiroz and Wamba’s
(2019) scale.
The experts also checked for completeness and flow. The final version of the questionnaire
was structured in two parts. The initial section pertained to the demographic profile of the
respondents, with questions aimed at inquiring about their socio-economic and cultural
backgrounds. The questionnaire was further shared with eight practitioners and seven
academics who all had rich experience in working with technologies in the retail sector. They
reviewed it in regard to various aspects like readability, relatedness, completeness and
structure and suggested improvements (Lang et al., 2022). The authors took the suggestions
into account to perform a final revision of the questionnaire. The questionnaire thus finalized
was then used for the data collection.
3.2 Data collection
We collected cross-sectional data by reaching out to retailers in the supply chains of
products. In the first collection round (February 2022), we contacted a total of 1,013 firms,
fromwhich we received a total of 342 responses. After four weeks (March 2022), we engaged
in a second wave of data collection in which we took a snowballing approach to increase the
sample size, contacting 594 respondents by posting on various groups on LinkedIn and
professional associations with a global presence. In those cases in which we received
multiple responses from the same organization, we took their average score so that the
dataset would have a unique representation of data from each organization. In order to verify
the profiles of the respondents, we shared two emails – one before and one after the data
collection process – to validate their email addresses by sharing a one-time password on their
associated/reported email addresses. The final questionnaire was administered using an
online form that included clear instructions to avoid any confusion. While we collected our
data through a single platform, we did take into account any cognitive biases that could have
affected our findings. We thus performed a wave analysis, as proposed by Armstrong and
Overton (1977). We split our respondents into two groups (waves 1 and 2), which included,
respectively, the first 40 and the last 40, and performed a t-test to check whether there
was any statistically significant difference between their responses. Based on the T-test
results, we were able to conclude that there was no such difference between the two groups
JEIM
(p5 0.18), which confirmed the absence of nonresponse bias in the study. Table 1 shows the
demographic profiles of the respondents.
4. Data analysis and results
4.1 Measurement model
We evaluated our conceptual framework using theWarp PLS 7.0 software, which uses partial
least squares structured equation modelling (Kock, 2019). The latent variables needed to be
estimated as weighted aggregations of indicators without adjusting for the measurement
errors found in typical partial least sqaure (PLS) estimations (Kock, 2019). According to
Henseler et al. (2016), measurement errors dominate actual indicators, which can be seen in
the composite indicators. Kock (2019) asserted that measurement errors cannot be eliminated
as deficiencies in composite indicators may lead to an unknown bias. In recent years, PLS-
SEM has become a common alternative to survey-based research. With PLS-SEM, complex
models can be examined without imposing distributional assumptions. Therefore, although
our framework is based on current theoretical models, PLS-SEM was the best tool for
reviewing our study’s proposed complex framework (Kock, 2019; Sarstedt et al., 2014).
We examined the nomological validity of the theoretical model also usingWARP PLS 7.0.
To do so, we carried out three types of validations: construct, content and discriminant, along
with testing the effect size and model fit parameters. We then examined the structural model
to assess the strength of the associated variables. Content validity was established through
the feedback obtained by the experts on the questionnaire. The internal consistency of the
constructs was examined using Cronbach’s alpha and Composite Reliability (CR). Their
values were found to be above 0.7, indicating that construct reliability and validity were met.
The average variance extracted (AVE), factor loadings and CR values were found to be above
the threshold values –AVE> 0.5 (Fornell and Larcker, 1981), factor loadings > 0.7 (Hair et al.,
2017) and CR > 0.7 (Hair et al., 2011) – thus satisfying the criteria for construct reliability and
convergent validity (Hair et al., 2006). The psychometric properties of the constructs are
presented in Table 2.

We tested for discriminant validity using two methods: (1) Fornell–Larcker’s criterion,
whereby the square root of theAVE of the construct (the italicized bold-face values inTable 3)
was found to be greater than its correlations with the other variables, (2) the heterotrait-
monotrait ratio of correlation (HTMT) ratio values, which were found to be greater than 0.85
(as mentioned in Table 4), thereby confirming discriminant validity (Franke and Starsted,
2019). The study did not suffer from any multicollinearity issues, as the items’ variance
inflated factor (VIF) values were found to be lower than 5 (Kock, 2015a, b).
With convergent and discriminant validity having been established, we concluded that
construct validity was established. Further, we examined the model fit indices (Table 5), the
values of which were found to fall within the thresholds suggested by Sarstedt et al. (2014) –

4.2 Common method bias
The data for our study were cross-sectional, wherein we collected the data for both the
dependent and independent variables at a single point in time from the same participants,
which could result in commonmethod bias (CMB) (Kock, 2015a, b). To reduce the effect of any
CMB caused by social desirability bias, we informed the respondents that their responses
would be treated with the utmost confidentiality and used only for academic purposes. We
encouraged them to answer the survey to the best of their knowledge. Further, we
randomized the questions in the study and self-administered the questionnaire to control for
CMB. Next, we performed Harman’s single-factor test, the results of which indicated that the
latent factor explained 36.4% of the total variance, thus being lower than the acceptable
threshold of 50% (Podsakoff et al., 2003).
The data were further checked for causality using the nonlinear bivariate causality
direction ratio (NLBCDR) (Kock, 2015a, b), which yielded a value of 0.787, thus being higher
than the threshold value of 0.7, as indicated in Table 6, implying that our study did not suffer
from causality.

4.3 Hypotheses testing
Figure 2 presents the path model obtained from PLS-SEM after testing the proposed
associations using Warp PLS. We used the bootstrapping method in PLS to estimate the
standard error and significance of parametric estimates.
The hypotheses testing revealed a positive association between satisfaction and trust and
satisfaction and motivation, thereby supporting H1a and H1b. For a hypothesis to be
supported, the path coefficient needed to be significant, with a p-value lower than 0.05 (Hair
et al., 2011). The significance of the paths was found to indicate positive empirical support for
H1a (β 5 0.34, p < 0.001), H1b (β 5 0.37, p < 0.001), H2a (β 5 0.26, p < 0.001), H3a (β 5 0.33,

the strengths of the relationships proposed in the conceptual model with their associated
significance level. We then tested the effect of the control variables (firm age, industry type
and technological intensity) and found that none had any significant impact. The results were
found to suggest a nonsignificant association between attention and motivation, thus
refuting H2b (β 5 0.009, p < 0.01). Likewise, the relationship between confidence and
motivation was found to be nonsignificant, thus not supporting H4b (β 5 �0.008, p < 0.01).
R2, which represents the model’s explanatory power, was found to be 0.918, within the
acceptable threshold. Next, we examined the effect size using Cohen’s f2 formula (Cohen,
1992). We calculate the model’s predictability power using Q2. The values were 35% (trust),
26.7% (motivation), 31.1% (use of BCT) and 43.4% (supply chain performance). The next
section discusses the results and presents the implications for retailers.
5. Discussion of the findings
This section discusses the hypotheses’ results in detail.
5.1 Supplier-based satisfaction and motivation through BCT lead to supply chain
performance
The first hypothesis (H1) posited that supplier-based satisfaction and motivation through
BCT lead to supply chain performance. The results were found to indicate a strong positive
coefficient value. BCT has significantly disrupted traditional business processes; centralized
transactions and applications, which were previously verified by third parties or centralized
architectures, can now be decentralized and maintain the same level of assurance (Tschorsch
and Scheuermann, 2016). There is further justification for the performance of suppliers based
on BCT, as cryptocurrencies (Chen, 2018), demonstrate the importance of BCT in today’s
society. Due to the heterogeneity of cryptocurrency applications, interoperability issues may
arise in the future (Tschorsch and Scheuermann, 2016; Haferkorn and Quintana Diaz, 2015).
Beyond cryptocurrencies, Smart Contracts play a central role in BCT applications. In 1994,
Szabo defined smart contracts as computerized transaction protocols that execute the
contract’s terms (Szabo, 1994), minimizing external participation. Despite their lack of trust,
the terms of an agreement are automatically enforced. Thus, within the context of BCT, SCs
are scripts that run decentralized and are stored on the blockchain in a decentralized manner,
without relying on trusted authorities (Christidis and Devetsikiotis, 2016).
5.2 Supplier-based satisfaction and trust through BCT lead to supply chain performance
The second hypothesis (H2), which predicted that supplier-based trust and satisfaction lead
to supply chain performance, was supported. It is well known that blockchains are
timestamped, append-only data structures (Christidis and Devetsikiotis, 2016). Using BCT,
non-trusting members can interact without the need for a trusted authority (Christidis and
Devetsikiotis, 2016). Numerous platforms support the use of blockchain-based applications,
such as OpenChain, Corda, Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric, which holds great promise in
the field of SCM. As a distributed ledger system, Hyperledger Fabric is an open-source
project. The use of BCT in applications has received relatively little attention in spite of
several reviews (Tama et al., 2017).
A number of studies have examined the role played by BCT in the IoT, including
decentralized and data-intensive applications (Conoscenti et al., 2016) and data
decentralization (Karafiloski and Mishev, 2017). BCT has been studied for its security
issues (Meng et al., 2020), as well as for its potential to enable trust and decentralization in
service systems (Berner et al., 2019) and peer-to-peer networks (Hald and Kinra, 2019). The
security and privacy issues associated with blockchains are discussed by Meng et al. (2020).

Through the use of BCT, the detailed identification of these factors will enhance supplier-
based satisfaction and trust.
5.3 Supplier-based relevance on raw material selection with higher trust and motivation
levels improved through blockchain technology leads to supply chain performance
Our third hypothesis (H3) – which posited that supplier-based relevance on raw material
selection with higher trust and motivation levels improved through BCT leads to supply
chain performance – was found to be supported. Outsourcing and global sourcing have
led to longer, more complex and fragmented supply chains. There are multiple challenges
associated with supply chain (H�akansson and Persson, 2004; Lamming et al., 2000; Pathak
et al., 2007). Aside from nonlinear dynamics, self-organization, emergence and
coevolution, MSCs also exhibit nonlinear dynamics, reverse loops and multi-way
exchanges (Pathak et al., 2007). The objective is to gain a deeper understanding of
the structure, behavior and performance of MSCs by analyzing the factors that influence
the supplier-based relevance of raw material selection through BCT. By integrating the
circular economy concept throughout the entire supply chain process, stakeholders
within the supply chain can develop innovative business models and relevant supply
chain functions. During the entire supply chain life cycle, all the appropriate resources can
be upcycled to achieve zero waste. This is known as circular supply chain management,
and is crucial to operationalize a circular economy at the micro level (Govindan and
Hasanagic, 2018). As a result of its implementation, tracking the upcycling of materials
over multiple life cycles becomes a challenge across various stakeholders in the
supply chain.
5.4 Supplier-based confidence with higher trust and motivation levels improved through
BCT leads to supply chain performance
In supply chains, certain entities – e.g. manufacturers, distributors, retailers and customers –
participate in the production and sale of commodities (Karafiloski and Mishev, 2017;
Corazzini, 1977). The purpose of SCM is to prepare, plan, execute, supervise and track SC
operations in order to increase profit, develop strategic infrastructure, optimize global
logistics, synchronize supply with demand, and/or assess global efficiency. Our fourth
hypothesis (H4), which proposed that BCT leads to higher supplier-based confidence, trust
and motivation levels, thereby improving supply chain performance, was found to be
supported. Some factors have contributed to the attention given to BCT. This technology has
led to significant growth in supply chain traceability, sustainability and information security
(Francisco and Swanson, 2018). Multiple circular economy challenges can also be addressed
simultaneously with this technology. There are manyways to view trust, which is relevant in
interpersonal and economic interactions (Corazzini, 1977). Corazzini (1977) defined trust as a
belief in the fulfillment of one’s obligations by others. According to Glynn et al. (1995) “affect-
based trust”, which pertains to one’s judgments about another’s competence and reliability, is
considered to be an emotional bond between individuals. It is possible to define trust as “the
expectation that an individual can have confidence in, or rely on, some quality or attribute
when engaging in a business transaction” (Laeequddin et al., 2012). Due to the current call for
papers in BCT-based research, the four perspectives of satisfaction, relevance, attention and
confidence have yet to be investigated from the perspective of the self-determination theory
and Keller’s ARCSmotivation model (Lavoie et al., 2021) by considering various supply chain
performance aspects such as impact of traceability systems on retailers (Sangal et al., 2022).
It is common for traceability systems to be analyzed in terms of brand- or product-related
outcomes, such as willingness to pay or purchase intention (Creydt and Fischer, 2019; Sangal
et al., 2022).

6. Theoretical and managerial implications
6.1 Theoretical implications
By making both theoretical and practical contributions to the BCT literature, we offer
guidance to managers and policymakers on how to better direct their efforts to enhance its
adoption in supply chains (Creydt and Fischer, 2019; Sangal et al., 2022). This study is the first
attempt to provide a comprehensive list of the enabling factors of BCT adoption in supply
chains, evaluate their effects and map their interdependencies from a theoretical perspective.
Furthermore, it adds to the very limited body of research that has used a multi-theoretic
framework to establish the theoretical context of BCT adoption in SCM (Creydt and Fischer,
2019; Sangal et al., 2022). Assimilation and learning are natural human behaviors in which
people engage because they are enjoyable or interesting. In particular, supply chain
performance is beneficial for a buying firm if it improves the flow of goods from the supplier.
Moreover, it provides managers with useful information regarding interfirm information
sharing and supply chain practices (Pathak et al., 2007).
Strategic alliances are defined as long-term relationships that extend beyond traditional
ones in terms of benefits and are beneficial to both parties. In spite of the development of some
advanced forms of supply chain integration, the results indicate that interorganizational
information integration is not well developed in strategic alliances (Pathak et al., 2007).
Several firms do not invest in technology to integrate information flow, and thus are not
structurally integrated. Partners still share a lot of information using nonintegrated systems.
The success of strategic alliances with limited information flows is perceived to be lower
(Govindan and Hasanagic, 2018).
In addition, our data confirm that IT supply chain applications are used in dynamic
environments (Pathak et al., 2007). The use of IT supply chain applications does not replace
more traditionalmethods of communication, such as faxing, emailing and phone calls. Rather,
they provide partners with new communication tools. Furthermore, it allows for advanced
forms of integration, such as joint planning and goal-setting (Corazzini, 1977; Pathak et al.,
2007). Our results suggest that information flow strategies develop in a trust-based,
interdependent manner. Investing in IT supply chain applications is fueled by high levels of
trust. Partners should invest in traditional media before investing in IT supply chain
applications in order to share information and establish trust.
6.2 Practical implications
Artificial intelligence, big data and the Internet of Things are now widely used in SCM to
improve efficiency (Lavoie et al., 2021). There is a growing interest in leveraging BCT to store
and exchange data. Experts also believe that integration, communication, compatibility and
interoperability are important components of introducing agility in the supply chain. Under
the heading Supply Chain Agility, we should treat these constituents as a single, coherent,
functional element of the supply chain (Lavoie et al., 2021). Experts emphasized the use of
next-generation SaaS platforms that natively offer cross-platform integration capabilities
and provide standard semantics for enterprise business information to support their belief.
Companies can generalize business rules and processes across the supply chain ecosystem
and deploy supply chain processes more quickly with no-code or low-code customizations
based on unified data semantics (Meng et al., 2020).
According to supply chain experts, traceability is an essential component of supply
chains. By reducing the theft and misplacement of goods, traceability creates a value
proposition for the supply chain (Meng et al., 2020). Track-and-Trace systems connect the
dots in supply chains to track goods from source to consumer. As a result, retail firms can
protect their brands against crises such as recalls and counterfeit products with such
systems, which also reduce the risk of mislabeling (Lavoie et al., 2021). Retailers can adopt

progressive procurement strategies to mitigate the risk of changing customer demands by
implementing IoT and blockchain-enabled Track-and-Trace systems (Lavoie et al., 2021). As
a result of the progressive procurement approach, retailers’ profits increase, losses due to
expiration of product shelf life are minimized, and supplier relationships are strengthened
(Meng et al., 2020). Moreover, our study contributes to practice by evaluating and analyzing
the interdependencies of the enablers of BCT adoption in the supply chain. In order to achieve
such adoption, managers and policymakers may use the findings of this study to inform their
decisions and action plans. By gaining knowledge and capabilities, all participants within the
supply chain ecosystem will not only understand the value of the technology, which will also
make it easier to implement BCT in service-oriented sectors such as education, high-tech
firms, tourism and travelling (Biswas and Gupta, 2019; Chin et al., 2021).
7. Conclusions, limitations and future research perspectives
The purpose of this study was to contribute to the literature by assessing the readiness of
retail workers to use BCT to improve supply chain performance. We found that supplier-
based attention, motivation, supplier-based satisfaction, trust, supplier-based relevance to
rawmaterial selection, and confidence with higher levels of trust andmotivation contribute to
supply chain performance. However, due to the broadness of the scope, it could be argued that
the sample was not large enough. Therefore, future researchers could remedy this by
increasing the sample size by including participants from various countries.
BCT adoption in assessing retail worker readiness is a promising area of research with
several avenues for further research. First, we believe this approach to be insightful because
relationships differ based on context – e.g. insurance, shipping and service sector. Supply chain
relationships and performance were measured from the perspective of a single stakeholder. If
generalized, the resultsmay not accurately reflect the real state of the relationship, which points
at the need for future researchers to expand the scope of their investigation. In spite of its
limitations, this study contributes substantially to the literature on BCT adoption in supply
chains. For example, beyond our methodological limitations, we see the need for broader
research to be conducted on BCT in SCM. Future research could be conducted to address the
management of several integrated BCT platforms in multi-actor supply chains. This study
focused on the single-actor supply chain processes such as those enacted by parties in the
supply chain subsequent to buyers, third-party agents and suppliers (Bumblauskas et al., 2020).
We would encourage future researchers to further investigate BCT adoption in supply chains
with regard to a firm’s management commitment and to the cooperation between supply chain
partners on issues such as data sharing, confidentiality and system (Wang et al., 2017).
