Abstract: At present, environmental and competitive pressures urge enterprises to engage in research
and development (R&D) of green products, and a green supply chain has become the main trend in
the sustainable development of enterprises. This study analyzes the optimal operation decisions of a
green supply chain for two manufacturers under different competitive and cooperative relationships,
considering factors such as government subsidies, consumer green preferences, and the impact of
the green information trust. The results show that government subsidies can lead to higher social
welfare when manufacturers have a cooperative relationship, but the optimal choice of subsidies (for
R&D costs or product production costs) depends on the level of competition and the difficulty of
R&D. For the manufacturers, the optimal choice of R&D strategy (individual or joint) and the use of
blockchain technology also depends on the level of difficulty of R&D and the type of government
subsidies. Overall, this study highlights the importance of considering various factors when making
decisions in a green supply chain to achieve the best outcomes for all parties involved.
Keywords: government subsidies; green technology innovation; competing games; blockchain
1. Introduction
With the development of industry, resource and environmental issues have become
a common challenge worldwide, so the concept of environmental protection has been
introduced into supply chains [1]. Green technology innovation is an effective means
to promote the development of green supply chains [2] and affect economic growth and
environmental sustainability [3]. For example, Gree and Haier have continued to launch
green products to enhance their environmental image and promote green development.
However, green technology innovation is characterized by high costs and high risk, which
requires enterprises to pay a lot of design R&D costs and a long capital recovery period.
This limits the enthusiasm of companies in the supply chain to implement green technology
innovation [4].
Therefore, the government has implemented incentives to promote green technology
innovation in supply chains. Typically, governments use subsidies as the main incentive
for green technology innovation. Currently, there are two types of government subsidies
available: green technology innovation subsidies and green product subsidies. The green
technology innovation subsidy is a grant provided by the government to green manufactur-
ers to improve green production technology and produce green products [5]. For example,
in 2012, the European Commission invested €41.8 million in a green campaign for electric
vehicles and provided funding for research and development (R&D) of energy technologies.
In 2019, the UK’s innovation agency provided £20 million in R&D funding to support the
development of advanced low-carbon propulsion in the automotive sector. Green product
subsidies subsidize the manufacture of products, an example being Section 1142 of the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) Energy Incentives for Business, which

creates a special tax credit for two types of plug-in vehicles, namely low-speed electric
vehicles and two- or three-wheeled vehicles.
With the development of economic globalization and changes in the external en-
vironment, environmental pressures are driving companies to engage in green product
research and development, and competition between companies is moving from a single
price competition to a price–greenness competition. The increased costs of green product
research and development are driving supply chain members to cooperate in response to
environmental pressures, while at the same time they are competing to maximize their
own interests, as in the case of Toyota and BMW, which are both jointly developing and
competing in the end product market. If supply chain members join together horizontally
to develop key green technologies, the total R&D costs will be reduced, but the reduction in
customer perceptions of product variation will increase competition between the members.
Obviously, under the price–greenness competition, the competitive game among supply
chain members and the choice of R&D model are of great practical significance for the
successful implementation of green supply chain management. The competitive strategic
advantages of enterprises promote the management of green supply chains, leading to
better performance. Enterprises are now pursuing the goal of sustainable development
and have established strategic alliances to implement green supply chain management
practices [6]. For example, the automotive companies YUDO and FAW have collaborated
to jointly develop new energy vehicles. Toyota has collaborated with Panasonic to produce
more environmentally friendly batteries. At the same time, due to information asymmetry,
consumers may not be aware of the actual greenness of products and suspect that manu-
facturers’ green products are not as “green” as they portray them to be [7]. Therefore, in
recent years, some companies have used blockchain technology to improve the traceability
of information and increase consumer confidence in their products: for example, by using
blockchain technology, IKEA can guarantee that the entire process is controlled, and that
the final product is indeed made from a specific wood [8]. When manufacturers produce
and distribute green products, if blockchain technology is applied to the supply chain,
downstream agents (retailers and consumers) can also have access to valuable and reliable
product information, increasing trust in the product [9].
In recent years, scholars have conducted extensive research on government subsidy
approaches in supply chains. Specifically, product substitution, retail competition and
demand uncertainty are considered in a three-tier supply chain model consisting of manu-
facturers, retailers, and consumers to address the question of who needs to be subsidized in
the supply chain [10]. Two manufacturers with different green technologies competing that
is sensitive to both price and pollution are also considered, a green target level for improv-
ing environmental quality is discussed, and an appropriate subsidy rate is designed [11].
In addition, Meng et al. considered three types of innovation subsidy scenarios and con-
cluded that, when the government subsidizes manufacturers, intra-supply chain incentives
can motivate the entire supply chain to implement green innovations [12]. In terms of
corporate R&D models, Fu et al. constructs four game models based on the relationship
between horizontal competitive cooperation among automakers and R&D models [13].
Yang et al. developed a game model consisting of a government and two competing firms
and concluded that joint R&D should be conducted when R&D is more difficult, while
individual R&D should be conducted when the profits from increased market size are
relatively large [14]. Moreover, two companies may fall into a prisoner’s dilemma when
they reach the equilibrium of improving technology. With the development of the Internet,
a lot of research has also been done on the strategy of using blockchain in the supply chain:
for example, blockchain technology can reduce business risks and transaction costs, but
blockchain requires initial implementation investment and variable costs, so the conditions
and stochastic situations where blockchain is not worth implementing are identified [15].
Niu et al. studied the impact of blockchain on aggregate and customer surplus and found
that blockchain adoption always benefits customers and society; retailers have an incentive
to participate in blockchain when competition from manufacturers is mild and demand
Sustainability 2023, 15, 3633 3 of 27
variance is low [16]. Dong et al. found that core companies should not establish their own
original channels when their primary business is selling high-cost products or when the
marginal cost of blockchain implementation is large enough [17].
However, most of these studies do not consider the choice of companies’ R&D strate-
gies, blockchain usage strategies and the choice of government subsidy options under
different competing environments. The main research questions addressed in this study
are as follows:
• How do consumers’ preferences for green products and the difficulty of research and
development affect product pricing and product greenness?
• How do government technology subsidies and product subsidies work in different
competition and cooperation relationships between enterprises? Which decision
model is more beneficial to the maximization of social welfare?
• How do the government’s product subsidies and technology subsidies for enterprises
affect the green degree of products and enterprise profits under different R&D models?
Does R&D difficulty play a role?
• In what kind of enterprise relationship is blockchain easier to apply?
Therefore, this paper synthesizes the impact of government subsidy strategies and the
choice of different strategies of enterprises on green technology innovation and provides
a theoretical research framework for the choice of government subsidy strategy and the
choice of enterprise R&D model.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a literature
review. Section 3 describes the basic model setup. Section 4 solves the model. Section 5 ex-
plores the impact of government subsidy strategies and firms’ choices of different strategies
on green technology innovation. After the detailed numerical study in Section 6, Section 7
concludes the paper.
2. Literature Review
The application of blockchain technology, inter-firm competition and cooperative R&D
and green technology innovation subsidy mechanisms have been extensively studied in
supply chain management. This section reviews and summarizes the literature related to
blockchain technology, inter-firm competition and cooperative R&D and green technology
innovation subsidy mechanisms and the application of game theory.
2.1. Green Technology Innovation Subsidy
In the study of subsidy strategies, scholars’ research mainly focuses on the study of
different subsidy strategies, and some scholars have discussed which of these two subsidy
policies has a greater impact on social welfare [18]. At the same time, some research
results show that direct government subsidies are beneficial to enterprises in the short
term but hinder the long-term innovation performance of enterprises. [19]. Bian et al.
used a game theory approach to compare product subsidies and technology subsidies to
two environmental subsidy policies and found that yield subsidies yielded higher social
welfare compared to technology subsidies [20]. For an evolving industry, social welfare
always improves as the industry grows when the government provides subsidies for green
technology development [21]. Some scholars have also established a model based on
differential game to explore the optimal production and subsidy rates considering the
different objectives of the maximization of government social welfare and the maximization
of government utility [22]. Public R&D subsidies are a commonly adopted policy tool
to promote exploratory innovation in firms and encourage new knowledge learning [23].
When there is a risk of R&D failure, under the same subsidy expenditure conditions, some
scholars have also discussed which subsidy method can maximize social welfare [24].
In addition to firms in general, there are some studies on the impact of government
R&D subsidies on green innovation in energy-intensive firms [25]. According to Lee
et al.’s studies of market economies that consider environmental factors, the presence of
publicly owned firms has encouraged the government to adopt subsidy policies [26]. In
Sustainability 2023, 15, 3633 4 of 27
the new energy vehicle industry, the Chinese government closely monitors and provides
billions in R&D subsidies to help new energy vehicle companies research their common
technologies [27]. Dong finds that R&D subsidies can change the direction of technology
and thus affect environmental quality, and that different types of R&D subsidies affect the
direction of technological change and environmental quality in different ways [28]. Cristian
et al. found that increasing R&D subsidies slightly reduces prices [29]. Renewable energy
investments are important for achieving green development, but their heavy reliance on
government subsidies leads to financial constraints and market inefficiencies that hinder
their sustainable development [30].
2.2. Inter-Firm Competition and Cooperative R&D
The existing literature usually assumes that joint R&D is better while ignoring the pos-
itive effects of individual R&D. Ishikawa and Shibata. explored the impact of asymmetric
spillovers on R&D investments in oligopolistic markets. R&D was found to be affected by
spillovers from competitors, and an increase in the degree of market competitiveness can
generate social preference for R&D competition [31]. Esenduran et al. developed a Cournot
competition model between original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and independent
remanufacturer (IR) models to investigate the impact of retraction regulation and provide
insights into its effectiveness [32]. As technology advances and information technology
becomes more prevalent, product life cycles shorten, R&D costs and product development
risks rise, and more and more firms choose to collaborate with other firms in R&D to ensure
competitive advantage [33]. However, Minshall et al. found that the shift from traditional
in-house R&D to collaborative R&D requires companies to adopt a new mindset and show
a strong motivation for change [34]. Weber et al. examined the impact of the intensity of
collaboration with different types of partners on corporate innovation. The results show
that company cooperation is generally beneficial [35]. Collaboration in concept and product
development mainly increases the innovation capacity of the company, while collaboration
in the implementation phase mainly increases the innovation success of the company. With
respect to the type of collaboration, vertical, horizontal and institutional collaboration sig-
nificantly increased the innovation capacity and success of the firm. Young et al. explored
the impact of collaboration on R&D productivity in the innovation process and showed
that firms which collaborate with competitors in R&D during the value creation phase have
relatively higher R&D productivity than those that do not collaborate [36]. Carree et al.
modeled the breadth of the optimal partnership portfolio and found that small and low
R&D-intensive companies benefit more from starting an R&D partnership compared to
large and/or R&D-intensive companies [37]. Fan et al. considered an electric vehicle supply
chain consisting of a battery supplier, a well-known brand manufacturer (manufacturer A),
and a generic brand manufacturer (manufacturer B), and examined the non-collaboration
strategy, the collaboration strategy between the battery supplier and manufacturer A, and
the collaboration strategy between the battery supplier and manufacturer B. It was found
that the vertical collaboration strategy did not always improve the overall profitability of
the supply chain capability [38].
In recent years, environmental issues have received much attention and many schol-
ars have started to study competitive cooperation in green R&D activities. Zhang et al.
established an oligopoly model to study the green and quality investment choices of two
competing companies with different product quality. They found that no company decides
to make green investment when green investment and quality investment are substitutes,
while when green investment and quality investment are complements, whether a company
makes green investment depends on the efficiency of green investment [39]. Zhang et al.
examined the dynamics of green innovation by developing a differential game model and
found that, in the non-cooperative model, the emissions and profits of the hitchhiking
manufacturer are lower than those of the innovative manufacturer, and, in the cooper-
ative model, the green manufacturer’s innovation increases while the green supplier’s
innovation decreases [40]. Chen et al. explored the green R&D cooperation behavior of
Sustainability 2023, 15, 3633 5 of 27
companies in dual supply chains and found that the improvement of R&D cooperation
on companies’ economic performance depends mainly on the level of companies’ own
green contribution [41]. Dai et al. analyzed two typical cooperative behaviors of two chain
members through a game-theoretic approach, both of which are interested in forming R&D
cooperation to achieve superior energy-saving performance in their products. Green inno-
vation cooperation between downstream companies and upstream suppliers can achieve
higher environmental benefits [42].
2.3. Application of Blockchain Technology
The application of blockchain technology is extensive. For example, some studies have
found that blockchain can be used to store pseudonym transaction records in untrusted
environments [43]. We classify the current application of blockchain technology in the
supply chain into three broad areas: (1) The value of blockchain in the supply chain and
the ways to achieve it. Balan et al. identified the key implementation guidelines and
issues of blockchain in supply chain management by exploring the needs of blockchain
in the industry 4.0 supply chain management environment from the perspective of big
data [44]. Some scholars have found that the shipping, manufacturing, finance, technology,
energy, healthcare, e-commerce, education, agriculture and food industries can be success-
fully transformed by applying blockchain technology to enhance visibility and optimize
business process management. [45]. Piera et al. proposed an integrated three-tier revis-
iting framework for designing circular blockchain platforms and highlighted the role of
blockchain as a technological capability to improve the control of waste flows and product
return management activities [46]. Wamba et al. developed and tested a model in two
countries, India and the United States. The findings highlight the importance of supply
chain transparency and blockchain transparency, both of which are important prerequisites
for supply chain performance [47]. It is shown that blockchain applications can improve
supply chain performance. (2) Research content and methods for blockchain adoption in
supply chains. Lim et al. reviewed publications related to blockchain-based supply chains
between 2017 and 2020, addressing the value of blockchain in supply chains [48]. Liu et al.
considered the goodwill of traceability and product freshness supported using blockchain
when selling fresh food on e-commerce platforms, exploring whether e-platforms choose
to resell or broker fresh food [49]. Competition between the dual channels was found to
potentially lead to higher prices for fresh foods and incentivize companies to invest more in
product freshness and blockchain-enabled traceability goodwill. Kohler and Massimo used
a technology assessment framework to analyze the technologies invested in blockchain in
the food supply chain, and the results indicated that, while blockchain-based technologies
are expected to have a variety of impacts, only some impacts, such as increased trans-
parency, traceability and trust, can be directly attributed to blockchain elements [50]. In
addition, blockchain technology has important applications in cross-border e-commerce
supply chains, and its contributions are mainly concentrated on cross-border e-commerce
platforms, supply chain operation, data governance and information management [51].
(3) Blockchain Enables Green Supply Chains. Xu et al. explored the best strategies for
pricing and “green” investments in green products under different government subsidies
and explored the conditions for adopting blockchain technology [9]. Bai et al. proposed a
green data supply chain and trust management was developed to record the trust values of
sensors in the blockchain [52]. Rane et al. discussed the ranking of critical success factors
using the advantages of blockchain and internet of things (IoT) technologies using decision
experiments and evaluation lab methods and found that collaboration with buyers to
implement green initiatives is most important for green supply chains [53]. Bag et al. used
an integrated fuzzy decision-making test and evaluation lab approach to analyze causality
and prioritize barriers to the adoption of blockchain technology in green supply chain
management [54]. Liu et al. modeled and analyzed the benefits of producers and retailers
before and after using big data and blockchain and concluded that the use of big data and
blockchain can reap more benefits when the total investment cost paid by producers and
Sustainability 2023, 15, 3633 6 of 27
retailers is within a certain range [55]. We summarize the differences between these studies
and this work from multiple dimensions in Table 1.

In summary, there are many studies on the application of blockchain technology in
supply chains and government green R&D subsidy strategies, but few scholars have con-
sidered the relationship and choice between the competition and cooperation of companies
in the context of blockchain technology and under the influence of government subsidy
strategies. Therefore, this paper considers the effects of blockchain technology application
platforms, government R&D subsidies, consumer green trust and consumer preferences,
and analyzes the effects of blockchain technology application and different R&D models
on social welfare and green R&D strategies by comparing manufacturers’ non-cooperation
and cooperation before and after blockchain technology application, R&D models and gov-
ernment subsidy strategies in sixteen contexts, so as to provide a basis for blockchain. The
impact of blockchain technology application and different R&D models on social welfare
and green R&D strategies is analyzed to provide targeted suggestions for governmental
low-carbon subsidies in the context of blockchain technology.
3. Problem Description and Basic Assumptions
3.1. Symbol Description
The following are the parameters used in our model, as shown in Table 2
3.2. Problem Description
Cooperative research and development among competing manufacturers has become
a common practice in the industry because joint research efforts avoid the duplication of re-
search and development activities and allow learning through sharing knowledge, thereby
reducing research and development costs through sharing investment. Since using different
components is an important way for companies to differentiate their products, it is costly
to jointly develop a component, because customers may think that the product difference is
low. For example, BMW is worried that when it forms a research and development alliance
with DaimlerChrysler to jointly develop a dual-mode hybrid drive system, it will have a
small difference from DaimlerChrysler and General Motors. Therefore, the formation of a
research and development alliance may not always be conducive to competition. In some
cases, even if the competing companies are supply chain partners, they may choose to carry
out their research and development activities independently in order to develop different
components. In this paper, we study a two-stage supply chain with two manufacturers Mi
(i = 1, 2) and one retailer R. Both manufacturers produce green products with competition
in price and greenness, and products are substitutable. The government determines green
technology subsidy coefficient µ or product subsidy coefficient θ for the manufacturer
Sustainability 2023, 15, 3633 7 of 27
with the decision objective of maximizing the total social welfare level. The manufacturer
Mi (i = 1, 2) supplies retailer R at wholesale price wi and the retailer sells the product at
retail price Pi. Consumers decide their demand for product i based on its greenness ei and
price Pi.

Suppose the market demand function for two substitutable products is
di = α− pi
1−γ + γ

1−γ (i ∈ {1, 2}, j = 3− i). Since consumers have green preferences, the
following demand function di = α− pi

is constructed when
there is price and greenness competition, and this demand function reflects that consumers’
green preferences are positively related to product demand. The smaller the difference
between two products perceived by consumers and the stronger the substitutability, the
greater the γ, i.e., the more intense the competition between the two products.
For green technology innovation, the two manufacturers can develop independently
or jointly. When jointly conducting R&D, the two products have the same greenness e0,
and consumers perceive less product differentiation and more substitutability, and the
competition between the two products becomes more intense. Using χ to represent the
increased competition between products due to joint R&D, the market demand function of
the two products when jointly conducting R&D is di = α− pi

There is horizontal non-cooperation or cooperation between the two manufacturers:
in the horizontal non-cooperation model, the two manufacturers seek to maximize their
respective returns; in the horizontal cooperation model, the two manufacturers seek to
maximize their overall returns. In addition, in the cooperative R&D strategy, the product
greenness is jointly determined by the two manufacturers, and, in the individual R&D
strategy, the product greenness is determined by the two manufacturers separately.
Governments invest in building blockchain platforms and manufacturers improve
their green credentials and market demand by purchasing blockchain technology. At the
same time, the government encourages manufacturers through different forms of subsidies.
The government’s technical subsidies to manufacturers are expressed as µk (e2
1+e2
2)
2 , and the
production subsidies are expressed as θ(d1 + d2). The government implements TS or PS
for manufacturers, and monitors manufacturers greenly through the blockchain platform.
Sustainability 2023, 15, 3633 8 of 27
Consumers enhance green trust through blockchain technology for product traceability.
Consumer low-carbon preferences and green trust affect the market demand for low-carbon
products. Enterprises need to weigh the relationship between the blockchain platform
application cost and profit and make optimal blockchain application decisions and R&D
strategies to maximize the profit of manufacturers. The government needs to weigh the
relationship between greenness and social welfare and decide on the subsidy method to
maximize social profit.
Based on the competing relationships, R&D patterns and government subsidy strate-
gies of manufacturers before and after the application of blockchain technology, sixteen
game strategies were formed, as shown in Table 3. The model of this paper is shown
in Figure 1.

Because

Let

Putting Equation (10) into Equations (5), (7) and (8), we obtain:

4.2. Strategy 2
The decision sequence of strategy 2 is as follows: first, the government determines
its technology subsidy coefficient based on maximizing social welfare; secondly, two
manufacturers decide on joint or individual R&D, based on maximizing total revenue
to determine the common greenness of products e0; the R&D cost of manufacturer 1 is
λ(1− µ)

determine the wholesale price based on maximizing their respective revenue. In the end,
the retailer determines the retail prices of the two products based on maximizing its own
revenue. The game model can be expressed as

The decision sequence of strategy 4 is thus: first, the government determines its tech-
nology subsidy coefficient based on social welfare maximization; then, two manufacturers
jointly conduct R&D, set the same greenness for both products based on the overall revenue
maximization e0, manufacturer 1 and manufacturer 2 share the R&D cost, and then each
sets its respective wholesale price; finally, retailers decide the retail price of both products

The difference between Strategies 5–8 and Strategies 1–4 is that Strategies 5–8 transform
the technology R&D subsidy µ into product subsidy θ. Strategies 9–16 introduce blockchain
technology compared to Strategies 1–8, making the level of consumer green trust η = 1,
while increasing the cost of building the blockchain for the government I and the cost of
using the blockchain for manufacturers ϕ. The specific results are shown in the table below.
The results of the model are shown in Table 4.

5. Analysis of Results
Proposition 1. The R&D coefficient k has a negative impact on social welfare, greenness and the
price of green products.
Proposition 2. Green preferences τ have a positive effect on social welfare, greenness and the price
of green products.
Proposition 3. When the supply chain does not adopt blockchain technology, consumer green trust
η has a positive impact on social welfare, greenness and the price of green products; when the supply
chain adopts blockchain technology, consumers can accurately know the greenness information of
low-carbon products, and the green trust coefficient η = 1, the impact of consumer green trust η on
social welfare, and the greenness and selling price of green products reach the maximum.
Proposition 4. Substitutability γ has a positive effect on social welfare and greenness; the effect of
substitutability γ on the price of green products is related to the R&D coefficient k; when the R&D
coefficient k (k < η2τ2(3−2γ)2
2(2−γ)2 ) is small, substitutability γ has a positive effect on the selling price of
green products; otherwise it has a negative effect.
Proposition 5. The degree of competition χ has a positive effect on social welfare and greenness,
and the effect of the degree of competition χ on the price of green products is related to the R&D
coefficient. When the R&D coefficient k (k < η2τ2(3−2χγ)2
2(2−χγ)2 ) is small, the degree of competition χ has
a positive effect on the price of green products; otherwise it has a negative effect.
Conclusion 1. Social welfare, greenness and selling price decrease as R&D difficulty increases and
increase as consumer green preferences increase.
Since green technology innovation is characterized by high costs and long lead times,
manufacturers may not increase the price of their products when green R&D is difficult,
but rather invest less in green R&D, sell fewer green products, and reduce the price of
green products to improve product competitiveness, while the degree of competition
among products and increased substitutability will further reduce prices. Meanwhile,
according to a consumer survey, 80% of consumers are willing to pay extra to buy low-
carbon products (Zhang et al., 2020). Therefore, products with low greenness have difficulty
meeting the green demand of consumers and will have a negative impact on social welfare.
To improve social welfare the government should increase subsidies to enterprises and
promote green R&D.
Proposition 6. When two firms choose their respective R&D in competition, the output subsidy is
always the optimal choice for the government.
Proposition 7. When manufacturers are not in cooperation and choose joint R&D, when χγ < 0.5,
or γχ > 0.5 and k > η2τ2(3−2χγ)χ2γ2
(2−χγ)2(1−χγ)2 ), PS is the optimal choice for the government. Otherwise,
when η2τ2(3−2χγ)2
2(2−χγ)2 < k < η2τ2(3−2χγ)χ2γ2
(2−χγ)2(1−χγ)2 , TS is the optimal choice for the government.
Proposition 8. When manufacturers are in cooperation and choose individual R&D, PS is always
the optimal choice for the government.
Proposition 9. When manufacturers are in cooperation and choose joint R&D, PS is always the
optimal choice for the government.
Proposition 10. When manufacturers are not in cooperation and choose individual R&D, PS is
always the optimal choice for the government.
Sustainability 2023, 15, 3633 15 of 27
Proposition 11. When manufacturers are not in cooperation and choose joint R&D, when
χγ < 0.5, or γχ > 0.5 and k > τ2(3−2χγ)χ2γ2
(2−χγ)2(1−χγ)2 , PS is always the optimal choice for the government.
Otherwise, when τ2(3−2χγ)
(2−χγ)2 < k < τ2(3−2χγ)χ2γ2
(2−χγ)2(1−χγ)2 , TS is the optimal choice for the government.
Proposition 12. When manufacturers are in cooperation and choose individual R&D, PS is the
optimal choice for the government.
Proposition 13. When manufacturers are in cooperation and choose joint R&D, PS is the optimal
choice for the government.
Conclusion 2. When manufacturers are in cooperation, PS can help the government obtain
higher social welfare. If manufacturers are not in cooperation and choose joint R&D, when
τ2(3−2χγ)
(2−χγ)2 < k < τ2(3−2χγ)χ2γ2
(2−χγ)2(1−χγ)2 and γχ > 0.5, the government can obtain higher social welfare
by choosing TS.
The government welfare consists of a combination of consumer surplus, manufacturer
profits and subsidy expenditures. Companies will tend to reduce the selling price of
their products in a non-cooperation relationship. Furthermore, the increase in product
substitutability and the perceived intensity of competition received by consumers will
further reduce the selling price of their products, ultimately leading to an increase in
product demand and consumer surplus. Companies reduce product costs through joint
R&D, which ultimately leads to increased profits for manufacturers. The increase in
demand causes the government to favor technology subsidies over PS which both reduce
subsidy expenditures, so the government can obtain higher social welfare by choosing TS in
this case.
Proposition 14. PS can obtain higher greenness when manufacturers are not in cooperation and
choose individual R&D.
Proposition 15. When manufacturers are not in cooperation and choose joint R&D, PS achieves
a higher degree of greenness when 0 < γχ < 1−
√
2
2 . When 1−
√
2
2 < γχ < 0.5, TS achieves a
higher degree of greenness if k > 2τ2η2(3−2χγ)(1−χγ)χγ
(2−χγ)2(4χγ−2χ2γ2−1)
. When γχ > 0.5, the TS achieves a higher
degree of greenness if k > τ2η2(3−2γχ)
(2−γχ)2 .
Proposition 16. PS can obtain a higher degree of greenness when manufacturers are in cooperation
and whether or not they opts for joint R&D.
Proposition 17. PS can obtain a higher degree of greenness when manufacturers are not in
cooperation and choose individual R&D.
Proposition 18. In the blockchain context, when manufacturers are not in cooperation and
choose joint R&D, PS achieves a higher degree of greenness when 0 < γχ < 1−
√

2 . When
1−
√

(2−χγ)2(4χγ−2χ2γ2−1)
, or when γχ > 0.5 and k > τ2(3−2γχ)
(2−γχ)2 , TS
can obtain higher greenness.
Proposition 19. PS can obtain a higher degree of greenness when manufacturers are in cooperation
and choose individual R&D.
Proposition 20. PS can obtain a higher degree of greenness when manufacturers are in cooperation
and choose joint R&D.
Sustainability 2023, 15, 3633 16 of 27
Conclusion 3. When manufacturers choose individual R&D, PS can help the government achieve
a higher degree of greenness. When manufacturers are not in cooperation and choose joint R&D, if
γχ > 0.5 and k > τ2η2(3−2γχ)
(2−γχ)2 , or 1−
√
2
2 < γχ < 0.5 and k > 2τ2η2(3−2χγ)(1−χγ)χγ
(2−χγ)2(4χγ−2χ2γ2−1)
), TS can
achieve higher greenness.
Enterprises will reduce the selling price of products under a competitive relationship;
product substitutability and consumers’ perceived increase in the intensity of competition
will further reduce the selling price of products, while the increased difficulty of green R&D
will prompt enterprises to reduce product costs through joint R&D, while the government
will incentivize enterprises to continue green R&D through technology subsidies. Therefore,
the government can obtain higher greenness by choosing technology subsidies in this case.

When the government chooses TS, it can stimulate manufacturers to conduct green
R&D. To reduce R&D costs, manufacturers will actively seek to cooperate with other
manufacturers in R&D to obtain higher profits. When the government chooses PS, whether
manufacturers choose individual R&D or joint R&D is related to the difficulty of R&D.
When the difficulty of R&D is high, manufacturers will choose joint R&D to reduce the cost;
when the difficulty of R&D is low, if they continue to choose joint R&D, the transaction cost
brought will be greater than the cost reduced by joint R&D, so manufacturers will choose
individual R&D.

When the government chooses PS, the relatively high greenness of products becomes
the common knowledge of consumers. The role of blockchain becomes less obvious,
and manufacturers do not use blockchain to increase their profits. When the government
chooses TS, it can stimulate manufacturers to conduct green R&D. Meanwhile, the reduction
in R&D difficulty will significantly improve the greenness of products, so enterprises are
willing to use the blockchain platform to satisfy the green trust of consumers and gain
higher profits. When R&D is difficult, manufacturers may not invest all the subsidies in
Sustainability 2023, 15, 3633 18 of 27
technology R&D, thus leading to a decrease in product greenness and a reluctance to use
the blockchain platform.
6. Analysis of Results
In order to verify the above properties and conclusions, we use matlab 2021a software
for digital simulation. The model is analyzed below using arithmetic examples.
In Figure 2, taking α = 5, c = 3, τ = 0.45, η = 0.45, ϕ = 1, χ = 0.9, it can be
seen that, when k is small (k < τ2η2(3−2γ)2
(2−γχ)2 ), the price of the green product increases
as product substitutability increases, and when k is large (k > τ2η2(3−2γ)2
(2−γχ)2 ) the price of
the green product decreases as product substitutability increases. In Figure 3, taking
α = 5, c = 3, τ = 0.5, η = 0.5, ϕ = 1, γ = 0.5, it can be seen that the consumer’s
perceived level of competition has the same effect on the price of the green product as
substitutability. The impact of R&D difficulty on the price of green products is related to
the substitutability and competitiveness of products. Because green technology innovation
has the characteristics of high cost and long cycle, when green research and development
is difficult, manufacturers may not increase the price of products, but instead reduce
investment in green research and development, sell products with low green degrees, and
reduce the price of green products to improve the competitiveness of products, while the
increase in competition and substitutability between products will further reduce the price.

In Figure 4, taking 10, 3, 0.7, 0.7, 0.5, 0.7,c Iα τ η ϕ γ χ= = = = = = =2, =0.7 , 
there is a roughly negative relationship between R&D difficulty and social welfare. When 
manufacturing chooses non-cooperation and joint R&D, 0.49χγ = , the social welfare 
obtained from PS is constantly greater than that obtained from TS. In Figure 5, the social 
welfare obtained from PS is greater than that obtained from TS when 0.64χγ =
0.705k＞  is used, and the social welfare obtained from TS is greater than that obtained 
from PS when 0.705k0.6＜ ＜ is used. Enterprises reduce product costs through 
joint research and development, which ultimately leads to increased profits for 
manufacturers. The increase in demand leads the government to prefer technology 
subsidies rather than production subsidies, which reduces its subsidy expenditure. 
Therefore, in this case, the government can choose technology subsidies to obtain higher 
social welfare.

In Figure 11, taking α = 5, c = 3, τ = 0.5, η = 0.5, ϕ = 0.2, γ = 0.35, χ = 0.35,
0.25 < k < 0.36, the platform can obtain a higher profit without using blockchain tech-
nology; when k > 0.36, it can obtain a higher profit using blockchain technology. In
Figure 12, taking α = 5, c = 3, τ = 0.5, η = 0.5, ϕ = 0.2, γ = 0.35, χ = 0.35. When
0.7 < k < 0.74, higher profits can be obtained by using blockchain technology; when
k > 0.74, higher profits can be obtained by not using blockchain technology. In Figure 13,
taking α = 5, c = 3, τ = 0.5, η = 0.5, ϕ = 1, γ = 0.7, χ = 0.7, it can be seen that the profit
gained by the firm without using blockchain is constantly greater than the profit gained by
using blockchain when the government chooses PS. This is because the relatively high green
degree of products becomes the common knowledge of consumers when the production
subsidies are given, and the role of blockchain becomes less obvious. Enterprises do not
use blockchain to improve profits. When the government subsidizes technology, it can
stimulate enterprises to carry out green research and development, and the reduction in the
difficulty of research and development will greatly improve the green degree of products.
Therefore, enterprises are willing to use the blockchain platform to meet the green trust of
consumers and obtain higher profits. When research and development is difficult, enter-
prises may not invest all subsidies in technology research and development, thus reducing
the green degree of products and the willingness to use the blockchain platform.

7. Conclusions 
Most of the current research on cooperation issues and R&D approaches in low-
carbon supply chains is in the context of taxation or subsidies. Therefore, this study 
considers the application of blockchain in the supply chain. Sixteen decision models were 
constructed, and comparative analysis was conducted. In addition, the impact of product 
substitutability and consumer-perceived competitive intensity on the price of green 
products under the joint R&D model was analyzed. The results were obtained by 
theoretical analysis and validated by numerical analysis. 
(1) This study has different findings from the literature regarding the effect of the R&D 
difficulty coefficient. Mohsin et al. found that increased R&D difficulty of green 
products decreases the selling price of products [57]; Koh et al. showed that increased 
product substitutability decreases the selling price of products [58]. However, we 
demonstrated that increased difficulty in green product R&D reduces product selling 
prices but decreases social welfare. Furthermore, when R&D is less difficult, green 
product prices increase with the degree of product substitutability or with the 
intensity of competition perceived by consumers. 
(2) Regarding the government’s choice of subsidies to obtain higher social welfare, Bian 
et al. indicated that output subsidies can obtain higher social welfare [20]. However, 
the difficulty of R&D and the intensity of competition of the product are not 
considered. In contrast, this paper proposes that the government chooses output 
subsidies for social welfare optimization and technology subsidies for carbon 
emission reduction rate optimization when firms with high R&D difficulty and 
competitive intensity choose co-R&D in competition. 
(3) Regarding which R&D method manufacturers choose to obtain higher profits, Zhou 
et al. stated that joint R&D can obtain higher social welfare. However, the difficulty 
of R&D and the intensity of competition of the product are not considered. When the 
government subsidizes the technology to the firms, joint R&D can gain higher profits 
compared to the firms’ own R&D; under the output subsidy, independent R&D can 
gain higher profits when the R&D is less difficult, and joint R&D can gain higher 
profits when the R&D is more difficult. 
(4) Extending the decision model by including government R&D blockchain for 
manufacturers to use blockchain for a fee. When the government subsidizes output, 
firms can earn higher profits without blockchain compared to using blockchain; 
Under the technology subsidies, firms can earn higher profits by using blockchain 
for a fee when R&D is less difficult but can earn higher profits without blockchain 
when R&D is more difficult.

This study has the following key contributions. In theory, first of all, our research
expands the existing literature on supply chain horizontal cooperation by observing the
impact of existing government subsidies on manufacturers’ strategic and operational
decisions, as well as their environmental and economic performance. This is different
from most studies in the existing literature that mainly focus on the vertical supply chain
cooperation of carbon emission reduction. Secondly, our research discussed the green
information trust of consumers and introduced blockchain technology to solve it, which
is a supplement to the existing literature. In terms of methodology, our research has
demonstrated this game theory method by applying non-cooperative game and cooperative
game to study pure competition and cooperative relationship respectively, and expanded
the existing cooperative literature by showing how to use this game theory method to
explore the business decisions and performance of cooperative companies and different
market environments.
This study has several limitations. First, the study model is limited to a low-carbon
supply chain consisting of two green manufacturers. In practice, multiple manufacturers
can collaborate (including non-green manufacturers), and there may be interactions be-
tween these relationships through competition between manufacturers and government
concerns about overall profit and carbon reduction rates, so the government’s approach to
subsidizing multiple manufacturers needs to be further explored. There is still some work
to be done in the future. Second, this study only analyzes the optimal strategy in terms of
subsidy approach, R&D approach, competing relationships, and whether to use blockchain
in a two-by-two comparison. Further research can consider multiple strategies optimally
rather than two. In addition, information asymmetry is more common in practice and may
distort the decision making of supply chain parties. Further exploration of information
asymmetry will make the findings of studies such as subsidy methods and competing
relationships more realistic and meaningful.
