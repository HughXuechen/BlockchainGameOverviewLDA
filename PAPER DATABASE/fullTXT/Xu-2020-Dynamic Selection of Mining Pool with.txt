Abstract—In a PoW-based blockchain network, miners partic-
ipate in a block-discovery racing game for financial incentives. As
the total computing power becomes overwhelming, miners join in
the mining pool which combines the scattered computing power
to win a stable profit. Miners in the same mining pool work as a
team and once they successfully mine a valid block, mining pool
plays a role in distributing the payoff to miners according to
its reward sharing mechanism. Specifically, two main reward
sharing strategies: Pay-Per-Share (PPS) and Pay-Per-Last-N-
Share (PPLNS) are considered. In the mining system model, a
miner can choose to join a pool and adapt the selection for
improving the expected reward. And we formulate the dynamic
pool selection problem as an evolutionary game. We consider the
required hash rate, network delay and reward sharing strategy as
the main factors which affect the choice of miners. Evolutionary
stable equilibrium (ESS) is considered to be the solution, and we
conduct theoretical analysis on the existence and stability of the
ESS for a case of two mining pools. A low complexity distributed
algorithm is proposed for miners to reach the equilibrium.
Numerical results show the evolution of miners and demonstrate
the theoretical findings of our study.

I. INTRODUCTION
Blockchain network [1] is distinguished by its character-
istics of tamper proof, traceability and public accessibility,
in which the consensus mechanism ensures synchronization.
In the consensus mechanism proposed by Nakamoto, miners
participate in a cryptographic block-discovery racing game, the
so-called Proof of Work (PoW) scheme [2], [3]. By constantly
performing hash calculations, the miners who first solve the
puzzle will be rewarded by digital currency and transaction
fee. This mechanism drives the miners to join in the blockchain
network spontaneously to maintain the blockchain security.
Winning miners pack the transactions into the block according
to the transaction fee, and then broadcast to the entire network.
For a miner, the possibility of eventually winning a mining
race depends on the ratio of one’s own hash rate to the
total computing power of the entire network. As the total
hash rate of blockchain becomes overwhelming, it is almost
impossible to successfully dig blocks by means of separate

mining [4]. Thus, the mining pool appears in order to combine
the scattered computing power for increasing the probability
of winning a PoW competition. Once mining pool generates
a block, it shares rewards with miners and several reward
sharing strategies can be adopted [5]. Specifically, we consider
two commonly used strategies: PPS and PPLNS. For mining
pool using PPS strategy, it can estimate how many rewards
the miners’ computing power is expected to get in advance,
and the pool pays the profit directly to miners according to
this quantity [6]. While the fluctuations of the mining output
are undertaken by mining pools with high service fees, while
miners’ rewards are relatively stable. Different with PPS, the
PPLNS mechanism pays revenue based on the last N shares,
which means that the more hash power you provide, the more
shares you will devote, and the more rewards you will get. On
the other words, if the mining pool fails to find a block, then
each miner in this pool will have no income.
When faced with various sharing strategies, how to select
the mining pool to maximize their own income is a issue that
all miners must consider. The miners choose which mining
pool to join in according to the reward sharing strategy of
the pool. Meanwhile, the mining electricity fee will affect the
choice of miners. Since mining is full of uncertainties, the
benefits of a mining pool are dynamically changing, causing
fluctuation in the proportion of miners in the pool.
Currently, only few work considered this issue from differ-
ent aspects. For instances, in [7], miners select a mining pool
according to the pool’s hash rate. Reward sharing strategies are
introduced and compared in [8]. In [9], a sustainable reward
mechanism which is affected by transaction fee is proposed.
The economics of Bitcoin transaction fees are discussed in
[10]. However, the pool selection taking into account different
reward sharing strategies has not been considered.
In this work, we consider the issue of selecting mining
pools with different reward sharing strategies. We assume
that the miners are with bounded rationality and can adapt
their pool selection strategies according to received rewards.
Note that the required hash rate by a particular pool and the
Internet delay also affects the choice of miners. Accordingly,
the problem of pool selection is formulated as an evolutionary
game, where the miners are the players and the pool selection

is the strategy. Evolutionary stable strategy is considered to be
the solution of this game. And we perform theoretical analysis
on the existence and stability of the ESS for a special case of
two mining pools. A low complexity algorithm is proposed
to achieve the equilibrium. And simulations are performed to
verity the proposed schemes.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
introduces our system model which is composed of mining
pool model. In Section III, we formulate our problem as an
evolutionary model and study a case of two mining pools.
Section IV presents our numerical results and theoretical
analysis. Finally, we conclude our study in Section V.
II. SYSTEM MODEL AND ASSUMPTIONS
A. Mining Pool Model
In the blockchain network using PoW, miners choose to
join in mining pools for stable financial incentives. We assume
that the process of solving crypto-puzzle is ASIC-resistant and
miners have roughly the same hash rate. In other words, miners
in the same pool have a roughly same state, including the cost
and the benefit. A mining pool demands a certain required
hash rate for a miner to join in the mining pool [11].
We consider two reward sharing strategy adopted by a min-
ing pool: PPS mechanism and PPLNS mechanism, of which
the former has a steady income while the latter has a lower
service fee. The mining pool allows the miners’ cooperation
to get rid of the constraints of geographical conditions, and
miners can arbitrarily choose the mining pool according to the
hash rate required and the reward sharing strategy to ultimately
win more rewards. As depicted in Fig. 1, each miner can
observe the reward strategies adopted by all mining pools and
can join freely.

different sharing strategies.
B. Miner’s Reward Model
Miners get the reward which is composed of a fixed coin-
base reward and a transaction verification fee. We consider
each transaction record has the same size and blockchain users
pay a constant fee for each transaction. Considering that the
cost of pool i is comprised of the cost of all miners included,
which is mainly the energy cost. Due to the uncertainty of
the mining system, the rewards will change dynamically and
accordingly miners may choose to switch to a mining pool
using another sharing strategy to pursue higher revenue.
III. PROBLEM FORMULATION
A. Financial Reward in PoW-based Blockchain
For a mining system, we consider that there are N in-
dividual miners, who mine in M mining pools, the set
of which is denoted by M = {1, 2, . . . ,M}. Let x =[
x1, . . . , xM
]�
denote the vector of miners’ population
in pools for which X = x ∈ R
M
+ : {∑i∈M xi = 1}. Different
mining pools have different requirements for hash rate and let
w =
[
ω1, . . . , ωM
]�
denote the requiring hash rate and
for pool i, the probability of wining a mining race is
Pi =
ωixi∑M
j=1 ωjxj
. (1)
Let R denote the coin-base reward, and si denote block size
and ρ denote the transaction fee [10] per unit data size, then
the reward for verifying the transactions in the block is ρsi.
Meanwhile, we denote p as the price for maintaining the unit
hash rate during T . The cost of miners in pool i is denoted
by pωi. Then, we will formulate the payoff for selecting the
two reward sharing strategies, respectively.
1) PPS strategy: The PPS mechanism will give miners
reward immediately according to the effective hash rate
provided by miners. At the cost of higher service fees,
miners can have a steady income and let m1 denote the
service fee when choosing PPS mechanism. Then, the
expected payoff of a miner in pool i which uses PPS
can be obtained by
u1
i = m1
R+ ρsi
Nxi
ωixi∑M
j=1 ωjxj
− pωi. (2)
2) PPLNS strategy: Only after a successful mining round,
miners who have the valid work can share the reward.
If the pool fails to mine a block, then the financial loss
will be borne by miners while service fee is relatively
lower. Assuming that the coincidence of abandoning an
effective block is τ due to the Internet delay [12]. Let
m2 denote the service fee of PPLNS mechanism. Then,
the expected payoff of a miner in a PPLNS-based mining
pool can be expressed as
u2
i = (1− τ)
ωixi∑M
j=1 ωjxj
(m2
R+ ρsi
Nxi
− pωi)
−(1− ωixi∑M
j=1 ωjxj
)pωi.

B. Formulation of the Evolutionary Game
Considering the payoff functions given in (2)-(3), assuming
that each miner is bounded rational, we can model the mining
pool selection game as an evolutionary game [7] with 6-tuple:
G = (N ,M,X ,w,K, uk). The details are shown as follows.
•Players : The players in this game are the miners
included in the mining pool, and N = {1, 2, . . . , N}. Miners
dynamically choose mining pool according to their revenue.
Authorized licensed use limited to: CITY UNIV OF HONG KONG. Downloaded on April 15,2023 at 07:39:42 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. 
•Set of mining pools : Let M = {1, . . . ,M} in the cell
denote the set of mining pools.
•Population : In this game, the population refers to the
population fraction for pool i, i.e., xi = ni/N , which is
denoted by x =
[
x1, . . . , xM
]�
.
•Strategy : The strategies of the mining pool correspond
to the hash rate required and reward sharing mechanism, and
we denote {w,K = {PPS, PPLNS}} as the choices.
•Payoff : The payoff of a miner is affected by the strategy
of the mining pool. As we formulate in (2)-(3), u1
i and u2
i
represent the payoff of using PPS and PPLNS, respectively.
Under the circumstance of aiming to improve their payoff,
miners change mining pool spontaneously. Therefore, the
fraction population of a mining pool keeps varying until each
miner reaches an equilibrium point. This population evolution
can be expressed by replicator dynamics as follows:
ẋi(t) = γxi(t)(u
1,2
i (t)− ū(t)), (4)
where γ is a learning factor controlling the speed of population
evolution, and ū(t) =
∑M
i=1 u
1,2
i xi is the average utility of
the miners. For rational miners, they all choose to join in the
mining pool in which their rewards are higher than average.
Under the principle of chasing above-average payoff, miners
keep switching from one mining pool to another. And when
none of the players can increase the profit by changing the
mining pool separately, then the problem converges to evolu-
tionary equilibrium. The corresponding algorithm is proposed
as shown in Algorithm 1.
When reaching a stable state that the average payoff and
the population share of mining pools become constant, we
consider that the replicator dynamics reaches evolutionary
equilibrium (EE) [13]. While reaching EE, players have no
incentive to change their strategies and their payoff is the same
as average payoff.
C. A Case Study of Two Mining Pools
In this subsection, to simplify the problem we first in-
vestigate a case of two mining pools using different reward
sharing mechanism and analyze the stability conditions for
NE in the game. We view EE as the solution to the pool
selection game where the population fraction of mining pool
do not vary. Under this circumstance, miners has no incentive
to change their mining pool to pursue more payoff. The
EE can be obtained by solving the fixed points equation
ẋi(t) = 0, i ∈ [1, 2] and let the population share of each pool
be x1 = x, x2 = 1 − x. The results of equation given by (4)
are as follows:
x∗ ∈
{
0, 1,
a− b+ (1− τ)Npw2
2 −Npw1w2
Np(w1 − w2)2 −Npτw2
2
}
, (5)
where a = (R+ρs1)m1w1 and b = (1−τ)(R+ρs2)m2w2. As
we can see, (x∗, 1− x∗) is the rest point of above-mentioned
equation, then we will study the evolutionary stability strategy
(ESS) of these three points.

After some mathematical calculations based on (10) − (13),
we have

(16)
Accordingly, Theorem 1 has been proved.
In reality, all miners mine in the same blockchain net-
work, so we can consider that the quantity of miners is
sufficiently large. Based on Theorem 1, we denote that N
tends to infinity, so we can have a further discussion on the
rest points. After some mathematical simplifications, we find
lim
N→+∞
det(J11) < 0 is valid when ω1 > (1 − τ)ω2 while
lim
N→+∞
det(J) > 0 is valid when ω1 < (1 − τ)ω2, which
is mutually contradictory, so x∗ = 0 is not an ESS. At
x∗ = 1, lim
N→+∞
det(J11) < 0 is established only when pω1 < 0
while both p and ω1 are positive, so x∗ = 1 is not an
stable strategy. As for x∗ =
a−b+(1−τ)Npw2
2−Npw1w2
Np(w1−w2)2−Npτw2

, the
simplification process is as follows:
lim

.
(17)

. (18)
x∗ is an ESS if the conditions given by (17)-(18) are
satisfied. Namely, it means that both lim
N→+∞
det(J11) < 0 and
lim
N→+∞
det(J) > 0 are satisfied and then the Jacobian matrix is
negative definite. When N becomes infinite, either x = (0, 1)
or x = (1, 0) is surely not an ESS in this mining system. And
obviously, the requiring hash rate of mining pool plays a vital
role in a game and determines the existence of Evolutionary
Stable Strategy.
IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS
For the numerical results, as mentioned before, we first
analyze the case of two mining pools using different reward
sharing mechanism. We consider a mining system with N =
10000 miners, who select a mining pool from M = {1, 2}
with pool 1 using PPS mechanism and pool 2 using PPLNS
mechanism. We set the service fee m1 = 0.93,m2 = 0.98,
respectively. We assume the token reward is R = 10000,
s1 = s2 = 200, ρ = 0.1 and the electricity fee is p = 0.05. We
set ω1 = 20, ω2 = 5 which denote the requiring hash rate of
the mining pool. Due to the network delay, the valid block will
be abandoned and we denote the influence factor τ = 0.01. We
first investigate the evolution dynamics from the initial state
x(0) = (0.4, 0.6). Fig. 2 shows that the population fraction of
mining pools using different sharing mechanism converges to
a stable state x∗ = (0.89, 0.11), which is the solution to the
game. As shown in Fig. 3, the payoff of miners in different
mining pool eventually converges from the different initial
state to the same equilibrium and the average payoff gradually
becomes stable. For the pool using PPS sharing mechanism,
the population fraction increases while the average payoff

of miners decreases and eventually reaches a evolutionary
equilibrium state.
Then we analyze effects of reward sharing strategy on the
mining system. With the same system settings, we consider
a game with more players, in which the initial population
fraction of four mining pools is x = 0.25. In Fig. 4, when
the average payoff is positive definite, miners have a tendency
to join in a mining pool which requires a higher hash rate. A
strategy with a higher hash rate equals to a higher probability
of winning the mining race. As shown in Fig. 5, each pool
converges to a evolution equilibrium when they have the same
settings except hash rate. A mining pool requiring a lower
hash rate attracts more miners due to the lower electricity
fee. From Fig. 6, we observe that if the average payoff is
negative definite, only the mining pool with the highest or
lowest requiring hash rate can survive. The highest hash rate
indicates that it has the highest opportunity to generate a valid
block while the lowest hash rate indicates the lowest electricity
fee, both of which aim to minimize the expense.
For comparison, we also consider a case to analyze the
effects of internet delay on the mining system. The four mining
pools’ sharing strategies are set to be {PPS, PPLNS, PPS,
PPLNS}, respectively. We try to find the relationship between
the network delay and the miners selection choice. From Fig.
7, we can observe that if the initial state is equivalent, the
mining pool with higher requiring hash rate is attractive both
in PPS and PPLNS mechanism. When the τ becomes large
and the coincidence of abandoning a valid block is 10% in
Fig. 8, average payoff becomes negative definite and miners
tend to join in the mining pool with lower hash rate. Further,
the τ is 0.3 in Fig. 9, miners will give up PPLNS mechanism
and prefer to choose a stable payoff.
V. CONCLUSION
We have considered the issue of selecting mining pools
with different reward sharing strategies. The pool selection
of miners is modeled as an evolutionary game and replicator
dynamics is used to model the strategy adaptation process. We
have assumed that miners are always bounded rational and all
of them will switch mining pools for a higher rewards. A
low complexity algorithm has been proposed to achieve the
equilibrium. We have considered that reward sharing strategy
adopted by mining pool, the required hash rate and the network
delay are the main factors which affect the determination
of miners. We have performed theoretical analysis on the
equilibrium stability for a special case of two mining pools.

Moreover, an experiment has been performed to analyze the
difference between three mining systems (mixed strategy,
PPS, PPLNS). At last, we have considered the effects of
internet delay in a mining system. Numerical analysis has
been performed and the results have validated the theoretical
discoveries of our study.
