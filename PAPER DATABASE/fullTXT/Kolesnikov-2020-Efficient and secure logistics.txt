Abstract. The presented comparative characteristic of the values of the indicators of the 
Logistics Efficiency Index illustrates the problems of the transport and logistics complex of 
Russia. Consideration of the effectiveness of the transport and logistics complex from various 
perspectives (financial, production) made it possible to justify the need to formalize the 
relations (coordination of conflicting interests) of the participants in the logistics process, to 
ensure the internal integrity and security of the functioning of the transport and logistics 
complex. The solution to these issues was proposed by creating a special cyberphysical system 
using multi-agent systems, Internet of things, blockchain, and Big Data, Data Mining 
intelligent technologies. The presentation of the transport and logistics complex as a cyber-
physical system made it possible to consider it in the following aspects: - as an interaction of 
agents based on multi-agent systems (information interaction is organized on the principles of 
blockchain and the Internet of things); - as a continuous process of transport services, the 
improvement of the technology of which is proposed to be carried out using the process and 
design approaches, a mathematical description - through models based on the theory of mass 
service and coordination of economic interests of economic entities; - as an artificial 
intelligence system based on Big Data, Data Mining technologies, including the theory of 
pattern recognition, game theory, methods of self-organization of models (for example, the 
method of group accounting of arguments), cognitive analysis and others.  
1. Introduction 
The role and place of transport and logistics complexes (TLC) in the national economy is difficult to 
overestimate. They connect the economies of spatially dispersed regions of Russia, provide the work 
of international transport corridors. TLCs containing ports are especially important. They concentrate 
operation of almost all types of transport: sea, rail, pipeline, automobile, river. 
Cargo turnover of Russian ports in recent years is constantly growing. So, in 2017, the largest ports 
of Russia handled 787 million tons of cargo. The largest share of transshipment is occupied by the 
Azov-Black Sea basin (ABSb) - 34.2%. The cargo turnover of the ports of ABSb in 2017 amounted to 
269.5 million tons, which doubles the figure for 2010 [1]. 
In TLC, the following interacts: the owner of the cargo, the sender of the cargo, various subsystems 
of its processing (stations, storage systems, road sections, ports, etc.), the receiver of the cargo, higher-
order management systems (ministries, various departments, analytical centers). So, TLC is: 
1. A lot of participants and, as a result, a lot of interests of economic structures (the task of 
coordinating these interests arises). 
2. The complexity of the technological processes of cargo handling (it is necessary to assess the 
effectiveness and safety, both at the local levels of individual participants, and at the level of the entire 
TLC).

3. The complexity of the information interaction of the TLC participants. Two issues should be 
highlighted here: 
 
 the need to process large amounts of information; 
 to ensure regulated openness / closeness of information. On the one hand, the quality of TLC 
work depends on the availability of this information (it should be complete, objective and 
accessible to all participants in the transportation process). On the other hand, this availability 
reduces its security. 
 
Every two years, the World Bank carries out a study of the logistics capabilities of 167 countries, 
which also includes the section “Logistics Performance Index” (LPI) [2]. LPI analyzes countries 
according to six indicators and reflects its convenience and safety. These indicators are: the 
effectiveness and accessibility of customs and border controls, the quality of transport and trade 
infrastructure, the quality and competence of logistics services, the ability to track goods, the 
frequency with which the goods are delivered to the recipient on the planned delivery dates, the 
possibility of organizing competitively priced supplies. 
These indicators are selected on the basis of theoretical and empirical studies, practical experience 
of logistics operators associated with international freight forwarding. Figure 1 gives a comparative 
description of these indicators for Russia and Germany, which reflects the problems of the Russian 
TLC. 
 
Figure 1. The values of LPI indicators of Germany and Russia. Built on data [2]. 
The effectiveness of TLCs should be considered in various aspects: financial (this is a requirement 
of a market economy), production (loading / unloading volumes, cargo traffic volumes should 
correspond to the interests of all economic entities - EE). At the same time, private indicators (of 
individual EE) and general indicators (of the whole TLC, regional and national economy as a whole) 
are distinguished. 
All these problems and tasks are related to the regulation of human interaction (H) and decision 
support systems (DSS), which in turn are divided into two types: internal (the decision maker (DM) 
interacts and his DSS) and external (interact person and DSS of a competing company and / or co-
executor of the transportation process). 
For internal communications, it is necessary to reduce the role of the decision-maker's subjectivity 
and the level of errors due to his emotionality, fatigue, low qualification, but the person is an expert, 
and therefore it is necessary to include the mechanism of teaching the machine how to make a decision

and derive an agreed decision from the decision-maker and the machine. It is also necessary to protect 
their communication from external disturbances (cyberattacks, in particular). 
For external communication and chatting procedures, efficiency, completeness, and again, 
protection are important (it is more difficult, since communication goes beyond the scope of a closed 
system, uses weakly protected channels). 
The solution to the problems formulated is seen in the creation of a specialized cyber-physical 
system (CPS) based on technologies: multi-agent systems (MAS) [3], the Internet of things (IW), and 
blockchain [4]. The coordination and regulation of the relations of the TLC participants is supposed to 
be carried out using approaches and methods of the theory of active systems [5], intelligent 
technologies (Data Mining, Big Data) [6]. 
1.1. TLK is a cyberphysical system 
The analysis allows us to present TLC in several aspects: 
1. As the interaction of agents (which are various EE of transport process). In this setting, the 
basis for interaction should be the MAS. In this case, it is necessary to distinguish the MAS of two 
types: 
 
 market type MAS. Each agent is looking for the most profitable partner, based on their own 
interests. For example, the owner of the wagons does not supply them for the transportation of 
disadvantageous goods. Relevant digital platforms ignore common interests. The transport 
process slows down and crumbles.  
 MAS, providing the work of various transport and economic associations. For example: 
Unified network technological process, transportation ground, regional economy, transport 
corridor, etc. 
 
Information interaction in these MASs is implemented on the principles of the Internet of things 
and blockchain. The “things” in the MAS of the TLC are individuals and the general population, as 
well as individual actuators and systems included in the TLC (sorting and cargo stations, sections of 
the track, repair and storage points, ports, etc.). 
Blockchain is a software scheme for information re-recording that provides: user-friendly access to 
it, secure storage, efficient (in speed and minimizing data errors) information transfer and use.  
1.2. As a continuous transport service process 
The implementation of this property of TLC is achieved by a number of technological procedures and 
mathematical models. 
It is proposed to improve the transport process of the TLC through the implementation of the 
process and design approaches [7]. In the first case, the traditional functional (structural) organization 
of production (relations hierarchy) is subject to the requirements of the process organization 
(principles of “one window”, “delivery of goods to doors”). The project approach distinguishes 
individual projects from the whole process, on which the attention of consumers and performers is 
concentrated. 
In this case, there is a double subordination of performers (to the head of the functional unit and the 
project manager). This managerial shortcoming is compensated by increased reliability of work 
(double control) and focus on the final result. The situation, when everyone has fulfilled their 
functions, and the transport problem is not solved, is excluded. 
For the mathematical description of the transport and logistics process, it is proposed to use two 
formalized models based on the queueing theory (QT) [8] and the use of the procedure for reconciling 
the economic interests of EE [9]. 
QT represents the entire transport and logistics process in the form of series and parallel 
connections of individual links. An example of a serial connection: receiving trains at a station, 
sorting, moving along a section, accumulation, transshipment at a port. Parallel connection can be

realized by simultaneous servicing at the station by different teams, parallel dissolution, movement 
along different routes with matching starting and ending points, etc. 
QT is well developed for the simplest (Poisson) cargo flows with stationary properties (flow 
characteristics: average value, dispersion, and other process indicators are independent of time), lack 
of aftereffect (system performance at time t does not depend on its performance up to this point ), 
ordinary (two service requests cannot enter the system at the same time). 
These properties are difficult to put into practice. Indeed, the traffic flows are affected by the time 
of year, days of the week, weather conditions, that is, they cannot be stationary. The same can be said 
for the lack of aftereffect (the harder the system works, the less resource it has in the future), and for 
ordinary (several ships come to the port for loading and unloading). 
In this regard, to evaluate the performance of the TLC, it is recommended to use the QT: 
 
 in limited areas of time (the flow properties do not have time to significantly change and the 
adequacy of the model is not lost); 
 as a model of the first (linear) approximation. 
 
The procedure for reconciling the economic interests of individuals due to their particular 
importance is discussed in detail below in the clause “Refinement and development of mathematical 
models to ensure the “economic interest” of CPS participants.” 
2. As a system of artificial intelligence 
Consideration of TLC as MAS, the use of IoT technology is already creating the so-called “ant” 
intelligence in the system. This is the intelligence of a community of interacting agents. It manifests 
itself as a result of synergy: each agent does not possess this intellect, but the system functions 
reasonably. 
In addition, it is appropriate to introduce special intelligent technologies into the work of the TLC. 
These, for example, include the so-called Big Data, technologies for extracting knowledge from data 
(Data Mining). 
Currently, all TLC subsystems operate quite independently of each other. For example, when 
releasing on a hump yard, the cut of cars did not show the running properties expected from it, but this 
information is not available for other TLC subsystems. Technical means that make it possible to 
identify any carriage, generally any vehicle (car, sea or river vessel), wherever it is, are already exist. 
We need a digital platform that combines this information, sorts and gives out to an interested person. 
These platforms are developed within Big Data technologies. 
Classical statistics (for example, regression analysis) allows you to find unknown relationships 
between the studied variables. But this process is completely dependent on the person (it indicates the 
task, assigns the structure of the model, and the machine calculates its parameters only).  
Data mining technologies automate this process. The basic technologies of Data Mining are the 
theory of pattern recognition, game theory, methods of self-organization of models (for example, the 
method of group accounting of arguments), cognitive analysis, etc. 
3. Results of the research 
3.1. Refinement and development of mathematical models to ensure the "economic interest" of CPS 
participants 
We consider the solution of the problem by the example of reconciling the conflicting interests of the 
EE of different levels of management. In the theory of active systems [5], a priori given models of 
their behavior are used for this purpose:

           (1) 
As a rule, it is not possible to satisfy the requirements of this formalization in practice, therefore, in 
[9], an improved model for reconciling the interests of EE is proposed. 
We identify the dependence of the company's revenue (EE interest) in the vicinity of the extremum 
point using a quadratic dependence of the general form: 
у = а0 + а1х + а2х
2           (2) 
We transform (2), to complete the square, we get: 
у = - m(х – а)2 + b                                                             (3) 
If the EE fulfills the plan established by the upper level of management, then the reward is carried 
out according to the identified dependence (3), curve 1 in Figure 2 (without penalties). 
 
Figure 2. A geometric 
illustration of the imposition of 
sanctions on the company for 
not fulfilling the plan. Borrowed 
from [9].  
For the area [0; х0] it is profitable for the company to fulfill the plan, and for the loading area from 
а and further, the company tends to underestimate the volume of work performed. If the EE does not 
fulfill the plan, sanctions are imposed on it by proportionally reducing the value b with coefficient 0 < 
k < 1. That is, if the plan is not fulfilled, the enterprise works according to the model (4) curve 2 in 
figure 2: 
у = - m(х – а)2 + kb                                                           (4) 
Obviously, the curvature of curve 1 should also be preserved for curve 2, for reasons that the 
production process in both cases develops similarly, that is, either without sanctions (formula 3) or 
with sanctions (formula 4). 
Obviously, while the value of the plan is between [x0; xAN], the company is also profitable to 
implement the plan. If the upper level of management assigns a plan that exceeds the value xAN, then it 
will be more profitable for the company to sell products (transport services) in the amount of x0 and 
get revenue for this in the amount of kb (when overfulfilling the plan, it is less). That is, the segment 
[x0;xAN] – area of coordinated decisions of the considered EE. We find this area in terms of the known 
parameters а, k, b, m. To do this, we solve the equation (we find the abscissa of the intersection of 
curve 1 with a horizontal line у = kb): 
kb = - m(х – а)2 + b                                                           (5) 
From (5) it follows easily that:  
XAN = а + (b(1 – k)/m)0.5                                                      (6) 
Example. The interest of the transport company is described by the ratio: 
у = -1055.51(х – 120.44)2 + 753946                                          (7) 
Suppose that, in accordance with plans agreed upon with the highest level of TLC management, a 
load on a transport company of 130 million tons is expected. Obviously, this value exceeds the desired

6
(optimal) value equal to 120.44 million tons. The penalty parameter that ensures the fulfillment of the 
task is to be determined. 
We use the formula (6). From where it easily follows: 
k = 1 – m(xAN – а)2/b                                                      (8) 
By the terms of our task с = 130, parameters m, а and b are known from (3), respectively m = 
1055.51, а = 120.44 million tons and b = 753946 ths. dollars. USA. And xAN we take equal to 130. 
From (8) we have: k =0.88. 
That is, when the plan is fulfilled, the enterprise receives revenue in accordance with model (7), 
and if it is not fulfilled according to the model: 
у =-1055.51(х –120.44)2+753946 · 0.88 = -1055.51(х –120.44)2 + 663472.5          (9)
