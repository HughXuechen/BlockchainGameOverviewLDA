Abstract
By fully utilizing the capability of the spreading intelligent terminals, crowd spectrum sensing is an efficient and cost-effective 
framework to realize large-scale and broadband spectrum sensing. However, traditional crowd sensing system relies on a 
centralized architecture, which not only face severe security and privacy issues, but also may not be able to attract enough 
users to participate in the sensing tasks due to the lack of effective incentive mechanisms and guaranteed rewards. In this 
paper, we propose a blockchain-based crowd spectrum sensing framework to achieve secure and privacy-preserving spectrum 
sensing with guaranteed rewards for participating users. Considering the constraint of the sensing task and the workload of 
users, the optimal pricing and sensing task allocation scheme under the minimum sensing task constraint is investigated by 
leveraging Stackelberg game model. We analyze the Nash equilibrium of the sub-games and derive the optimal pricing and 
sensing task allocation strategy, for both uniform pricing and non-uniform pricing schemes. Simulation results demonstrate 
the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and it is shown that the scheme can maximize the utility while ensuring the com-
pletion of the sensing tasks.

1 Introduction
With the commercialization of 5G and the rapid develop-
ment of emerging wireless applications, the wireless com-
munication traffic and demands for spectrum resources are 
growing explosively [1, 2]. In order to meet the spectrum 
resources demand of future mobile communication sys-
tem, it is urgent to adopt dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) 
[3]. While DSS facilitates efficient utilization of current 
spectrum resources, spectrum sensing is required to make 
optimal spectrum allocation strategy with active users’ fre-
quency and location information. Considering the large-
scale and dynamic characteristics of the spectrum sharing 
system, it is costly to deploy wide area spectrum sensing 
networks.
Different from traditional sensing methods, by using 
existing mobile intelligent devices to collect large-scale 
sensing data, crowd sensing is a new data aggregation par-
adigm with good mobility and scalability [4, 5], and can 
greatly reduce the construction and maintenance costs of the 
sensing network [6, 7]. Applying crowd sensing to spectrum 
sensing can achieve efficient large-scale and dynamic spec-
trum data collection.
However, the traditional crowd sensing system mostly 
adopts a centralized architecture, which makes the sys-
tem vulnerable to single point of failure, and also faces 
the risks of malicious attacks such as man in the middle 
attack, and distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, 
etc., which affects the reliability and security of the system 
[8, 9]. On the other hand, data collection in crowd sensing 
will consume power, computing, and storage resources of

mobile devices, which must be compensated with reason-
able rewards. Otherwise, rational users may not participate 
in crowd sensing [10, 11]. More importantly, the spectrum 
sensing results contain time and location information of 
the users, through which the behaviors of participating 
users may be infered and thus the privacy information is 
disclosed. Therefore, it is necessary to design a secure and 
reasonable crowd sensing system.
Blockchain provides a solution to the issues existed in 
the conventional crowd sensing system. Based on a dis-
tributed ledger, blockchain has the advantages of tamper-
proof, and improved integrity, traceability, and security 
[12–14]. With the blockchain technology, a distributed 
spectrum sensing system can be established without a 
trusted central server or a third-party organization.
In this paper, we propose a blockchain based crowd 
spectrum sensing (BCSS) system, where the server pub-
lishes sensing tasks in the blockchain network. Users 
can obtain the tasks and corresponding rewards from the 
blockchain, and thus determine whether to participate 
the task. The interactions and spectrum sensing results 
are recorded in the blockchain after being verified by the 
verification nodes, which effectively prevents the collusion 
attack initiated by the sensing platform and overcomes 
the security risks faced by the trusted third party. In this 
way, the reliability and security of the system can be effec-
tively improved. Besides, considering the constraint of 
sensing task, a pricing method of sensing task is designed 
to encourage users to participate in the sensing task and 
maximize the utility of both parties. The main contribu-
tions are summarized as follows.
– We propose a blockchain-based crowd spectrum sens-
ing mechanism and describe the flow of blockchain 
based crowd spectrum sensing, where the transactions 
and spectrum sensing results are recorded in the block-
chain, such that the security and privacy issues in con-
ventional sensing systems can be avoided.
– We formulate the interaction between the server and 
users into a Stackelberg game under the constraints 
of task requirement, and proposed a pricing method, 
which encourages users to participate in the sensing 
task, and maximize the utility of all parties to guarantee 
the completion of the sensing task.
– We consider both uniform pricing scheme and non-
uniform pricing scheme, and derive the optimal pricing 
and task allocation under two schemes. When the task 
requirement is small, the performance of two schemes 
is the same. But the utility of the server under the non-
uniform pricing scheme is higher than that under the 
uniform pricing scheme when the task requirement 
increases gradually.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion 2 reviews related work, Sect. 3 introduces the model 
of the blockchain-based crowd spectrum sensing system. 
Pricing and sensing task allocation method based on the 
game model is presented in Sect. 4. Simulation results and 
discussions are given in Sect. 5. Section 6 concludes this 
paper. Future work is introduced in Section 7.

2.1  Crowdsensing and spectrum sensing
There has been a lot of research works on the combination 
of crowd sensing and spectrum sensing. Most of them aim 
to integrate the incentive mechanism in crowd sensing with 
spectrum sensing [15–18]. Lv and Zhu considered detection 
probability and sensing time, and proposed a cooperative 
spectrum sensing algorithm based on multi-task crowd sens-
ing by combining crowd sensing incentive mechanism and 
cooperative spectrum sensing, so as to improve secondary 
user participation and cooperative spectrum detection prob-
ability [15]. Li et al. proposed an incentive mechanism based 
on social selfishness, which solves the problem that self-
ish secondary users only interest in their personal interests, 
and encourages them to participate in cooperative spectrum 
sensing [17]. Meanwhile, game theory is often used to solve 
problems in this respect [19–22]. In [19], Nie et al. used 
a two-stage Stackelberg game to analyze the participation 
level of the mobile users and the optimal incentive mecha-
nism of the crowdsensing service provider. They investi-
gated two types of incentive mechanism respectively for the 
crowdsensing platform with complete and incomplete infor-
mation on social network effects, then proposed the optimal 
incentive mechanism in terms of discriminatory reward and 
uniform reward. Yang et al. designed an incentive mecha-
nism using a Stackelberg game for the crowdsourcer-centric 
model. In the model, the crowd-sourcer announces a total 
reward and each user is rewarded according to the propor-
tion of their sensing time. The authors analyzed the Stackel-
berg game between crowd-sourcer and users, then presented 
an efficient algorithm to compute the unique Stackelberg 
equilibrium [21]. Besides, in [23], the authors described the 
crowd-sensing based spectrum monitoring architecture, and 
proposed a privacy-preserving protocol with a secure trust 
mechanism.
2.2  Blockchain‑based crowd sensing
The emergence of blockchain provides an opportunity to 
solve the issues of the conventional crowd sensing sys-
tem. Recently, blockchain based crowd sensing system 
784 Peer-to-Peer Networking and Applications (2022) 15:783–792

has attracted more research attentions [24–28]. Li et al. 
proposed a decentralized crowdsourcing framework based 
on blockchain, named CrowdBC, and presented a concrete 
framework, in which smart contract is used to perform 
crowdsourcing task, and the feasibility of the proposed 
scheme was verified through a software prototype and 
real data set on Ethereum [24]. Wei et al. constructed a 
standard blockchain-based mobile crowd sensing model, 
designed a smart contract suitable for its operation, and 
formulated the incentive problem as an optimization prob-
lem [25]. The privacy of crowd sensing has also been con-
sidered [29–32]. In [29], Wang et al. proposed a secure 
crowd sensing incentive mechanism based on blockchain, 
and designed a node cooperative verification method, 
which uses intragroup negotiation and group transaction 
verification to realize k-anonymity privacy protection. In 
[32], Zou et al. proposed an effective blockchain-based 
location-privacy-preserving crowdsensing model, to 
improve the data sensing quality and protect worker’s pri-
vacy through a two-stage approach.
It is worth noting that existing works consider crowd 
sensing and spectrum sensing jointly, which focus the 
incentive mechanism and crowd spectrum sensing algo-
rithm. Considering the challenges in existing crowd 
sensing schemes, in this paper, we propose a blockchain 
based crowd spectrum sensing (BCSS) system, which 
can effectively improve the reliability and security of 
the system.
3  System model and problem formulation
As shown in Fig. 1, we consider a BCSS system where 
a server and N users participate in the spectrum sens-
ing based on the blockchain system. The server collects 
sensing tasks which can be completed by users, and then 
publishes tasks and corresponding rewards on the block-
chain network. Users on the blockchain receive the task 
and decide whether to perform the sensing task, given the 
reward and their own cost. To ensure that the sensing tasks 
are completed and users are encouraged to contribute to the 
sensing tasks, the server needs to set a reasonable reward 
for the task.
For the server, we assume that the required minimum 
workload is D, otherwise, the sensing task cannot be com-
pleted. Define the task price, i.e., the reward per unit work-
load given by the server to uesr wi is pi , and let vi represent 
the workload completed by user wi . When the task is com-
pleted, the server’s revenue is GD, where G is the revenue 
coefficient of the server. Therefore, the utility function of the 
server is expressed as
where v =
[
v1, v2,⋯ , vN
]
 is the vector of the workload com-
pleted by the users and p =
[
p1, p2,⋯ , pN
]
 is the vector of 
reward per unit workload given by the server to uesrs.

Each user gets rewards by performing sensing tasks, at the 
same time, also incurs a certain cost. Since users are lim-
ited by resources, time and other aspects such as energy, the 
maximum workload that each user can contribute is limited. 
Therefore, the utility function of user wi is given by
Note that ci is the user’s cost coefficient, di is the maxi-
mum workload that user wi can complete, and vi is user wi ’s 
workload.
Obviously, users can get more rewards from the server 
by performing more tasks, which, on the other hand, will 
also incur a higher cost. Therefore, rational users need 
to generate an optimal strategy to balance the cost and 
reward to maximize their utility. Since both the server 
and users are selfish and rational, game theory is suitable 
to describe the problem mathematically. In this paper, 
we adopt the Stackelberg game model, where the server 
acts as the leader to set the optimal reward and users as 
followers to determine the workload. The leader needs 
to find the optimal pricing to achieve the maximum util-
ity under the workload demand constraint. Each follower 
will contribute optimal workload according to the pricing 
given by the leader to maximize its utility. The optimiza-
tion problems of the server and users can be formulated 
as follows [33].

For the proposed Stackelberg game, based on the definition 
of Nash equilibrium in [34], the SE is defined in the follow-
ing definition.

tion for the sensing task pricing problem and v∗

for the workload choice problem of the user. Then the point

In the following, we use the backward induction method 
to analyze the Stackelberg game. We first consider a uniform 
pricing scheme, where the reward per unit workload set by 
the server is the same for all users, i.e., pi = p,∀i.
4.1  Uniform pricing scheme
According to Eq. (4), the user’s optimization problem can 
be written as:
Then we have the following proposition.
Proposition 1 For a given unit workload price p, the optimal 
solution for Problem 1 is given by:
Where �i =

Proof According to Eq. (2), the first-order and second-order 
partial derivatives of Ui with respect to vi are
According to Eqs. (9) and (10), the second derivative is less 
than zero when vi ≤ di and is larger than zero otherwise. So 
the first derivative achieves the minimum value when vi = di . 
If p >
ci
di ln 2
 , Ui increases monotonically with vi . If p ≤
ci
di ln 2
 , 
the first derivative decreases monotonically with vi , and Eq. 
(9) is larger than zero when vi = 0 , so there exists a positive 
value makes �Ui
�vi
= 0 hold. Hence, Ui achieves the maximum 
value when �Ui
�vi
= 0 . Since vi ≤ di , we can obtain Eq. (8). 
Thus, Proposition 1 is proved.   ◻

 increases monotonically 
with p. In addition, under the same unit workload price,

proved.   ◻
From proposition 2, can conclude that Problem 2a has 
an optimal solution p∗ satisfiy Eq. (14) when Eq. (13) 
holds. It means that when D is small, the server can maxi-
mize the utility with a small reward p. However, when

Now, Problem 2 can be converted to a minimization problem 
as:
It is observed that Problem 2b has similar formation as Prob-
lem2a, according to the previous analysis, it is easy to know 
that when D satisfies the following conditions, Problem 2b 
has an optimal solution:
Proposition 3 If D satisfies Eq. (17), the optimal solution of 
Problem 2b satisfies the following equation:
Proof The proof is similar to that of Proposition 2, and is 
omitted here.
Then we conclude that When D satisfies Eq. (17), Prob-
lem 2 has an optimal solution p∗ which satisfies Eq. (18)

 , the unit reward p∗ given by 
the server should also be increased.
Based on Proposition 2 and Proposition 3, we further 
consider the case of D in other intervals, it is easy to obtain 
the optimal solution of problem 2 with the form of Eq. (19), 
shown at the top of the this page, with
According to Eq. (19), we can find that the server should 
set the price according to the workload demand D. For a 
given D, the optimal unit reward p is unique. In Eq. (19), 
the proofs of D in other different intervals are similar to that 
of Proposition 2 and Proposition 3, which are omitted here.
Now, the Stackelberg game for the optimal sensing task 
pricing scheme is completely solved. With the optimal solu-
tions of Problem 1 and Problem 2 we can obtain the SE for 
the proposed Stackelberg game: (p∗, v∗) , where p∗ is given 
by Eq. (19), v∗ is given by Eq. (8).
Notice that it is difficult to obtain the analytical solutions 
of the related equations in Eq. (19), so we consider calcu-
lating the numerical solutions. Based on Proposition 2 and 
Proposition 3, we know that when D is in a certain interval, 
we can not only obtain the equation that the optimal solution 
p∗ satisfies, but also obtain its interval, which is convenient 
for us to find the numerical solution of p∗ . Besides, accord-
ing to Eqs. (12) and (16), given an interval of D, both the 
objective function and the left-hand side of the constraint 
condition are monotonically increasing functions of p, when 
equality holds in constrained condition, the objective func-
tion is maximized. Based on this, we can use the bisection 
method to obtain the numerical solution of p∗.
4.2  Non‑uniform pricing scheme
We have analyzed the uniform sensing task pricing scheme, 
where the reward per unit workload is the same for all users. 
In this subsection, we further investigate the non-uniform 
pricing scheme, where the unit reward for different users 
varies.

According to Eq. (8), for user wi , it will choose to com-
plete the maximum workload di when p ≥
ci
di ln 2
 . Even if p is 
increased, wi has reached the upper limit of its capability and 
cannot contribute more workload. In other words, if 
p ≥
ci
di ln 2
 , i.e., when the reward per unit workload p given by 
the server to user wi exceeds 
ci
di ln 2
 , the server cannot get more 
benefits from wi.
It is easy to know that for those users who have contrib-
uted the maximum workload, the unit reward given by the 
server should just encourage them to complete the maximum 
workload. In this way, users will not reduce their workload 
and the server can avoid paying too much. We propose a 
non-uniform pricing scheme. Specifically, for user wi , if the 
unit reward p of uniform pricing scheme exceeds ci
di ln 2
 , then 
the unit reward given by the server to wi is set as ci
di ln 2
.
Here p∗ is given by Eq. (19).
5  Simulation results and discussions
In this section, simulation results are presented to demon-
strate the performance of the proposed scheme. We assume 
that the workload demand D of sensing task will not exceed 
the sum of the maximum workload of all users, that is, the 
sensing task can always be completed. Without loss of gen-
erality, the maximum workload di of users are assumed to 
obey a uniform distribution on interval [5, 10], and the cost 
coefficients ci of users are assumed to obey a uniform distri-
bution on interval [15, 20].
First of all, the relationship between the task price p and 
workload demand D under the proposed optimal pricing 
method is examined. As shown in Fig. 2, given the num-
ber of users, the unit price p of the task increases with the 
workload demand D. This is because when D increases, each 
user needs to complete more workload, so the server needs 
to give a higher price to motivate users. In addition, the 
relationship between the task price p and number of users is 
shown in Fig. 3. We can see that the task price decreases as 
the number of users under the same workload demand. This

is because as the number of users increases, the workload 
that each user needs to complete decreases, so the task price 
also decreases.
The total utility of all users and the utility of the server 
under the proposed optimal pricing method are evaluated in 
Figs. 4 and 5. Given the workload demand, with the increase 
of the number of users, the total utility of users decrease, 
while the utility of server increases. This is because as the 
number of users increases, the price of tasks will decrease, 
while the total workload completed by users remains 
unchanged. For the server, the total payment to the users 
decreases, resulting in an increase in its utility. Besides, the 
utility of both users and the server increase with the work-
load demand under the same number of users. It can be seen 
that the total utility of users and the utility of the server 
tend to be flat gradually, when the number of users is large 
enough.
The workload completed by users and the workload 
demand is examined in Fig. 6. We assume three users par-
ticipate in sensing task and the maximum workload of all 
users are assumed to be identical with d1 = d2 = d3 = 10 , 
and the cost coefficients of these users are different with 
[c1, c2, c3] = [20, 15, 10] . As shown in Fig. 6, instead of one 
user completing the task alone, three users contribute the 
required workload of sensing task together. On one hand, the 
capability of a single user may not be enough to complete 
the whole task when the workload demand is large. On the 
other hand, the server can get larger utility with more users 
competition. Meanwhile, we can find that users with lower 
cost coefficients tend to contribute more workload under the

same maximum workload. For the server, stimulating these 
cheaper users to make more contribution for the sensing task 
can reduce the total reward paid to users and increase its 
utility.
The performance between the uniform pricing and non-
uniform pricing is compared in Fig. 7. We introduce another 
pricing method for comparison, i.e., average pricing method. 
We assume there are five users participate in sensing task. 
As shown in Fig. 7, under the uniform pricing scheme and 
non-uniform pricing scheme, the utility of the server are 
higher than that of the average pricing method. As men-
tioned above, the uniform pricing and non-uniform pricing 
schemes both can encourage cheaper users to contribute 
more workload to reduce the server’s payment. However, 
the average pricing method makes different users complete 
the same workload, result in lower utility. Besides, compare 
uniform pricing and non-uniform pricing schemes, we can 
find that when D is small, the utility of server is the same 
under the two schemes. When D gets larger and larger, the 
utility of the server under non-uniform pricing scheme is 
higher than that under the uniform pricing scheme.
6  Conclusion
In this paper, we have proposed a blockchain-based crowd 
spectrum sensing framework, which takes advantage of 
blockchain to solve the issues of reliability and stability in 
the conventional crowd sensing system. To encourages users 
to participate in the sensing task, we consider the constraint 
of the sensing task and the workload that users contribute to 
sensing task, a Stackelberg game based formulation is estab-
lished to study the utility maximization for the server and 
users. The server’s optimal pricing method under both uni-
form and non-uniform pricing schemes are developed, the 
performance of the proposed sensing task pricing method is 
examined through simulation. The simulation results showed 
that the proposed sensing task pricing method can ensure the 
completion of sensing task, while maximizing the utilities 
of the server and users.
7  Future work
In this work, some of the details in the BCSS system are 
not fully considered, and we only consider the task alloca-
tion and pricing method for a single task. In future work, 
on the one hand, we will further refine the model and pro-
cess of blockchain-based crowd spectrum sensing system, 
by incorporating more details such as smart contract based 
task auction with reputation. On the other hand, we will 
consider more complex situations and study the task allo-
cation and pricing method for multiple sensing tasks.
