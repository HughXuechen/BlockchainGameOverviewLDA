Abstract
Neuregulin-1β (NRG-1β) is critical for cardiac development and repair, and recombinant forms 
are currently being assessed as possible therapeutics for systolic heart failure. We previously 
demonstrated that recombinant NRG-1β reduces cardiac fibrosis in an animal model of cardiac 
remodeling and heart failure, suggesting that there may be direct effects on cardiac fibroblasts. 
Here we show that NRG-1β receptors (ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4) are expressed in normal human 
cardiac ventricular (NHCV) fibroblast cell lines. Treatment of NHCV fibroblasts with recombinant 
NRG-1β induced activation of the AKT pathway, which was phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-
dependent. Moreover, the NRG-1β-induced PI3K/AKT signaling in these cells required 
phosphorylation of both ErbB2 and ErbB3 receptors at tyrosine (Tyr)1248 and Tyr1289 
respectively. RNASeq analysis of NRG-1β-treated cardiac fibroblasts obtained from three different 
individuals revealed a global gene expression signature consistent with cell growth and survival. 
We confirmed enhanced cellular proliferation and viability in NHCV fibroblasts in response to 
NRG-1β, which was abrogated by PI3K, ErbB2, and ErbB3 inhibitors. NRG-1β also induced 
production and secretion of cytokines (interleukin-1α and interferon-γ) and pro-reparative factors 
(angiopoietin-2, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and crypto-1), suggesting a role in cardiac 
repair through the activation of paracrine signaling.

1. Introduction
Cardiac muscle is highly susceptible to injury caused by ischemia, inflammation, pressure 
overload and/or volume overload. Cardiac damage incurred during injurious processes, such 
as myocardial infarction (MI), results in the initiation of the wound healing processes in 
response to cardiomyocyte death leading to replacement of normal cardiac tissue with a stiff, 
collagenous scar. While this fibrotic scar is necessary to the integrity of the heart, its extreme 
rigidity and lack of functioning cardiomyocytes perturb the heart's natural mechanical 
properties, accelerating pathogenic remodeling and promoting development of heart failure. 
The conversion of fibroblasts to collagen-producing myofibroblasts (myoFbs) is a hallmark 
of cardiac tissue remodeling subsequent to injury, but their persistence after this initial 
healing phase contributes to adverse extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and collagen 
deposition that interferes with normal heart functions [1].
NRG-1β (neuregulin-1β) is an epidermal growth factor family member, which is absolutely 
required for embryonic heart development [2–5]. More recently, it has become evident that 
NRG-1β also plays a role in cardiac repair in the adult heart [4,6] and may contribute to the 
beneficial effects of exercise on cardiac and skeletal muscles [7,8]. The main source of 
NRG-1β in the heart is the cardiac microvascular endothelium [6,9]. Endothelial cell-derived 
NRG-1β is activated by proteolysis, after which it induces both autocrine and paracrine 
signals within the myocardium [10–14] and possibly distant signaling, as circulating levels 
are associated with ischemic and coronary artery disease [15,16].
NRG-1β transduces signaling in cardiac myocytes and endothelial cells via erythroblastic 
leukemia viral oncogene homolog tyrosine kinase receptors (ErbB2, ErbB3, and/or ErbB4). 
NRG-1β-bound ErbB4 forms a homo-dimer or hetero-dimerizes with one of the other 
ErbBs, leading to activation of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain and signal 
transduction. ErbB2 contains a functional tyrosine kinase domain but lacks a NRG binding 
site. ErbB3, on the other hand is kinase dead, but when bound by NRG-1β can dimerize with 
another ErbB receptor (typically ErbB2) and thereby relay the signal. Upon ligand binding, 
ErbB receptors are activated via autophosphorylation, which results in one of several 
downstream signaling cascades, dependent upon cell type and condition [17–19]. Known 
NRG-inducible cardiac signaling pathways include phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT, 
Ras/ERK, and Src/FAK [17–19]. In cardiomyocytes, for example, NRG-1β influences 
sarcomeric organization, induces proliferation, and increases survival [10,20–23]. In 
embryonic stem cells, NRG-1β promotes differentiation into cardiomyocytes [24–26]. 
NRG-1β can also influence blood pressure via the rostral ventrolateral medulla and 
modulate circulating immune cell functions [6].
Our laboratory previously reported improved cardiac function in both rat and swine models 
of myocardial infarction (MI) in animals treated with the glial growth factor 2 (GGF2) [27] 
isoform of NRG-1β, which contains a unique kringle domain in addition to the Ig-like and 
EGF-like domains that are common to other isoforms [19]. These studies led to the currently 
ongoing clinical trial examining the safety and tolerability of GGF2 in human subjects with 
systolic heart failure. We also demonstrated previously ErbB receptor expression and 
signaling in primary rodent cardiac stromal cells [27], as well as reduced fibrosis and

MyoFb percentages in remote-from-infarct cardiac tissues of post-MI swine [27]. These 
preliminary experiments suggested NRG-1β may regulate cardiac fibroblast signaling and 
activity.
In this study, we investigated the effects of NRG-1β treatment on primary human cardiac 
ventricular fibroblasts and herein describe the presence of functional ErbB signaling in 
human fibroblasts and involvement of NRG/ErbB in fibroblast-mediated signaling, a 
significant finding given their importance in cardiac remodeling.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Cell culture and reagents
Primary human cardiac ventricular fibroblasts (NHCF-V, cc-2904) were purchased from 
Lonza Walkersville Inc. (Walkersville, MD), expanded per manufacturer's protocol, and 
stored in 1 mL aliquots in Recovery Cell Culture Freezing Medium (Gibco/Thermo Fisher 
Scientific, Waltham, MA) in liquid nitrogen. All media, additives, and sub-culturing reagents 
were purchased from Lonza. Cells were routinely cultured in FGM-3 BulletKit (cc-cc4526), 
which includes Fibroblast Basal Medium (cc-3301) supplemented with FGM-3 SingleQuots 
(cc-4525). FGM-3 SingleQuots include recombinant human insulin (cc-4021), gentamycin 
sulfate amphotericin-B (cc-4081), and recombinant human fibroblasts growth factor-B 
(cc-4065). Expansion/splitting was accomplished by rinsing cells in HEPES Buffered Saline 
Solution (cc-5024) followed by detachment with Trypsin/EDTA Solution (cc-5012), 
inactivation of trypsin with Trypsin Neutralization Solution (TNS, cc-5002) and 
centrifugation at 1000g for 5 min. Unless otherwise stated, cells were serum-starved for 24 h 
followed by treatments in Fibroblast Basal Medium supplemented with gentamycin only (50 
µg/mL, 17–528Z, Lonza). A total of five different NHCF-V cell lines (cc-2904, Lonza) were 
used in this study. Donor characteristics are provided in Table 1.
2.2. RNA sequencing (RNASeq)
Total RNA was isolated using the RNEasy Midi kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) per 
manufacturer's instruction. Quality control, mRNA enrichment and cDNA library 
preparation were performed by the Vanderbilt Technologies and Genomics (VANTAGE) 
Core at Vanderbilt. RNA integrity was assessed using the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent). The 
Illumina Truseq RNA sample prep kit was employed for targeted analysis of polyadenylated 
transcripts. Paired-end sequencing was conducted on the Illumina HiSeq 2500. The resulting 
FASTQ data files for each sample were transferred to the Basespace Sequence Hub and 
aligned to the hg19 human reference genome assembly using the STAR aligner (Dobin et al., 
Bioinformatics 2012) with the following parameters: (1) pseudoautosomal regions masking, 
(2) mapping quality score of at least 37 (3) and paired end reads mapped to same 
chromosome with expected orientations.
Resulting BAM files were imported into Partek Genomics Suite 6.6 software, followed by 
quantification, normalization, and differential gene expression. Reads were quantified based 
on the RefSeq transcriptome, and normalized reads were represented as RPKM (Reads Per 
Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads).

2.3. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)
Total RNA was converted to cDNA with iScript (Bio-Rad). Pre-validated primers for human 
ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 receptors were purchased from Qiagen. Relative gene expression 
for each receptor was assessed using iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) in a 
Bio-Rad CFX instrument, according to manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, ~200 ng of cDNA 
was mixed with 2× supermix mix, RNase-free water and 1 µM of primers, for a total 
reaction volume of 10 µL. A typical protocol included for polymerase activation at 95 °C for 
30 s, and 40 cycles as follows: denaturation (5 s at 95 °C), annealing/extension (30 s at 
60 °C), followed by melt-curve analysis. The comparative threshold method used to 
calculate fold-differences in Excel. Pre-validated human GAPDH primers served as internal 
controls to normalize target gene expression across different samples. Levels of each ErbB 
receptor was analyzed at P0, P1, and P2 (where P0 = pre-passaged cells from Lonza before 
subsequent passage in our laboratory). The experiment was performed for three cell lines 
acquired from different individuals. At least three technical replicates were also included to 
ensure reproducibility.
2.4. Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (Millipore), supplemented with protease and phosphatase 
inhibitors (Roche) and mechanical disrupted using 29½ gauge needles (Becton Dickinson). 
Lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 RPM for 15 min followed by measurement of 
proteins in the resulting supernatants by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Proteins (30 µg/lane) 
were mixed with 4× loading buffer (Bio-Rad), loaded into 4–20% TGX polyacrylamide gels 
(Bio-Rad) and subjected to gel electrophoresis. Proteins were then transferred to PVDF 
membranes (0.45 µm pore size, Millipore) at 100 V for 1 h at 4 °C. Membranes were rinsed 
in tris-buffered saline (TBS) and then blocked in 5% blocking buffer in TBS with 0.1% 
Tween-20 (TBST) for 1 h. After washing in TBST, membranes were incubated with primary 
antibody diluted in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma) in TBST overnight at 4 °C. 
After additional washing, membranes were probed with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-
linked anti-rabbit antibodies (Cell Signaling Technologies) in 5% blocking buffer for 1 h at 
room temperature, washed again, incubated for 5 min with chemiluminescent reagent, and 
exposed to X-ray film. Supersignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Thermo 
Scientific) was used to detect phosphorylated ErbB2. All other proteins were visualized 
using Clarity Western ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad).
2.5. Immunoblot pathway arrays
The Human Phospho-kinase Proteome Profiler Array (ARY003B, R&D Systems, 
Minneapolis, MN) was used to detect phosphorylation of multiple kinases simultaneously, 
per manufacturer's directions. This panel includes 43 kinase phosphorylation sites, 2 related 
total proteins, 3 reference controls, and 1 negative control spotted in duplicate onto two 
separate membranes. Briefly, arrays were blocked with Array Buffer 1 for 1 h at room 
temperature, followed by incubation with ~200 µg of protein lysates (per membrane) 
overnight at 4 °C. All remaining steps, including washes, hybridization with primary and 
enzyme-linked secondary antibodies, and chemi-luminescence substrate exposure steps were 
accomplished the following day using manufacturer-provided instructions and reagents.

Blots were visualized using X-ray film with exposures ranging from 10 s to 10 min, 
followed by dark-room development and densitometry analysis using the reference spots for 
normalization. Negative control spots produced no detectable signal for any of the samples, 
even after 10 min of exposure time.
2.6. Flow cytometry
Cells were detached using StemPro Accutase (Gibco), counted and treated with Human 
TruStain FcX™ (Biolegend, San Diego, CA) to prevent non-specific binding. Cell surface-
expressed ErbB receptors were assayed using phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-human 
ErbB2/Her2 (Fab1129P) and IgG2B isotype-matched control (IC0041P), anti-hErbB3/Her3 
(Fab3481P) and IgG1 control (IC002P), or anti-hErbB4/Her4 (Fab11311P) and IgG2A 
(IC003P) isotype control as follows: 1 × 106 cells were incubated with 5 µL of each 
antibody in 100 µL of FACS buffer (0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA in PBS) for 30 min at 
4 °C. The cells were then washed 3 times with FACs buffer and immediately analyzed on a 
FACSCanto flow cytometer with DIVA software (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). 
Dead cells were eliminated from the analysis using 7-AAD (BD Phermingen). For each 
experiment, we gated on single live cells and used isotype controls for each fluorophore to 
establish the gates. Data analysis was done using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.).
2.7. Cell proliferation
BrdU Assay Kit #6813 (Cell Signaling) was used to detect BrdU incorporation, per 
manufacturer's instructions, as an assessment of cell proliferation. Briefly, ~10,000 cells/well 
were seeded into a 96-well plate and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were subsequently 
washed with HEPES and then exposed to various concentrations of NRG-1β with or without 
inhibitors for 24 h. Cells were then incubated with 1× BrdU for an additional 24 h, followed 
by fixation/denaturation (100 µL/well for 30 min at RT) and incubation with 1× detection 
antibody for 1 h. After washing, cells were incubated with HRP-linked secondary antibody 
for 30 min, washed again and then incubated with TMB substrate for 30 min before 
application of STOP solution. Absorbance at 450 nm was read using an Epoch microplate 
spectrophotometer (BioTek Instruments), followed by background subtraction and statistical 
analysis.
2.8. Cell survival
To induce stress-associated death, cells were exposed to various concentrations of hydrogen 
peroxide (H2O2) in media containing gentamycin and 2% serum. Cell viability was assessed 
using CellTiter Blue (Promega), per manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescence (560EX/
590EM) was subsequently measured using a GloMax 96 Microplate Luminometer 
(Promega).
2.9. Cytokines
The Proteome Profiler Human XL Cytokine Array Kit (ARY022, R&D Systems, 
Minneapolis, MN) was used to detect secreted cytokines, per manufacturer's directions. This 
panel includes 102 human cytokines, 3 reference controls, and 1 negative control spotted in 
duplicate onto a single membrane. NHCV fibroblasts obtained from 4 different individuals

were untreated or treated with 30 ng/mL of NRG-1β for 24 h, and 500 µL of cell culture 
supernatant was run on each array.
2.10. Statistics
All data are expressed as means ± SEM. Statistical comparisons made between two variables 
were performed using the Student's t-test (for pairwise comparisons). Comparisons between 
more than two variables were performed using one-way ANOVA with a Tukey's post hoc 
test. p-Values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. For RNASeq, Partek was 
used to perform pairwise comparisons of average group values and one-way ANOVA for the 
four groups. Only transcripts that resulted in a fold-change of at least 1.5 and p value of 
<0.05 were considered significantly altered.
3. Results
3.1. Human ventricular cardiac fibroblasts express ErbB receptors
We previously reported expression of neuregulin-1β (NRG-1β) receptors (ErbB2, ErbB3, 
and ErbB4) in rodent primary cardiac stromal cells [27]. To determine if normal human 
cardiac ventricular (NHCV) fibroblasts also express all three ErbB receptors, we employed 
three different approaches; first, we performed quantitative PCR (qPCR) on cells after three 
different passages. As shown in Fig. 1A, all three ErbB receptors are expressed by NHCV 
fibroblasts, and this expression was stable across passages. Second, we performed Western 
blot analysis and similarly found protein expression of ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 receptors 
(Fig. 1B). Third, we performed flow cytometry using a gating strategy that allowed us to 
select live single cells (Fig. 1C). We found that compared to the isotype controls, there was a 
marked increase in cell surface expression of ErbB2 (Fig. 1D), ErbB3 (Fig. 1E) and ErbB4 
(Fig. 1F). These results demonstrate that human fibroblasts express all three ErbB receptors 
on the cell surface at both a pre- and a post-transcriptional level.
3.2. NRG-1β induces pro-survival gene expression in NHCV fibroblasts
To determine the functional significance of ErbB receptor expression on human fibroblasts, 
NHCV cells from three different individuals were treated with NRG-1β for 6 h and RNA 
sequencing performed. Post-alignment analysis identified 776 transcripts as significantly 
altered between untreated and NRG-1β-treated fibroblasts, which upon hierarchical 
clustering distinguished between controls and treatments (Fig. 2A). As shown in Table 2, 
further analysis of these altered genes revealed enriched functions consistent with cellular 
proliferation and survival, including Ras signaling, regulation of apoptosis and cell death, 
and signaling pathways that are classically associated with cancer. Additionally, network 
analysis confirmed that proteins encoded by altered genes were functionally associated. 
Apoptotic genes that were found to be interrelated with one another via overlapping 
signaling pathways based on STRING Network analysis are shown in Fig. 2B. As expected, 
ErbB signaling was identified as an enriched signaling pathway in NRG-1β-treated 
fibroblasts (Table 2).
We next performed a screening assay to identify early phosphorylation events in NRG-1β-
treated NHCV fibroblasts, using duplicate spotted immunoblot protein arrays to compare

untreated versus NRG-1β-treated NHCV fibroblasts and detected significantly higher levels 
of phosphorylated AKT. Interestingly, PRAS40 and STAT3 were also phosphorylated in 
response to NRG-1β treatment (Fig. 2C). Pre-treatment with an ErbB3 blocking antibody 
(MAB3481) markedly reduced the levels of all three of these key phospho-signaling 
molecules (Fig. 2C). These results were reproducible and significant across three replicate 
experiments (Fig. 2D).
3.3. NRG-1β activates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway in NHCV 
fibroblasts
To examine the effect of NRG-1β on the PI3K/AKT pathway, NHCV fibroblasts were 
treated with recombinant NRG-1β for 30 min and the phosphorylation of two key amino 
acids of AKT assessed by Western blot analysis. As shown, NRG-1β treatment consistently 
induced phosphorylation of AKT at both serine (S)473 and threonine (T)308 (Fig. 3A and 
C). The NRG-1β-induced phosphorylation was consistently observed and statistically 
significant at both phosphorylation sites (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, these alterations were 
neither observed in NHCV cells exposed to the pro-fibrotic factor TGF-β, nor did TGF-β 
change the levels of phosphorylated AKT at S473 or T308 when the cells were treated with 
both NRG-1β and TGF-β (Fig. 3A). Pre-treatment of NHCV cells with the PI3K inhibitor 
LY40092 abolished phosphorylation of AKT at both S473 and T308 (Fig. 3B), indicating 
that NRG-1β activation of AKT in these cells is PI3K-dependent.
GSK-3β, a known downstream target of AKT kinase activity, was likewise phosphorylated 
in NHCV cells upon stimulation with exogenous NRG-1β (Fig. 4A and C). As was 
observed for AKT, TGF-β did not significantly affect the phosphorylation of GSK-3β when 
given alone or in conjunction with NRG-1β. Also, GSK-3β phosphorylation was 
significantly reduced in cells exposed to LY49002 (Fig. 4B and D), as was observed for 
AKT phosphorylation. Considered together, these results strongly suggest that NRG-1β 
activates the PI3K-AKT-GSK-3β signaling axis in human cardiac fibroblasts.
3.4. NRG-1β-induces ErbB3-dependent activation of ErbB2 in NHCV fibroblasts
We next measured ErbB receptor activation and found that ErbB3 receptor was 
phosphorylated at a key PI3K site (Tyr1289) in human fibroblasts treated with NRG-1β 
(Fig. 5A). Phospho-ErbB3 was not detectable in unstimulated NHCV cells (Fig. 5A), and 
NRG-1β-mediated induction was significant and reproducible by 20 min post-treatment 
(Fig. 5B). Inhibition of ErbB3 with MAB3481 suppressed AKT phosphorylation at S473 
and T308 (Fig. 5C, D).
We next examined ErbB2 activation, because NRG-1β/ErbB3 signaling requires 
dimerization with one of the other ErbB receptors, most typically ErbB2. ErbB2 receptor 
phosphorylation at Tyr1248 was detectable by Western blot analysis in NHCV fibroblasts 
treated for 20 min with NRG-1β (Fig. 6A). ErbB2 phosphorylation at Tyr1221/1222 was 
also present in response to NRG-1β (Fig. 6B). These phosphorylation events were 
dependent upon activation of ErbB3, as demonstrated by significant suppression of phospho-
ErbB2 Tyr1248 and Tyr1221/1222 levels by the ErbB3 inhibitor MAB3481 (Fig. 6).

3.5. NRG-1β enhances proliferation and survival of human cardiac fibroblasts
We next measured BrdU incorporation in NHCV fibroblasts and found a dose-dependent 
increase in cellular proliferation in response to NRG-1 β treatment (Fig. 7A). Similarly, 
NRG-1β increased human cardiac fibroblast survival in the presence of hydrogen peroxide 
(H2O2) (Fig. 7B). Blockade of PI3K (LY294002), ErbB3 (MAB3481), or ErbB2 (Lapatinib) 
suppressed NRG-1β-induced cell proliferation (Fig. 7A and C), as well as viability of 
fibroblasts exposed to 200 µM H2O2 (Fig. 7B and D).
3.6. NRG-1β induces secretion of cytokines from human cardiac fibroblasts
In the post-MI setting, proliferating fibroblasts are important for angiogenesis and other 
inflammatory-mediated reparative processes. We therefore screened the secretome in NHCV 
fibroblasts to identify NRG-1β inducible cytokines. In supernatants from NHCV cells 
treated for 24 h, we found induction of several cytokines, which were reproducibly secreted 
in response to NRG-1β treatment in three different fibroblast populations (Fig. 8A). 
Reproducible and statistically significant cytokines induced by NRG-1β treatment included 
angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), brain-derived neurotropic protein (BDNF), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), 
interleukin-1α (IL-1α), and Cryptic family 1 (Cripto-1) (Fig. 8B). Growth-related α protein 
(GROα) production and secretion, on the other hand, was inhibited by NRG-1β treatment in 
NHCV fibroblasts (Fig. 8).
4. Discussion
The present studies describe a new pathway of NRG-1β/ErbB receptor signaling in cardiac 
fibroblasts (Fig. 9). We demonstrate for the first time that NRG-1β induces phosphorylation 
of ErbB3 and ErbB2 receptors, resulting in activation of signaling in association with 
proliferative, pro-survival, and expression of cytokines with known roles in multiple 
processes, including recruitment of phagocytic immune cells, angiogenesis and activation of 
stem cells (Fig. 9). These findings have interesting and important implications for 
understanding the function of NRG-1β in the heart, including understanding how ErbB-
targeted therapies for cancer may alter cardiovascular function. As importantly, these 
findings have implications for the development of recombinant NRGs for the treatment of 
cardiovascular and other diseases.
NRG-1β/ErbB receptor signaling in cardiac cells has been well established, although the 
major focus to date has been on cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells. Our finding that ErbB 
receptor signaling occurs in human cardiac ventricular fibroblasts builds upon our previous 
work demonstrating ErbB receptor expression in rat and mouse cardiac stromal cells [27], as 
well as that by other investigators showing that ErbB receptor expression in fibroblasts from 
other tissues [28], most recently in skin fibroblasts [29,30].
It appears that all three ErbB receptors are expressed in normal NHCV fibroblasts and are 
functionally active. The main route of signaling activated by recombinant NRG-1β under the 
condition studied appears to be formation of ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimers, since inhibition of 
either of these receptors significantly reduced downstream signaling and functions. It is 
likely, however, that ErbB4 also contributes to NRG-1β-mediated signaling in fibroblasts,

because the ErbB3 blocking antibody reduced but did not eliminate ErbB2 phosphorylation. 
Whether ErbB4 activity in these cells occurs in conjunction with ErbB3-mediated signaling 
or is a compensatory consequence of ErbB3 inhibition will require further study. NRG-1β/
ErbB signaling might lead to feedback regulation of ErbB receptor expression in cardiac 
fibroblasts via endocytic downregulation or via ubiquitination and proteolysis, as suggested 
by previous studies of ErbB receptors [31]. It is also possible that cardiac fibroblast ErbB3 
or ErbB4 receptor is activated by other ligands, such as betacellulin, epiregulin, heparin-
binding EGF-like growth factor, or other forms of NRG (e.g., NRG-1α or NRG-2).
Increased proliferation and survival is a hallmark of NRG-1β-mediated signaling in a variety 
of cell types, but NRG-1β-stimulated production of cytokines in cardiac fibroblasts is a 
novel finding. Angiopoietin (Ang)-2 protein levels in supernatants from normal human 
cardiac ventricular fibroblasts obtained from three different individuals were significantly 
increased in response to NRG-1β administration (Fig. 8). Ang-2 is a tightly-regulated 
vascular growth factor important for postnatal angiogenesis [32,33]. In response to 
endothelial damage, dysfunction or ischemia, Ang-2 is released from activated endothelial 
cells and acts coordinately with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to destabilize the 
vasculature and promote angiogenesis [34–36]. During inflammation or angiogenesis, Ang-2 
acts as a partial antagonist of the Ang-1-Tie2 signaling system, which in essence “inhibits 
endothelial cell quiescence”.
BDNF, which was also induced by NRG-1β treatment, is a circulating neurotrophic cytokine 
that coordinates the regulation of energy homeostasis, including glucose metabolism in 
peripheral tissues, cardiovascular functions, and circadian rhythm [37]. BDNF has been 
well-characterized as a growth and pro-survival factor in a variety of cell types, including 
neurons [38], skeletal muscle stem cells, [39] and more recently cardiac progenitor cells 
[40]. BDNF also promotes angiogenesis, improves left ventricular function under ischemic 
conditions [41,42] and protects against adverse cardiac remodeling after myocardial 
infarction [43,44]. Plasma levels of BDNF were found to be significantly decreased in 
patients with heart failure, and circulating levels of BDNF levels were associated with 
cardiac disease severity [45].
Of note, we found that NRG-1β increases production of IFN-γ and IL-1α, which are potent 
immunomodulatory cytokines with pleiotropic effects, dependent upon cell type and context 
[46]. For example, IFN-γ is pro-inflammatory but can also induce autophagy and may 
thereby contribute to cardiomyocyte survival [47,48]. Similarly, IL-1α is triggered as part of 
the immune response after myocardial infarction, which initiates the phagocytic clearance of 
necrotic/apoptotic cells and debris and thus promotes cardiac repair [49].
We also found that NRG-1β mediates increased production of Cripto-1, a multifunctional 
embryonic protein that controls stem cell biology [50], including maintenance of postnatal 
stem cells (e.g., skeletal muscle satellite cells), epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition and 
tumorigenesis [51–53]. Cripto-1 is important for early heart morphogenesis [54], and is 
required for inducible differentiation of embryonic stem cells to a cardiac lineage [55,56]. 
Mice in which the Cripto-1 gene has been disrupted die in utero due to the inability of 
precardiac mesoderm to differentiate into functional cardiomyocytes [57]. Notably, Cripto-1

contains an EGF-like domain, which although incapable of direct binding to ErbB receptors, 
can indirectly enhance ErbB4 phosphorylation [58].
In contrast to the aforementioned cytokines, we found that NRG-1β induced downregulation 
of GROα in human cardiac fibroblasts. GROα (also called CXCL1), which is a ligand for 
CXC receptor 2 (CXCR2), a growth-related oncogene and chemoattractant for neutrophils 
[59,60], basophils [59], monocytes [61], and T cells [62]. GROα can induce the proliferation 
of endothelial cells in culture and angiogenesis in vivo [63,64]. Excessive GROα/CXCR2 
signaling, however, can lead to endothelial dysfunction and vascular lesions. GROα has 
been implicated in thrombin-induced angiogenesis [65], atherosclerosis [66], and aortic 
aneurisms [67] and may contribute to coronary artery disease [64].
To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate an important role of NRG-1β in 
regulating cardiac fibroblast signaling via the ErbB receptors leading to increased cell 
proliferation and survival. Since a known function of cardiac fibroblasts is to maintain the 
integrity of the cardiac extracellular matrix, the observed effects of NRG-1β on these cells 
suggest a role for ErbB signaling in the anti-fibrotic effects that have been observed in 
animal models of heart failure treated with recombinant NRG [27,68]. The modulatory 
effects of NRG/ErbB signaling on reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced fibroblast survival 
warrant further exploration, given the established role of ROS in activation of a pro-fibrotic 
phenotype in cardiac fibroblasts [69]. Further exploration of these effects are important to 
understand in the context of developing recombinant NRGs engineered to selectively 
activate ErbB4 homodimers [70], which may or may not be sufficient to alter fibroblast 
biology.
Although the cardiac fibroblasts used were of human origin, one significant limitation of this 
study is an inability to extrapolate our results to the in vivo cardiac environment. How 
NRG-1β signaling might regulate fibroblasts during post-MI remodeling is likely complex, 
and additional studies using co-cultures of fibroblasts with other cardiac cells, animal 
models and human fibroblasts obtained from diseased heart explants are clearly warranted. 
Possible mechanisms of action include NRG-1β-mediated reduction in injury-primed 
fibroblast activation and matrix deposition, alterations of fibroblast-cardiomyocyte 
interactions, and/or paracrine modulation of inflammatory cell activities through fibroblast 
production and secretion of immune cell regulatory factors.
In summary, we demonstrate mitogenic and pro-survival activities for NRG-1β in human 
cardiac ventricular fibroblasts, which to our knowledge have never been previously reported. 
These data suggest a mechanism of action for NRG-1β-mediated fibroblast signaling via 
ErbB2 and ErbB3 dimerization leading to the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway and 
secretion of cytokines (Fig. 9). Considered together, these data suggest that NRG-1β may 
contribute to cardiac repair through activation of paracrine signaling in fibroblasts (Fig. 9).

Downstream consequences of these NRG/ErbB3-induced signaling events include transcriptional alterations, 
enhanced cellular proliferation, and a decrease in H2O2-mediated cell death. Also shown are the downstream 
effects of NRG-1β signaling, including secretion of cytokines (IL-1α, IFN-γ, Ang-2, BDNF, and Cripto-1) that are 
known to play important roles in multiple processes, including recruitment of phagocytic immune cells, 
angiogenesis and activation of stem cells. The illustration was produced using ePath 3D software (Protein Lounge,

Model illustrating the intracellular signaling pathway leading to cell proliferation and 
survival in response to NRG-1β treatment. NRG-1β induces phosphorylation of the kinase-
dead ErbB3 receptor, which leads to recruitment and phosphorylation of the kinase active 
ErbB2 receptor. This leads to activation of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) with 
subsequent phosphorylation of protein kinase B (AKT) at serine (S)473 and threonine 
(T)308. AKT phosphorylates and inactivates GSK-3β, which participates in multiple 
signaling pathways, per the literature (paper icon).
