Abstract—Cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) is a promising
solution to improve the spectrum sensing performance. However,
some cooperative secondary users (SUs) may intentionally send
wrong spectrum sensing results for the benefit of themselves,
which will bring security problems to the CSS-enabled systems.
Besides, the behavior of the primary user (PU) may change
dynamically when SUs sense the spectrum, which affects the
accuracy of CSS. In this paper, a CSS architecture based on the
Tangle blockchain is proposed, where massive mobile devices
(MDs) act as spectrum sensing nodes and blockchain nodes.
A novel dynamic spectrum sensing algorithm is proposed based
on the mean-field game. A two-step spectrum sensing fusion
mechanism based on the age of information (AoI) and cumulative
weight (CW) of transactions is proposed to address the impact
of perceptual data differences on the overall decision. The
simulation results show that, compared with the traditional fixed
spectrum sensing strategy, the MDs’ weighted sensing utility in
the proposed dynamic spectrum sensing scheme is improved by
10% on average. Moreover, compared to the traditional maximal
ratio combining fusion mechanism, the detection probability of
the proposed two-step spectrum sensing fusion mechanism is
maximally increased by 30.23%, and the false alarm probability
is minimally reduced by 9.92%.

I. INTRODUCTION
W ITH the explosive growth in the number of mobile devi-
ces (MDs), the traditional static spectrum allocation and
management mechanisms have been considered as one of the
major obstacles to support resource-demanding services and
applications for next-generation wireless communication net-
works [1], [2]. Cooperative Spectrum Sensing (CSS) is regarded
as an effective solution to alleviate the spectrum shortage and
underutilization [3]. By allowing secondary users (SUs) to sense
the status of primary users (PUs) before accessing the licensed
spectrum [4], the throughput and utilization of spectrum resour-
ces of the SUs can be improved without causing adverse effects
to the PUs [5]. A fusion center can be deployed to fuse spectrum
sensing results of multiple SUs to further improve sensing accu-
racy. Recent results suggest that by adopting proper fusing rules
at the fusion center, the spectrum sensing accuracy can be signif-
icantly improved, even in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) sce-
nario [6]–[9]. However, most existing works only consider the
optimization of spectrum sharing strategies and often ignore the
security issues in sensing result fusion, e.g., somemalicious SUs
intentionally send wrong spectrum sensing results for the benefit
of themselves [10]. Besides, the centralized database maintained
by the fusion center may be vulnerable to the single point of fail-
ure. It is necessary to design a security-enhanced solution for
CSS that does not have to rely on a centralized result fusion.
Blockchain is considered to be a promising solution due to
its advantages of transparency, autonomy and traceability [11].
Based on the blockchain technology, all the spectrum sharing
interactions among entities in large-scale wireless networks
can be managed in a tamper-proof and decentralized way. The
consensus mechanism is a critical part of the blockchain, and
refers to the process of achieving agreement on the state of
data among the network participants [12]. Proof-of-work
(PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) are the two of the most com-
mon consensus mechanisms. Unfortunately, these two consen-
sus mechanisms suffer from low transaction throughput and
high transaction fees, making them unsuitable for spectrum
sharing in large-scale wireless networks [12]. The direct
acyclic graph (DAG) consensus mechanism is an emerging

solution that has the potential to relax the single-chain con-
straint. So the newly issued transactions can be quickly added
to the ledger, thus improving transaction throughput and con-
sensus delay of blockchain deployed in a large networking
system [13]. Tangle is a DAG consensus-based blockchain
solution. In Tangle, each transaction has an initial self-weight
and cumulative weight (CW). The self-weight of a transaction
is proportional to the amount of work that the issuing node
invested into it. The cumulative weight (CW) is defined as the
self-weight of a particular transaction plus the sum of self-
weights of all transactions that directly or indirectly approve
this transaction [14]. CW of transactions can reflect the accep-
tance of transactions by Tangle networks. The markov chain
monte carlo (MCMC) algorithm [15] is often adopted in Tan-
gle networks to add new transactions to the ledger. Compared
to PoW and PoS mechanisms, Tangle is a promising solution
to the blockchain scalability issues. Besides, Tangle offers
much faster transaction verification speed and improved trans-
action throughput, and is therefore a more suitable solution
when being applied into decentralized CSS in large-scale
wireless networks. None of existing studies investigate the
decentralized CSS based on Tangle networks.
When the sensing nodes in large-scale wireless networks
continuously increase, the application of classical game theory
to solve the optimal strategy of each sensing node will greatly
increase the complexity of the optimal strategy. Therefore, the
spectrum sensing mechanisms proposed in the existing CSS
studies are not suitable for the CSS in wireless networks with
a large number of sensing nodes. As a mathematical tool, the
mean field game is applicable for wireless networks with a
large number of game players [16]–[18]. The mean field game
is a promising solution to address the individual’s interaction
with the effect of collective behavior of players, and may
reduce the complexity of solving the optimized strategies in
large-scale wireless networks. It has already been applied to
optimize power control [19] and user scheduling [20], [21]
problems in wireless communication networks. However, the
mean field game is rarely applied in the research field of CSS.
Considering that the MDs need to consume energy in the CSS
and the energy of massive MDs is limited, the optimal spec-
trum sensing strategy of massive MDs should be dynamically
adjusted according to the change of residual energy. It is still
challenging to employ the mean field game to solve the opti-
mal sensing strategy of massive MDS with energy constraints.
Besides, an effective fusion mechanism in the CSS is
required to fuse the spectrum sensing results of all MDs when
the spectrum sensing process is performed by a large number
of MDs. In the current spectrum sensing process, the status of
PUs in the spectrum sensing can dynamically change, and the
sensing result can only reflect the current state of PUs’ occu-
pancy in the licensed spectrum. Age of information (AoI) is a
popular metric to measure the freshness of the received infor-
mation. It is defined as the time that elapsed since the last
update has been received. AoI of MDs’ sensing results is criti-
cal for the final fusion results in the CSS, as the fresh sensing
results are more consistent with the actual spectrum occu-
pancy situation. Outdated sensing results may lead to the
lower accuracy of the final sensing fusion results. There are
few studies considering the AoI in the fusion mechanism of
CSS.
To mitigate above challenges, in this paper, we develop a
novel CSS architecture based on the Tangle blockchain. In
this architecture, the dynamic spectrum sensing decision mak-
ing process is formulated as a mean field game. Besides, we
propose a new two-step spectrum sensing fusion mechanism
based on the AoI and CW of transactions in Tangle. The main
contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:
� A CSS architecture for the large-scale wireless net-
works is proposed based on the Tangle blockchain,
and each MD performs both spectrum sensing and
transactions consensus. All the spectrum sensing
interactions and results are recorded on blockchain
distributed ledger, which can resist MDs’ malicious
tampering behaviors.
� Given the limited energy and sensing utility function of
massive MDs, an optimal dynamic spectrum sensing
strategy for massive MDs based on the mean field game
is proposed.
� Considering that the state of PU changes dynamically
and perceptual data in different time slots have different
impacts on the overall decision, a new two-step spec-
trum sensing fusion mechanism based on the AoI and
CW of transactions is proposed.
� The simulation results demonstrate that, compared with
the traditional maximal ratio combining fusion mecha-
nism, the detection probability of the proposed two-step
spectrum sensing fusion mechanism can be improved
by 30.23%, and the false alarm probability can be
reduced by 9.92%.
The remaining of the paper is organized as follows. Related
works are described in Section II. The system model is given
in Section III. In Section IV, sensing utility expressions of
massive MDs are derived. In Section V, the process of solving
the optimization problem of sensing utility based on the mean
field game is introduced. In Section VI, the spectrum sensing
fusion mechanism based on the AoI and CW is designed. In
Section VII, numerical results of the proposed spectrum sens-
ing and fusion mechanism are analyzed. Finally, the paper is
concluded in the last Section.
II. RELATED WORKS
A. Cooperative Spectrum Sensing Schemes
There are some studies investigating the cooperative spec-
trum sensing. Some works focus on the deep learning-based
CSS. The authors in [22] proposed deep reinforcement learn-
ing-based CSS algorithm to decrease the signaling overhead
in the networks of SUs. To improve the sensing accuracy of
SUs, the authors in [23] proposed a cooperative sensing algo-
rithm, a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient algo-
rithm was employed to reduce the synchronization and
communication overhead. In [24], the authors proposed a fed-
erated learning-based spectrum sensing algorithm. Each SU
employs local data to train the neural network model and

sends the gradient to the fusion center to integrate the system
parameters. In [25], the authors combine CSS with deep learn-
ing to detect potential illegal drones with states of high uncer-
tainty. In [26], the authors employed the distributed deep
reinforcement learning method to learn the optimal CSS strat-
egy. The coordination graph is used to decompose the problem
into a max-plus problem. Considering that SUs may consume
energy when sensing spectrum, CSS needs to design an effec-
tive incentive mechanism to encourage SU to join in the CSS,
so as to maximize the spectrum sensing utilization [27]. The
authors in [28] proposed an incentive mechanism based on
contract theory, in which the interaction between SUs and
PUs has been formulated as a labor market. The authors
in [29] proposed a distributed dynamic load balancing cluster-
ing algorithm to reduce the network energy consumption and
improve the detection probability of spectrum sensing. The
game theory [30] has also been widely used in the design of
spectrum sensing mechanism in the CSS. An incentive mecha-
nism based on Stackelberg game is proposed in [31]. In the
Leader game, the fusion center motivates the sensing user to
join the CSS by providing the optimal reward. In the Follower
game, after receiving the reward issued by the fusion center,
the SUs can adjust its spectrum sensing strategy to get more
profits. The authors in [32] proposed a CSS incentive mecha-
nism based on non-cooperative game, and the authors in [33]
adopted the non-cooperative Nash-bargaining game for the
spectrum sensing benefit analysis of SUs and PUs in the CSS.
There are few existing studies focusing on the application of
blockchain to CSS [34]–[36], most of which introduce the
blockchain architecture based on PoW or PoS consensus. The
authors in [34] propose Sensechain, which uses the distributed
consensus mechanism in the blockchain network to capture
the reputation of SU, and identify the malicious SU based on
reputation evaluation. Similarly, the authors in [35] also use
blockchain to select spectrum sensing nodes. Besides, in order
to incentivize SU to participate in the spectrum senisng and
PoW process, the spectrum access opportunity is provided as
a reward for SUs, and the optimal strategy solution of this
sensing-access-consensus architecture is proposed in [36].
However, the applicability of traditional blockchain architec-
ture in terms of throughput and latency in large-scale CSS sce-
narios has not been widely considered in existing studies.
B. Fusion Mechanisms in Cooperative Spectrum Sensing
An effective fusion mechanism in the CSS is required to
fuse the spectrum sensing results of all MDs. The authors
in [37] derived the closed expression of detection probability
under different channel models, and simulated the perfor-
mance under different hard decision fusion rules. The authors
in [38] proposed a new hard decision fusion, which treated the
optimization result of cluster head’s non-cooperative game
sensing strategy as a necessary condition in the fusion mecha-
nisms. Simulation results show that this scheme can improve
the global detection probability and reduce the error detection
probability. A soft decision fusion scheme based on entropy
weight was proposed in [39], which divided SUs into different
clusters, and adopted equal weight fusion within clusters to
improve the detection probability. The detection probability
and false alarm probability of traditional Maximal Ratio Com-
bining (MRC), Selective Combining (SC) and other soft
fusion mechanisms are compared in [40].
III. SYSTEM MODEL
As shown in Fig. 1, the set of MDs is denoted as M ¼
f1; . . . ;m; . . .Mg, and the locations of MDs follows Poisson
distribution. The MDs are considered as spectrum sensing
nodes in the CSS. Without loss of generality, the Base Station
(BS) in the cellular network operated in the licensed spectrum
is regarded as PU. In this paper, a PU in the cellular network
is randomly selected to analyze the spectrum sensing utiliza-
tion in the large-scale CSS scenarios. Massive MDs not only
act as the spectrum sensing nodes in the CSS to jointly sense
the state of PU, but also act as the blockchain node in Tangle
networks to propose and validate transactions. There are
mainly three kinds of transactions in Tangle networks: tips,
unconfirmed and fully confirmed. Tips are newly attached
transactions that have not been referenced by other transac-
tions. Unconfirmed transactions are those waiting to be con-
firmed. Fully confirmed transactions are considered as
confirmed if they have already been directly or indirectly ref-
erenced by all tips. When a new transaction wants to join tan-
gle networks, it needs to reference and approve two existing
transactions. This rule defines the underlying structure of Tan-
gle networks. All nodes in Tangle networks can participate in
the consensus, which increases network security. Before the
spectrum sensing process, the PU will publish the smart con-
tract to Tangle networks, which define some basic rules about
spectrum allocation. During the spectrum sensing process,
MDs adopt different sampling frequency strategies to sense
the spectrum. As the reward for MDs to participate in the
CSS, the specific frequency band is allocated to MDs accord-
ing to the contribution of MDs in the way of Time division
multiple access (TDMA). After MDs make the spectrum sens-
ing strategies, MDs send transactions containing the spectrum
sensing strategy to Tangle networks. The transaction informa-
tion will be synchronized at every node in the Tangle network.
Then each MD can compute its own time allocation result
based on the smart contract published by PU and other MDs’
sensing strategies.
Without loss of generality, a frame structure for periodic
sensing by MDs was designed in this paper as shown in Fig 2.

Each frame Tf includes three parts: the sensing stage Ts, the
consensus stage Tc and the transmission stage Ttr. The length
of frame Tf satisfies Tf¼TsþTcþTtr. The MDs would con-
sume the energy during the sensing stage and the energy of
massive MDs is limited. Meanwhile, the dynamic change of
the PU’s state will influence the accuracy of the spectrum
sensing results. In this paper, the sensing stage Ts is divided
into the small instantaneous sensing time slots d. It is assumed
that each MD will dynamically adjust its sensing sampling
strategy according to its remaining energy in the instantaneous
sensing time slot d. When d is infinitesimal, it can be approxi-
mately regarded as a continuous sensing process. Therefore,
the sensing sampling strategy of the MD mðm 2 MÞ at the
time of tð0 � t � TsÞ is denoted as fmðtÞ.
The main architecture of this article is shown in Fig. 3. We
mainly focus on the CSS and spectrum fusion stage. In the CSS
stage, all MDs will sense spectrum based on mean field game
and send their sensing results as a transaction to the smart con-
tract in the Tangle, then step into the consensus stage. In the
spectrum fusion stage, a new two-step spectrum sensing fusion
mechanism based on the AoI and CW of transactions is pro-
posed. The first step is that MD performs local fusion, in which
sensing results of each time slot in the sensing stage is fused
based on AoI. Besides, all the transactions sent by MDs have
accumulated different CW during the consensus stage, thus the
second step of the fusion mechanism is to integrate the sensing
results of all MDs based on the CW. After the consensus, all
MDs step into the data transmission stage. This paper focuses
on the sensing and consensus stage, and the data transmission
stage is not within the scope of this paper.
IV. FORMULATION OF SENSING UTILITY FUNCTION
A. Sensing Utility Function
The access time of a specific frequency band (such as unli-
censed frequency band) is treated as a reward for MDs, and
the specific frequency band is allocated in the way of TDMA
according to the contribution of MDs. During the spectrum
sensing process, MDs adopt different sampling frequency
strategies. Higher sampling frequency may result in higher
detection probability, which also leads to more energy con-
sumption of MDs. So, the detection probability can reflect the
contribution of MDs in the CSS. Here, the detection probabil-
ity is the probability that MDs’ detection results are correct,
and is expressed as [6]

B. Mean Field Game Formulation
The optimal sensing strategy for MD is to maximize the
sensing utility function. At any time t, the control strategy set
Am is given by
Am ¼ fmðtÞ fmðtÞ 2 fmin; fmax½ �jf g; (6)
where fmðtÞ is the sensing sampling strategy of m in time t,
fmin is minimum sampling frequency and fmax is the maxi-
mum sampling frequency that MD can take. Since the remain-
ing energy of m is gradually reduced due to the continuous
sensing and sampling in the sensing process, the state
emðtÞð0 � emðtÞ � EmaxÞ of m is defined as the dynamic
change of the remaining energy with the time in the sensing
process.
emðtÞ ¼ Emax � psmfmðtÞd; (7)
whereEmax is the maximum sensing energy ofMDs during one
spectrum sensing progress. The change of state is expressed by
demðtÞ ¼ �psmfmðtÞdt: (8)
According to (8), the state of MD is controlled by a differen-
tial equation related to energy, and the optimization objective

The above optimization problem can be modeled as a sto-

V. OPTIMIZATION OF NETWORK SENSING UTILITY
A. Sensing Utility Derivation Based on Mean Field Game
In order to find the Nash equilibrium point above, the partial
differential equations with the same number of MDs has been
derived in this paper. When the number of MDs is large, it is
very difficult to solve the differential equations with a large
number. Thus, we use the mean field game [16] to solve the
problem of optimal sensing strategy for MDs in the CSS. The
mean field (MF)mðt; eÞ is expressed as
mðt; eÞ ¼ lim
M!1
1
M
X
8m
IfemðtÞ¼eg; (13)
where IfemðtÞ¼eg means that the value of the function is 1 when
the state of m at time t is e. MF is the probability distribution
of the state of MDs. The accuracy of the above approximation
increases by increasing the number of MDs, as the effect of
decision making to a single MD on the whole population
becomes negligible. Umeanðt; eÞ is the utility function under
MF in the time t and remaining energy e. Considering that the
receiver of MD moves within a certain range, the average of
Umeanðt; eÞ are obtained over the communication range of
MDs and is expressed as

In order to solve the optimal sensing strategy solution of the
above mean field game, the time axis and state space into a

Therefore, mðt; eÞ and V ðt; eÞ can be transformed into mði; jÞ

the jth point in state space. The numerical solution of the FPK

VI. NETWORK SENSING FUSION MECHANISM
A. Mechanism of Local Sensing Fusion Based on AoI
As can be seen from the previous section, the MD m will
obtain the optimal sensing strategy f�mðtÞ according to its util-
ity function at different time slots in the sensing stage. After
each MD conducts spectrum sensing according to the optimal
sensing strategy, the sensing results will be sent to the smart
contract in the form of transactions for the fusion of sensing
results. Considering the influence of the dynamic change of
PU’s state and the difference of sensing data in different time
slots on the overall decision results, a two-step mechanism of
spectrum sensing fusion based on AoI and CW is proposed in
this paper. In this section, the first step of fusion, namely the
mechanism of local spectrum sensing fusion based on AoI, is
introduced. In the sensing stage, the state of PU will change
over time. Thus, the current result of energy detection can bet-
ter reflect the real state of PU’s occupation of the authorized
channel than the previous result of energy detection. In the
previous section, we discretize the sensing time Ts into X
sensing time slots d, and calculate the optimal sampling fre-
quency of MDs under each sensing time slot d. Based on this,
the sensing number of m in the perception stage N times, that
is, N¼X. The sampling frequency of the ithði ¼1; 2; . . . ; NÞ
sensing of m is f�
mðiÞ, the total sampling number of the ith
sensing is MmðiÞ¼ f�
mðiÞd¼ f�
mðiÞ TsX , and the time of the ith
sensing is txmðiÞ.
As shown in Fig. 4, AoI of the sensing data in the ith sens-
ing is defined as the time aim from the end of the current sens-
ing txmðiÞ to the end of the whole sensing stage Ts, and aim is
expressed as aim ¼ Ts � txmðiÞ. The spectrum sensing result
with lower value of aim is more accurate than that with higher
value of aim, which means that the sensing results with lower
value of aim is more important for the local fusion result. So
we propose a weight indicator to measure the importance of
sensing results obtained during different time slot in the local
Fig. 4. AoI of local spectrum sensing data.

state of PU changes dynamically in different sensing time slots
in the whole sensing time Ts, and the state of PU remains
unchanged in the same sensing time slot d. According to refer-
ence [44], ymðiÞ is approximately a Gaussian distribution, and
its mean value and variance are as follows

H0 is the frequency band not occupied by PU, H1 is the fre-

To evaluate the performance of AoI-based local sensing
data fusion mechanism, we deduce the local sensing detection
probability Pdlocalm and false alarm probability Pflocal

under this mechanism.

To verify the correctness of the derived Pdlocalm , we carry out
numerical simulation analysis. According to the proposed
local sensing fusion mechanism based on AoI, 1 million times
of fusion sensing data are generated in this paper. The detec-
tion probabilities under numerical simulation are obtained by
comparing the fusion sensing data of 1 million times with the
detection threshold �. As shown in Fig. 5, we obtained the var-
iation curve of Pdlocalm with SNR in the theoretical derivation
and numerical simulation. We can see from Fig. 5 that the the-
oretical value Pdlocalm is basically consistent with the simula-
tion value, which further verifies the correctness of our
derivation process.
B. Global Sensing Fusion Mechanism Based on Transaction
Cumulative Weight
After the end of the sensing stage Ts, m sends a transaction
containing the local fusion sensing data ytotm to Tangle network
and enters the consensus stage Tc. Assuming that the CW
value of the transaction issued by m after the end of the con-
sensus stage Tc is denoted as cwm. The second step of the
fusion mechanism proposed in this paper is the global sensing
fusion mechanism based on the transaction CW. In this case,
the weight w2;m ofm’s local sensing data in the global sensing
fusion result is expressed as
w2;m ¼ cwmPM

The MD m issues a transaction at the beginning of the con-
sensus stage. Assuming that the transaction’s initial weight is
1. Then based on [14], [15], the growth of the mean value of
this transaction’s CW cwm is expressed as
Fig. 5. Local sensing detection probability Pdlocalm changes with SNR in the-
ory and numerical simulation.

where the time elapsed since the transaction was issued is
denoted as t, the CW at time t is denoted as cwmðtÞ, the time

Network is denoted as �, the number of tips expected in Tan-
gle network is expressed as L ¼2�h, the time dividing point
of cwm is expressed as t0¼ h

To get the distribution characteristics of CW values of dif-
ferent transactions at the same time t, we simulate the propa-
gation mode of transactions in Tangle network and design a
growth Algorithm 2 for transaction CW values at different
times.
The totally time sampling points is denoted as t num, the
CW of tips transaction is denoted as tips:weight, generation
time of tips transaction is denoted as tips:time, current time
is denoted as now, the number of current tips transactions is
denoted as sizeðtipsÞ, generating a random number in the
range of 1 � size is denoted as randomðsizeÞ, the two trans-
actions referenced by the newly generated tips transaction are
denoted as new tx:pre1 and new tx:pre2, generation time of
the new transaction is denoted as new tx:time.
In this paper, the Algorithm 2 is repeated for 10000 times to
simulate the growth and change of transaction CW and its dis-
tribution curve at different time, and compares with the theo-
retical derivation value of (38). The simulation results are
shown in Fig. 6. As can be seen from Fig. 6(a), the average
value of transaction CW derived from (38) is basically consis-
tent with the simulated value of CW obtained from Algorithm
2 proposed in this paper, thus verifying the effectiveness of
Algorithm 2 proposed in this paper. It can be seen from Fig. 6
(b) that the CWs of all transactions issued at the same time
approximately follow the Poisson distribution. Thus, the Algo-
rithm 2 can be used to effectively simulate the growth process
of CW of transactions issued by all MDs including local fused
perception data ytotm at the beginning of the consensus stage Tc,
so as to get a set of data subject to Poisson distribution to
approximately represent CW of transactions issued by differ-
ent MES at the end of the consensus stage Tc. By substituting
this set of CW data values into (36), we can get the weight
w2;m ofm in global spectrum sensing fusion. According to the
expressions of the mean value and variance of m’s local sens-
ing fusion result ytotm derived in the previous section, in this
section, when PU is in the state of H1, the expectation

C. Signaling Overhead of the Tangle-Based Spectrum
Sensing and Fusion Mechanism
The signaling overhead is evaluated by the number of mes-
sage interactions in the proposed tangle-based networks.
Before the spectrum sensing, the PU needs to publish the
smart contract to tangle networks, which defines some basic
rules about spectrum allocation. Such transactions need to be
transmitted to all MDs, so the number of interactions between
the PU and MDs is M. When MDs get their optimal spectrum
sensing strategy, MDs need to send transactions containing
the spectrum sensing strategy to tangle networks, which need
to be known by other MDs and PU. We assume that every MD
relays any recent transaction data to all its neighbors by the
device-to-device communication. The number of message
interactions required to synchronize the transaction data to all
MDs and PU is OðMlogMÞ. Then, each MU can obtain its
own available access time of specific frequency band based on
the smart contract and other MUs’ spectrum sensing strategies.
So the overall interaction caused in the tangle transaction is
M þOðMlogMÞ.
VII. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
In this section, the performance simulation is carried out for
the optimization of the sensing strategy based on the mean
field game and the spectrum sensing fusion mechanism based
on AoI and transaction CW proposed in this paper. The related
parameters are shown in Table I [14], [45].
For intuitive analysis, the optimal sampling frequency f� of
MDs in different time slots by time slot d is multiplied to get
the optimal sensing sampling times of MDs in different time
slots. Fig. 7 shows the change of the optimal sensing sampling
times of MDs with time and remaining energy of MDs. It can
be seen from Fig. 7 that with the increase of time and the
decrease of remaining energy of MDs, the optimal sensing
sampling times of MDs also decrease. To more intuitively dis-
play the simulation results in Fig. 7, the variation of the sam-
pling size of MD with the remaining energy state of MDs at
three different times of 0 s, 0.5 s and 1 s are shown in Fig. 8
(a). It can be seen from Fig. 8(a) that under the same

the increase of time. At the same time, the sampling size of
MDs increases with the increase of the remaining energy. This
is because when the remaining energy of MDs is large, there
is enough energy to increase the sampling number of MDs.
Meanwhile, Fig. 8(b) shows the change curve of sampling size
of MDs with time under three different remaining energy
states 0 J, 1 J and 2 J. It can be seen from Fig. 8(b) that the
changes of sampling sizes of MDs with time and remaining
energy state are consistent with that of Fig. 8(a).
Fig. 9 shows the variation curve of mean field with time and
the remaining energy of MDs. As can be seen from Fig. 9, as
time increases, the proportion of MDs in the state of low
remaining energy becomes smaller and smaller. To explain
the simulation results in Fig. 9 more intuitively, the change of
MF with the remaining energy of MD at three different time
of 0 s, 0.5 s and 1 s, and the change of MF with time at three
different states of 0 J, 1 J and 2 J are shown in Fig. 10. As can
be seen from Fig. 10(a), as time goes by, the proportion of
MDs in the state of low remaining energy keeps increasing,
while the proportion of MDs in the state of high remaining
energy gradually decreases. This is because as time goes by,
MDs keep sampling and consuming energy, and MDs in the
state of high remaining energy gradually decrease. When the
remaining energy of MD is around 0.6 J, the proportion of
MDs with t ¼ 0 s and those with t ¼ 1 s are the same. Simi-
larly, when the remaining energy of MD is around 1.2 J, the
proportion of MDs with t ¼ 0 s and those with t ¼ 0:5 s are
the same. As can be seen from Fig. 10(b), when the time is
fixed, the proportion of MDs with remaining energy of 0 J is
higher than that of MDs with remaining energy of 1 J and 2 J.
The proportion of MDs with remainign energy of 0 J increases
with the increase of time, because the remaining energy of
MDs is constantly exhausted with the increase of time. The
proportion of MDs with the remaining energy of 1 J increases
first and then decreases with the increase of time. This is
because, as shown in Fig. 8(b), the sampling times of MDs
with the remaining energy of 1 J is at a relatively high value.
When the time is less than 0.7 s, MDs with remaining energy
greater than 1 J keep a high sampling frequency and constantly
consume energy, so that the proportion of MDs with remain-
ing energy of 1 J increases. When the time is greater than
0.7 s, the proportion of MDs with the remaining energy of 1 J
begins to decrease gradually, thus forming a change trend of
increasing first and then decreasing. For MDs with a remain-
ing energy of 2 J, since all MDs consume energy through sens-
ing sampling and the initial residual energy of MDs is 2 J, as
time increases, the proportion of MDs with a remaining
energy of 2 J will decrease sharply until it reaches 0.
In order to better reflect the effectiveness of the variable
sensing sampling strategy proposed in this paper, the overall
weighted sensing utility under the mechanism proposed in this
paper is compared with the value of the fixed sensing sampling
strategy at a certain moment. At time iði ¼ 1; 2; . . . ; XÞ, the
overall weighted utility Utol;i of the network is expressed as

pling strategy is fmax, and the simulation results are shown in

sensing sampling strategy proposed in this paper is adopted,
the overall weighted sensing utility of the network basically
remains stable. Compared with the fixed sensing sampling
strategy, the weighted sensing utility of the proposed strategy
is increased by 10% on average. Moreover, the weighted sens-
ing utility of the strategy proposed in this paper is always
higher than that of the fixed strategy in the whole time period,
which indicates that the dynamically regulated sensing sam-
pling strategy proposed in this paper can maintain good sens-
ing utility even when large-scale MDs is in a state of low
remaining energy as a whole.
In this paper, the weighted sensing detection probability of
network Pdnet tol is used as a performance index to compare
and analyze the performance differences between the dynamic
regulation sensing sampling strategy proposed in this paper
and the fixed sensing sampling strategy. The weighted sensing
detection probability of network Pdnet tol is the weighted sum
of detection probabilities of MEs in different states at time

where the detection probability under the condition that the
sampling strategy is the optimal strategy solution f�ði; jÞ at
time i and j is denoted as Pdði; jÞ.
Fig. 12 shows the simulation results of Pdnet tol under dif-
ferent values of g. It can be seen from Fig. 12 that Pdnet tol of
the sensing sampling strategy proposed in this paper is basi-
cally stable in the whole sensing period. At the initial time,
Pdnet tol of the strategy proposed in this paper is less than that
of the fixed strategy. However, with the increase of time,
Pdnet tol of the strategy proposed in this paper will be better
than that of the fixed strategy when g corresponds to -5 dB,
0 dB and 5 dB, and the time corresponds to 0.5 s, 0.2 s and 0 s.
To evaluate the performance of the proposed spectrum sens-
ing fusion mechanism based on AoI and transaction CW, the
performance of the local spectrum sensing fusion mechanism
based on AoI was simulated. Fig. 13 shows the variation curve
of local detection probability with SNR and false alarm proba-
bility. Fig. 13(a) shows the variation curve of local detection
probability with SNR. It can be seen from Fig. 13(a) that the
local detection probability increases with the increase of SNR.
When SNR is -10 dB, compared with the equal-weight fusion
mechanism, the AoI-based local sensing fusion mechanism
proposed in this paper has the largest percentage improvement
of detection probability, which is 42.13%. Fig. 13(b) shows
the relationship curve between local detection probability and
false alarm probability, and the SNR at this time is set to
-10 dB. It can be seen from Fig. 13(b) that the local detection
probability increases with the increase of false alarm probabil-
ity. Under the same false alarm probability, the detection
probability of AoI-based local sensing fusion mechanism pro-
posed in this paper is higher than that of the equal-weight
fusion method.
Fig. 14 shows the variation curve of local false alarm proba-
bility and local error probability with SNR. It can be seen from
Fig. 14(a) that the local false alarm probability decreases with
the increase of SNR and b. When SNR is -6 dB, the false
alarm probability of AoI-based local sensing fusion mecha-
nism almost drops to 0, while the false alarm probability of
the equal-weight fusion method is 0.2097. The false alarm

probability of AoI-based local sensing fusion mechanism pro-
posed in this paper is 99.61% lower than that of the equal-
weight mechanism. Fig. 14(b) shows that the local error prob-
ability decreases with the increase of SNR, where the local
error probability is defined as Pelocalm ¼ 1� Pdlocalm þ Pflocal
m .
As can be seen from the Fig. 14(b), under the same SNR val-
ues, the overall error probability of AoI-based local fusion
mechanism proposed in this paper is less than that of equal-
weight fusion mechanism. This is because when considering
the state of the PU dynamic variable, the closer to the end of
the sensing of sensing data will be closer to the real state of
PU. When local fusion based on AoI is adopted, the final result
of global sensing fusion will be more accurate, and the overall
error probability will be smaller.
Fig. 15 shows the global detection probability of the two-
step spectrum sensing fusion mechanism based on AoI and
transaction CW changes with the mean of SNR and false
alarm probability. The distance between PU and MDs follows
the Poisson distribution. When given transmit power and noise
level, we can obtain the probability distribution function of
SNR [46]. The proposed fusion mechanism is compared with
traditional Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC), Selection
Combing (SC) and Square-Law Selection (SLS). In MRC,
each signal branch is multiplied by a weight factor that is pro-
portional to the signal amplitude. The SC scheme is a soft
fusion scheme that directly selects the branch with the

maximum SNR in the selection combiner. The SLS scheme
only selects the branch with the largest remaining energy. It
can be seen from Fig. 15(a) that under the same mean of SNR,
the global detection probability of the sensing fusion mecha-
nism proposed in this paper is higher than that of the tradi-
tional MRC, SC and SLS mechanism. When SNR is -8 dB,
the global detection probability of the two-step sensing fusion
mechanism proposed in this paper is 1, and the detection prob-
ability of the MRC, SLS and SC mechanism are 0.4513,
0.2764 and 0.003, respectively. Fig. 15(b) shows the change
of global detection probability with false alarm probability. It
can be seen from Fig. 15(b) that global detection probability
increases with the increase of false alarm probability. Com-
pared with the traditional MRC mechanism, the proposed
two-step spectrum sensing fusion mechanism based on AoI
and transaction CW has the highest global detection probabil-
ity improved by 30.23%.
Fig. 16(a) shows the change of global false alarm probabil-
ity with mean of SNR. As can be seen from Fig. 16(a), under
the same average SNR, the global false alarm probability of
the sensing fusion mechanism proposed in this paper is lower
than that of the traditional MRC, SC and SLS mechanism.

probability with SNR. As can be seen from Fig. 16(b), the
global error probability of the sensing fusion mechanism pro-
posed in this paper is smaller than that of the MRC mechanism
under the same average SNR. When the mean of SNR is
-14 dB, the global error probability of the proposed two-step
sensing fusion mechanism is 21.8% lower than that of the
MRC mechanism.
VIII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, the CSS architecture based on Tangle
blockchain is constructed. Massive MDs act as spectrum
sensing nodes and blockchain nodes, and the spectrum sens-
ing results are sent to the smart contract in the form of
transactions without the introduction of traditional fusion
center. Considering the energy limitation of massive MDs
in the CSS and the optimization demand of sensing utiliza-
tion, a novel algorithm that can improve the spectrum sens-
ing results of massive MDs in dynamic environment has

been proposed based on the mean field game. We also pro-
pose a new two-step spectrum sensing fusion mechanism
based on the AoI and CW of transactions to address the
impact of perceptual data differences in different time slots
on the overall decision. The simulation results show that,
compared with the traditional fixed spectrum sensing strat-
egy, the proposed dynamic spectrum sensing strategy can
improve the sensing utility of massive MDs when the resid-
ual energy is low, and the weighted sensing utility of mas-
sive MDs is improved by 10% on average. Moreover,
compared to the traditional soft fusion mechanism, the
detection probability of the proposed two-step spectrum
sensing fusion mechanism based on the AoI and CW is
maximally increased by 30.23%, and the false alarm proba-
bility is minimally reduced by 9.92%.
APPENDIX A
PROOF OF THEOREM 1
The Nash equilibrium solution of stochastic differential
game can be obtained by solving the above HJB equation [41].
Thus, the existence of Nash equilibrium can be proved by
proving that (12) is solvable.
According to reference [43], the Hamiltonian equation
related to (12) is expressed as
H em;
@Vm t;emðtÞð Þ
@e

fm t;emð Þ
Um fm t;emð Þð Þ � psmfm t;emð Þ @Vm t;emðtÞð Þ
@e
� � :
(47)
Equation (12) is solvable only if (47) is solvable, and (47) is solv-
able only if Hamiltonian is smooth. Substituting (5) into (47) can
be obtained as shown in (48) as shown at the bottom of this page.
In which the differential variable of (48) is denoted as fmðt;emÞ.
Since Vmðt;emðtÞÞ, Rm and
PM
j¼1 Pdjðfjðt;ejÞÞ are independent
of the specific sensing strategies of MD, their derivatives
with respect to fmðt;emÞ are 0. The derivative of
Pdmðfmðt;emÞÞ with respect to fmðt;emÞ is expressed in
(49), shown at the bottom of the page. It can be seen from
(49) that the first derivative of Pdmðfmðt;emÞÞ with respect
to fmðt;emÞ exists, and the first derivative is an elementary
function, then any derivative of Pdmðfmðt;emÞÞ with respect
to fmðt;emÞ exists. So any derivative of Hðem; @Vmðt;emÞ
@e Þ with
respect to fmðt;emÞ exists, that is, Hamiltonian is smooth for
fmðt;emÞ, and Nash equilibrium solutions for stochastic dif-
ferential games exists.
APPENDIX B
PROOF OF THEOREM 2
According to the character of the Gaussian distribution,
the local fusion sensing result ytotm of m follows the Gauss-
ian distribution. From the definition of detection probabil-
ity, the expression of detection probability can be obtained
in (34). We next derive the expression for E½ytotm jH1� and
D½ytotm jH1�.
Considering the dynamic change of PU’s state, in this paper,
it is assumed that the sensing data of the last uðu ¼ 0; 1;
2; . . . ; NÞ continuous time slots in N sensing time slots is a
Gaussian distribution under the condition of H1, and the value
of u is a uniform distribution with probability of 1
Nþ1 . The sens-
ing data of theN�u time slot follows the Gaussian distribution
under the condition of H0. The probability of the sensing data
of the 1 � ðN�u�1Þ time slot following the Gaussian distribu-
tion under the condition ofH0 is 1/2, and the probability of fol-
lowing the Gaussian distribution under the condition of H0 is
1/2. Based on the above hypothesis, the mean value of the sens-
ing data of the last u time slots is expressed asPN

the final state of PU at the end of sensing isH1, the mean value
E½ytotm jH1� of ytotm is expressed in (50), as shown at the bottom

where E½ytotm jH1�2 can be calculated according to (52),
shown at the bottom of this page. There are some condi-
tions that we should consider: 1) When u ¼ N , that is, the
sensing data of all the sensing time slots follow the Gauss-
ian distribution under the condition of H1. E½ðytotm Þ2jH1� is
expressed in (53), as shown at the bottom of this page; 2)
When u ¼ 0, that is the sensing data of the Nth time slot
follow the Gaussian distribution under the condition of
H0, the sensing data of the 1 � ðN�1Þ time slots have a
probability of 1/2 to follow the Gaussian distribution under
the condition of H0, and the probability of 1/2 to follow
the Gaussian distribution under the condition of H1.
E½ðytotm Þ2jH1� is expressed in (54), shown at the bottom of
this page; 3) Similarly, when u 6¼ 0 and u 6¼ N ,
E½ðytotm Þ2jH1� is expressed in (55), shown at the top of the
next page. Substituting E½ðytotm Þ2jH1� in different cases into
(51), the variance D½ytotm jH1� of ytotm and the expression for
Pdlocalm can be obtained.
APPENDIX C
PROOF OF THEOREM 3
Similarly, it is assumed that in N sensing time slots, the
sensing data of the last vðv ¼0; 1; 2; . . . ; NÞ continuous time
slots follow the Gaussian distribution under the condition of
H0, and the value of v follows the uniform distribution with
a probability of 1
Nþ1 . Then the sensing data of the N�vth
time slot follow the Gaussian distribution under the condi-
tion of H1. In the 1 � ðN�v�1Þ time slots, the probability
of the sensing data following the Gaussian distribution
under the condition of H0 is 1/2, and the probability of the
sensing data following the Gaussian distribution under the
condition of H1 is 1/2. Similar to the derivation of the
mean value in Pdlocalm , E½ytotm jH0� is expressed in (56),
shown at the top of the next page. Similarly, according
to D½ytotm jH0�¼E½ðytotm Þ2jH0��E½ytotm jH0�2, E½ytotm jH0�2 is
expressed as: 1) When v ¼ N , E½ðytotm Þ2jH0� is expressed in
