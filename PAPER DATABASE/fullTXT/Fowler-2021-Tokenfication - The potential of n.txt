ABSTRACT
In recent years, there has been an increase in the interest in non-
fungible tokens (NFT) to purchase digital art and has shaped a new
form of art collecting. The art community has a long history of
challenges and opportunities with the commercialization of art.
More recently, there has also been an interest in the purchase of
game art as investments or collecting.With the advent of blockchain
currencies, NFTs have introduced a way for investors, collectors,
and game developers to purchase or sell game art. However, the
potential of NFT for the games and game development industry is
manifold. In this paper, the authors will reflect on the potential of
NTF’s for game developers and content creators.

1 INTRODUCTION
The use of blockchain technologies to create tokens has created
opportunities for game developers, investors, and content creators.
With newspaper articles such as the one in the New York Times [52]
citing a multi-million dollar sale of digital art with Non-Fungible
Tokens (NFTs), the interest in using blockchain technologies for
selling and buying digital products is increasing.
The initial development of a blockchain to protect provenance,
ownership, distribution, and control of artworks was created in
2014 by Kevin McCoy and Anil Dash [15]. The intention of this
technology was to give artists a tool to exercise control over their
work, to facilitate the process of commercializing it, and to protect
against others appropriating it without permission [15]. Due to the
limitations of blockchains, it is not possible to store a digital version
of an artwork in a blockchain. The blockchain includes a link to

the work. The link either points to a URL or an InterPlanetary File
System (IPFS) hash. In most circumstances, it references an IPFS
gateway on the Internet run by the organization that sold the NFT.
Tokens have been used as a form of currency for many years.
Early on, tokens have been used to pay for goods and are still used
in casinos, video game arcades, to pay for public transport, and
shopping cart rentals. The use of digital tokens based on blockchain
technologies has created considerable opportunities and challenges
for the art and game development community.
The art world is no stranger to the potential challenges and
opportunities in the commercialization of art. The art community
has long debated the challenges of the commercialization of art.
There are those that argue that art should not be limited to the
domain of wealthy investors or museums, but art should be able
(and available) to be enjoyed by everyone. On the other side, some
argue that artists should make a living for their craft.
As digital art can be so easily replicated, it is difficult to identify
authenticity. For example, the business of collecting signatures of fa-
mous people is rife with counterfeits. In several cases, the creator of
the signatures has provided free authenticity services. Mark Hamill,
for example, verifies his autograph through his Twitter account.
However, given how easy it is to copy an authentic signature and
copy it onto a non-autographed piece of art, it is possible that even
the original author can’t identify these fakes.
In video games, the value of digital game objects is becoming
increasingly more relevant, and the interest to collect game objects
is multifaceted. Livingston et al. [32] explore in their work different
types of value that in-game characters provide to players. They
define utility, investment, communication, memory, enjoyment,
representation of relationships, new experience, creativity, sociabil-
ity, and self-expression as types of value for game characters. This
work has been used by Tondello et al. as a basis to better understand
the value of digital game objects [55]. In their study, they noticed
an association between the game genre and the different reasons.
They also found that utility, enjoyment, investment, self-expression,
and memory are the most frequent reasons for valuing digital game
objects. Especially for reasons such as investment or collecting,
ways to verify the authenticity of digital game objects are becom-
ing increasingly relevant. As a result, we should take a closer look
at the potential, in this work, we want to open the discussion on
the potential of blockchain technologies for digital game objects
and game development.
2 BLOCKCHAIN
According to [59], "blockchains are tamper-evident and tamper digi-
tal ledgers implemented in a distributed fashion and usually without
a central authority." Blockchains facilitate transactions via a shared
ledger within that community.

The benefits of blockchain technologies are decentralized, trans-
parent, open-source, immutable, and provide anonymity [31]. The
challenges of blockchain technologies are scalability, interoperabil-
ity, consume considerable amounts of energy, lack standardization,
and lack of regulation [31, 48, 60].
Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are fungible. That is, any (bit)coin
is equivalent to any other (bit)coin (just like currency). However,
unlike Bitcoin, non-fungible tokens are unique to each other. Ini-
tially, based on the Ethereum blockchain standard, NFTs have been
created for digital art, games, trading cards, or virtual land (see
https://nonfungible.com/ for examples).
2.1 Proof of Work (POW) or Proof of Stake
(PoS).
Proof of Work (PoW) is a system that requires a significant but fea-
sible computational effort that has been expended for some purpose
[38] and prevents double-spends [22]. A double spend is where the
same funds are being spent more than once [40]. Currencies like
Bitcoin and Ethereum can be processed in a peer-to-peer network
securely without the need for verification by a third party. How-
ever, due to the way PoW currencies work, they use considerable
amounts of power, leading to a significant carbon footprint [41, 56].
With the current standard, a single transaction requires a lot of
resources.
An alternative system is Proof of Stake (PoS). With the PoS, a
set of nodes stake their own cryptocurrencies for the transaction
validation. The benefit of the PoS algorithm is that the network
already exists, there is no need for mining, and the need to solve a
complex cyrptographic puzzle is eliminated [45]. As a result, this
standard can be described as more environmentally friendly.
2.2 The Ethereum Blockchain
To address the challenge of the scalability of blockchains, the Ethereum
blockchain was created [58]. The Ethereum blockchain was based
on a decentralized system and potentially reducing the amount of
time to verify [20, 45].
In 2013, Vitalik Buterin conceived the Ethereum network as a
fully decentralized, public blockchain [12]. The Ethereum project
was launched on July 30, 2015 [54]. Unlike the Bitcoin blockchain
code, which provides a set of established operations, Ethereum is
considered as a platform and a programming language running on
a blockchain [53, 58].
The EthereumRequest for Comments (ERC) provides application-
level standards for developers to recommend a change or token
standard to refine and develop the software protocol. The ERC-20
standard lists the minimum instructions to create a token consistent
with the general class of identical tokens (they are fungible). ERC-
721 describes and defines tokens, where each token is distinct (aka
non-fungible) and enables the tracking of distinguishable assets.
According to ERC-271, each asset must have its ownership individ-
ually and atomically tracked. The ERC-1155 standard allows for
the management of any combination of fungible and non-fungible
tokens in a single contract, including transferring multiple token
types at once [16].
Alternative blockchains used for NFTs include the Tezos Blockchain
[6] and the Flow Blockchain [6] and the Flow Blockchain [5]. The
Tezos Blockchain provides a peer-to-peer layer that ensures connec-
tivity with other nodes and then passes the received messages to
another layer that addresses this network as a distributed database
[6]. The Flow Blockchain was initially developed to address some
Ethereum Blockchain limitations, which was caused by the volume
of trading of CryptoKitties [14].
2.3 Smart Contract
Smart contracts are computer protocols intended to facilitate, verify,
or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract [33, 57].
Szabo [50] defined smart contracts as "a set of promises, including
protocols within which the parties perform on the other promises. The
protocols are usually implemented with programs on a computer net-
work or in other forms of digital electronics, therefore these contracts
are "smarter" than their paper-based ancestors. No use of artificial
intelligence is implied". NFTs are classified as smart contracts due
to how the Blockchain standard is implemented [33].
3 THE POTENTIAL FOR GAMES
In games and game-related industries, the ownership of digital items
becomes increasingly essential. This is confirmed by the results by
Livingstone et al. [32] who, describe that digital objects have dif-
ferent values to players such as utility, investment, communication,
memory, enjoyment, representation of relationships, new experience,
creativity, sociability, and self-expression. One major benefit of pro-
viding incentives in games is to motivate the player [10, 11]. The
intrinsic or extrinsic rewards have been shown to motivate the
player to play the game for longer and to play the game in the
future [10, 43]. Scholten et al. [46] posit that cryptocurrencies like
the Ethereum blockchain have enormous potential to keep players
engaged in playing games. Komiya and Nakajima [28] proposed a
possible blockchain to motivate the player through achievements.
Use cases include collecting and distributing rare in-game items,
collectibles, objects created by users, gifts, or signed items by eSport
players or streamers. The following sections, introduce and discuss
relevant use cases for tokenfication (defined by the authors as the
introduction and use of NFTs to represent digital assets), especially
for game developers.
3.1 Tokenfication
The authors describe Tokenfication as the introduction and use of
NFTs to represent digital assets. In this paper, the authors focus on
the tokenfication of game assets. We suggest that by creating the
verb into a noun, the term describes the multiple uses (and misuse)
of tokens in games.
3.2 Crypto-assets and Collectibles
The practice of collecting physical objects for fun includes nostalgia,
connection to a historical period or point in time, prestige, or profit
is not new [35]. While many individuals have collected digital assets
for some time, NFTs have enabled the collection and trading of these
items.
InMassivelyMultiplayer Online Role-PlayingGames (MMORPG),
players acquire in-game assets (or loot) as a result of gameplay, suc-
cessful quests, or by purchasing them from within (or outside) the
in-game store [17, 24, 26]. This system provides an opportunity for
153
https://nonfungible.com/
Tokenfication - The potential of non-fungible tokens (NFT) for game development CHI PLAY ’21, October 18–21, 2021, Virtual Event, Austria
players from countries like China and Mexico with good Internet
access and lower costs of living to play these games full time and
sell the in-game assets (gold or loot) on commercial trading sites
like eBay [26]. While game developers eventually put in place sys-
tems to try to stop these transactions, the practice of collecting and
selling in-game assets (gold farming) continues [7].
Potential use cases for game developers include integrating
unique rewards to players or groups, in-game artworks, or col-
lectible items.
3.3 Consumer-created Content
Since the introduction of game engines like id Software’s Doom
Editor Utility in 1993 [21, 29], players have been created or modified
(mod) video games. Modifications (mods) like Half-Life and mods
of mods like Counter-Strike have seen considerable commercial
success [29]. While Half-Life was a commercial enterprise, mods
created by the user community for fun (see Team Fortress, for
example) have also experienced considerable success [30].While the
developers of the first version of Team Fortress (what is now known
as Team Fortress Classic) were offered employment at Valve [30],
many other fan-created mods have not done some well. However,
the mods have "helped the creator of the editor by extending the
shelf-life of the game" ([30] quoting Gabe Newall). The developer of
the game editors and game engines have benefited enormously from
allowing fans to create mods. Kline et al. [27] posit that involving
the customer in the production process builds brand loyalty and
"closes the loop" between corporations and consumers. However,
although some consumers have benefited from their labor, so have
the corporations. Many of these consumers create mods for fun or
recognition (fame) and not for commercial rewards. The concept
of volunteer labor that benefits a corporation has been referred to
as playbour [23, 29]. Modders are typically players of a particular
game or genre and buy the game engine to make their own version
or vision of the game. Even if this modded game is not a commercial
success, the companies that develop and sell the game engines still
benefit from the sale of the game engine and the reputation of being
supportive of the modding community [44]. However, the process
of big business benefiting from the free (or lowly paid) labor of fans
is not without its critics. Goggin [23] refers to the process as the
commodification of fan artwork and creativity. In 2018 Takahashi
[51] talked about a Leisure Economy as a "utopia where people can
make a living by getting paid to play games." At the time this may
have raised a few eyebrows (in disbelief), the number of Twitch and
YouTube streamers who are getting paid a respectable income may
provide some guidance of the potential for the games industry. This
Leisure Economy appears to be an oxymoron, should leisure be
commodified? If we look at Social Media platforms like Facebook,
the developer is benefiting from user-created content.
While many game developers claim ownership of player-created
content that uses the developer’s tools or intellectual property,
some developers like Valve share the proceeds from selling user-
created content ([30]). In many cases, the corporation tends to do
much better than the person who created the content. Valve has
a history of benefiting from players creating in-game content [8].
In 2014, Aziz [8] reported that Valve had paid over $10,000,000 to
661 content creators. In only a year, this number had more than
quintupled to $57,000,000 [36]. Given that Valve shares a percentage
of the revenue from the sale of the user-created in-game content,
this appears to be a very good business model for Valve. However,
if we use a tool like Photoshop to create an original image, Adobe
has no rights to any royalties from the sale of this image. How is
this any different from user-created content from a game?
3.4 Blockchain Games
The Ethereum standard has resulted in several game developers
creating games that enable the player to create or enable the cre-
ation (breed) of unique game objects. Some notable examples are
CyrptoKitties [4], Axie Infinity [1], and Alien Worlds [2]1.
3.4.1 CryptoKitties. In the case of Cryptokitties [47], the devel-
oper managed to create considerable revenue and interest in users
creating, breeding, collecting, and selling in-game assets using the
Ethereum blockchain (an NFT) [4]. For the user, this model repre-
sents an opportunity to own the content they created (Figure 1).
The New York Times reported one Cryptokitty selling for $140,000
[34].
Figure 1: Cryptokitties for Sale. [4]
3.4.2 Axie Infinity. Like CryptoKitties, Axie Infinity enables users
to collect, raise, breed, and battle other creatures known as axies
[1]. Pokemon-inspired digital pet universe where players use the
characters in various games. Unlike CryptoKitties, Axie Infinity
also enables players to create game content (land) and sell it. Axie
Infinity also uses the Etherium Blockchain standard [1].
3.4.3 Alien Worlds. At the time of writing, Alien Worlds [2] was
the top-ranked blockchain game with 22.2K users [3]. Alien Worlds
is a user-created world where the player can collect and play with
unique digital items [2]. Unlike CryptoKitties, Alien Worlds does
not currently facilitate the process of breeding game objects.
3.4.4 Yield Guild Games. Another interesting, more recent trend
has been the introduction of games that let players earn NFTs while
playing the game. Games like Yield Guild2 facilitate players earning
NFTs through gameplay. Games like Yield Guild appear to benefit
from and encourage the process of gold mining.

3.4.5 But wait, there’s more. The NFT craze has already dramati-
cally impacted the collectible market, and like other sectors that
join emerging markets, the games industry is not far behind. When
the authors started writing this paper, a few games used NFTs for
collection, acquisition, and trading. By the time this paper was
submitted for publication, the number of games that used NFTs had
more than doubled. A strong upward trend is apparent.
3.5 Proof of Stake in Games
As mentioned above, PoS is an interesting and resource-saving
alternative and can add various use cases to the games industry.
There are three interesting use cases for PoS in gaming: (1) In-game
economies can be supported by PoS currencies. Developers can
even tweak the algorithm to balance staking for players. This is not
only relevant for one game but the same currency could be used by
several games. (2) Transactions fees of other payment methods (for
example, credit cards) can be reduced. (3) Users have full control
and can use the currency to buy new games.
4 THE CHALLENGES WITH NFTS
While NFTs represent considerable opportunities for artists, col-
lectors, game developers, and users, there are some challenges
associated with NFTs that can not be ignored.
4.1 Regulation
One of the main concerns is the lack of regulation or any central
bank oversight [18]. Moreover, unlike traditional currencies reg-
ulated and controlled by central government regulation, control,
and policy, NFTs have no capital value. The market determines the
value of an NFT. As these transactions operate outside of central
government regulation, there is a risk of people using this to laun-
der money or evade regulatory oversight [61]. Moreover, there is a
concern on how NFTs can be taxed [49].
4.2 Power Consumption
One of the major criticisms of the Bitcoin standard was the amount
of power consumption needed for validation [41]. One of the key
features of the Ethereum standard was to reduce the power con-
sumption needs of other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin [41, 56].
While the Ethereum standard did help reduce the amount of power
consumption when compared to Bitcoin [9], the process of verifica-
tion still requires considerable amounts of power [13]. The power
consumption of cryptocurrencies has raised concerns about the im-
pact on global warming [39]. Although the majority of concern has
been focused on Bitcoin, NFT’s also consume considerable power
[19]. The introduction of POS encryption may address some of
these concerns [45].
4.3 Security
Another concern about NFTs is that if the company that issued
the NFT goes out of business, is hacked, or stops hosting the file,
and the buyer will be left with a token that points to a file that
no longer exists. Moreover, if someone hacks or steals the buyer’s
computer where the token is held, they will lose it. The increase
in the number of hackers stealing personal data from corporate or
government databases is of considerable concern [42]. Given the
perceived value of some NFTs, it is only a matter of time before
hackers start trying to infiltrate the servers that host the token.
This could result in hackers holding the token for ransom or selling
it to someone else. As the token is held by the consumer and the
host server, this puts considerable pressure on the security of the
NFT.
4.4 Blockchain Risk
Blockchains, like Ethereum, have proven to be relatively robust.
However, there is some concern that there could be a bug in the
code that breaks down how Ethereum is supposed to function. An
example of the potential for hackers to exploit the vulnerabilities of
the Ethereum blockchain was when Within days of its launch, the
DAO was exploited and drained of nearly 3.7m Ethereum tokens
[18, 37].
4.5 Marginalized Communities
Another potential challenge for NFTs is that as they primarily sup-
port the exchange of digital assets, there is a risk of marginalizing
the arts community whose creative practice is not well suited to a
digital format. Moreover, if the NFT is a digital reproduction of a
physical object, who owns the property rights of the original?
4.6 Ownership & Intellectual Property Rights
The actual owner of consumer-developed digital content is an am-
biguous legal concept. While it has been possible to copyright
computer software, the idea owning a digital property that the
consumer made is fraught with challenges. If a consumer in France
creates a digital asset using software owned by a company in the
USA and the software is hosted in China, which laws would apply?
The laws of France (the residence of the person who made it), the
USA (the country of residence of the software company), or China,
where the software is hosted?.
The other legal challenge is around digital reproductions of phys-
ical objects. An NFT of a digital photo of a physical object provides
a trace of the owner of the digital photo, there is no record of who
owns the copyright of the physical object. Further, the creation
of memes or other community created content, usually involves
a combination of art that belongs to someone. Further, creating
memes or other community-created content usually involves a com-
bination of art that belongs to someone (who hold the Intellectual
Property Rights (IPR)) and text that the user created.
Another legal challenge is around who has the right to copy
the digital work. While developers like Valve provide guidance in
the end user license agreement (EULA) as to the right to copy and
commercial use, there does not appear to be a lot of guidance on
who is the copyright holder for an NFT of digital content. Further,
the consumer has an NFT of a digital asset is held on the server,
what is there to stop the anyone from copying, making a minor
change to the content, and then selling an NFT for the changed
version? Moreover, in games where players breed game objects if
player A’s game object and Player B’s game object create a new
game object, which player owns the intellectual property, and who
would benefit from selling the child game object? If the child game
object then breeds with player C’s game object, who would own
the IPR of the grandchild?

4.7 Currency
At the time of writing, there were multiple Blockchains used for
buying and selling game content (see [3]). While many of these
Blockchains are based on the Ethereum standard, none of them
can be easily exchanged without an intermediary. Moreover, only
a few of them can be exchanged with an intermediary. While this
might be fine for players within a game, it makes it challenging to
exchange ownership of items from different games or gaming plat-
forms. There is no central system for determining the exchange rate
or providing oversight of these transactions, this adds an element
of risk for players wanting to exchange, for example, a CryptoKitty
with an Axie.
Another issue with Blockchain currencies is the lack of standard-
ization. While Ethereum established a standard, other developers
identified some challenges with this standard and developed their
own. As noted, Flow was created to reduce the power consumption
used in the Ethereum blockchain [5]. EOSIO is another blockchain
developed to address the power consumption challenges associated
with the Ethereum blockchain [25]. However, while addressing the
limitations of the Ethereum blockchain, the EOSIO blockchain is
open to more security risks [25]. As creating a blockchain is not
especially challenging, it is highly likely that there will be many
more standards used for NFTs.
4.8 Exchange
With physical money, there is a system of exchanging one cur-
rency for another. However, with Cryptocurrencies, exchanging
one cryptocurrency for another becomes more challenging. While
it is relatively easy to purchase cryptocurrencies, exchanging them
for cash is more challenging.
5 CONCLUSION
In this paper, the authors provided an overview of NFTs. The au-
thors have also provided an overview of some challenges and oppor-
tunities for game developers planning to use NFTs. While there is a
potentially enormous opportunity for developers to leverage NFTs
to enable players and investors to buy and sell in-game content,
there is conversely an enormous risk. While the use of NFTs in
games is still emerging, it will be interesting to see if major cor-
porations and or governments take a position to standardize and
regulate this industry. Until then, it’s a bit like living in the Wild
West.
