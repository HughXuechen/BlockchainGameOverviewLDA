Abstract. The goal of this paper is to introduce a new notion called
“Consensus Game (CG)” with motivation from the mechanism design of
blockchain economy under the consensus incentives from Bitcoin ecosys-
tems in financial technology (Fintech), we then establish the general
existence results for consensus equilibria of consensus games in terms of
corresponding interpretation based on the viewpoint of Blockchain con-
sensus in Fintech by applying the concept of hybrid solutions in game
theory. As applications, our discussion in this paper for the illustration
of some issues and problems on the stability of mining pool-games for
miners by applying consensus games shows that the concept of consensus
equilibria could be used as a fundamental tool for the study of consensus
economics under the framework of Blockchain economy in Fintech.

1 Introduction
In the game theory, Nash equilibrium follows the noncooperatitive idea, while the
core is defined by considering the cooperative behavior of players. They concern
on the noncooperative and cooperative idea respectively. Generally speaking,
a cooperative solution concept (the α–core) was first introduced by Aumann
[5]. Later, Scarf [44] proved an nonemptiness result for the α–core in a normal-
form game with continuous and quasiconcave payoff functions. Inspired by Scarf
[44], Kajii [29] provided a generalization of Scarf [44] to games with nonordered
preferences, and Kajii’s result and proof technique is also a modification and
development of Border [11]. On the other hand, Florenzano [20] provided a new
proof technique to obtain an existence theorem of the core in a coalition produc-
tion economy with nonordered preferences. In [20], Florenzano defined the group
preferences of each coalition and gave the proof by using Gale and Mas-Colell
fixed point theorem. Following the method of [20], Lefebvre [32] provided a gen-
eralization to an economy with different information, and Martins-da-Rocha and
Yannelis [33] extended Kajii’s result to games on Hausdorff topological vector
spaces. For more work on the α–core, we can refer to [1–4,28,38,39,45,48,52–54]
and references wherein.
With motivation from Zhao [57] and Kajii [29], as discussed by Yang and
Yuan [54] recently, our first goal is to establish consensus games without ordered
preferences from the viewpoint of Blockchain in Fintech. In briefly, the consensus
game considers whether there exists an acceptable (may or may not be “opti-
mal”) collaborating strategy which consists of a partial cooperative strategy and
a partial noncooperative strategy under a given consensus rule in which some
participants are based on cooperative, and the other part based on noncooper-
ative game strategies to follow “Mining Longest Chain Rules (LCR)” (see also
the original idea due to Nakamoto [36], the study by Nyumbayire [40], Biais
[9] and reference wherein), while with or without occurring forks for blockchain
acting as a platform (in supporting for different types business activities so-
called digital economy). Thus, comparing with the traditional cooperative and
noncooperative game, the consensus game is a natural extension for consensus
economy, especially under the framework of Bitcoin ecosystem associated with
consensus incentives in Bitcoin ecosystems (in terms of Nakamoto’s consensus
protocol as one example). Moreover, by following the study for the stability of
the blockchain in supporting Bitcoin ecosystems under general consensus (due
to Nakamoto [36]) in terms of mining economics, mining games and pool games
extensively studied by Kroll et al. [31], Eyal and Sirer [19], Eyal [18], Bonneau
et al. [10] (see also Carlsten et al. [12], Kiayias et al. [30], Sapirstein et al. [43],
Biais et al. [9] and references wherein), plus the study on the existence of equilib-
ria for blockchain disruption with or without occurring forks by Biais [9], smart
contracts discussed by Cong and He [15], and move toward blockchain-based
accounting and assurance given by Dai and Vasarhelyi [17], and following the
idea of Zhao [57], it seems that the notion of consensus equilibria for consensus
games with a partition of the set of players through the nonordered preferences
The Consensus Games for Blockchain Economics in Fintech 3
mappings and related forms will be a useful tool for the study of consensus eco-
nomics under the framework of Blockchain as a new kind of data structure in
the practice.
Note that the classical results for the α–core concern on games with finitely
many players. By considering a strong blocking concept, Weber [50] first proved
an nonemptiness result for a core of a nontransferable cooperative game with
infinitely many players. Inspired by Weber [50], Askoura [1] proved the exis-
tence of the weak core for games with a continuum of players. Later, Askoura
[4] improved the result by considering the equi-usc condition of payoffs. More-
over, the work on the weak α–core was studied by Yang [52] and Yang [53].
Recently, Yang and Yuan [54] provided a generalization of Zhao [57] to games
with nonordered preferences and proved the existence of weak hybrid solutions
with infinitely many players.
In brief, we shall introduce a concept called “Consensus Game” (CG) with
motivation from the mechanism design for the blockchain in financial technology
under the consensus incentives introduced by Nakamoto [36] (see also Biais [9],
Cong and He [15], Narayanan et al. [37], Nyumbayire [40] and related references
wherein). Starting from results by Zhao [57] to Yang and Yuan [54] where a
number of existence results have been established for a general game, while our
paper mainly captures the consensus idea of blockchain consensus in Fintech,
and the work of Yang and Yuan [54] plays an important role in modelling the
Blockchain in Fintech, e.g., see Yuan et al. [58] and references wherein.
We like to share with readers that in this paper, we give a outline how the
issue and problems on the stability of pool-games (e.g., the Bitcoin economy)
can be formulated as applications of consensus games by using the concept of
consensus equilibria, which could be used as a fundamental tool for the study of
consensus economics under general framework of Blockchain economy in Fintech.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we recall the model
and results from Zhao [57]. Section 3 recalls the main results from Yang and
Yuan [54]. Section 4 illustrates how our notion of consensus games can be used
easily to study the stability for Bitcoin ecosystems as applications of consensus
games for two-pool games and multi-pools games, and Sect. 5 is the conclusion.
2 The Concept of Hybrid Solution in Game Theory
In this section, we recall some definitions and results from Zhao [57] (see also
Yang and Yuan [54] and recent references wherein). Which were also recalled in
Sect. 2 of [54]. For the sake of completeness for reading, we give their statements
for results on Hybrid solution in game theory.
Let N = {1, · · · , n0} be the set of agents and p = {N1, · · · , Nk0} be a
partition of N , i.e.,
N1
⋃
· · ·
⋃
Nk0 = N, Ni
⋂
Nj = ∅,∀i �= j.
Denote by N the set of all nonempty subsets of N and Nr the set of nonempty
subsets of Nr for each r = 1, · · · , k0.
4 L. Di et al.
A normal-form game with a partition can be defined by
G = (N, p, (Xi, ui)i∈N ),
where Xi is the strategy set of player i, and X =
∏
i∈N Xi, XS =
∏
i∈S Xi,
X−S =
∏
i�∈S Xi,∀S ∈ N ; ui : X −→ R is the utility function of agent i. A
strategy x∗ ∈ X is said to be a hybrid solution of G if for any Nr ∈ p and any
S ∈ Nr, there exists no yS ∈ XS such that
ui(yS , zNr−S , x∗
−Nr
) > ui(x∗
Nr
, x∗
−Nr
), ∀i ∈ S, ∀zNr−S ∈ XNr−S .
The following result is a stronger version of Theorem 2 in Zhao [57] (see also
Theorem 2.1 of Yang and Yuan [54]).
Theorem 2.1. Suppose that a normal-form game with a partition
G = (N, p, (Xi, ui)i∈N )
satisfies the following conditions:
(i) for each i ∈ N , Xi is a nonempty convex compact subset of Rmi ;
(ii) for each i ∈ N , ui is continuous and quasiconcave on X.
Then there exists at least a hybrid solution of G.
Furthermore, Zhao [57] defined a general cooperative game with a partition
G = {Gr(x−Nr
) = (Nr, (XS , uS(·, x−Nr
))S∈Nr
)|r = 1, . . . , k0},
where uS(·, x−Nr
) : XS −→ R|S| is a vector-valued utility function of the coali-
tion S ∈ Nr for any x−Nr
∈ X−Nr
and any r = 1, . . . , k0. A point x∗ ∈ X is
a hybrid solution of G if for any r = 1, . . . , k0 and any S ∈ Nr, there exists no
yS ∈ XS such that
uS(yS , x∗
−Nr
) > (uN (x∗
Nr
, x∗
−Nr
))S .
The following result is Theorem 3 of [57] (see also Theorem 2.2 of Yang and
Yuan [54]).
Theorem 2.2 (Zhao [57]). Suppose that a general cooperative game G with a
partition p satisfies the following conditions:
(i) for any r = 1, · · · , k0 and any x−Nr
∈ X−Nr
, Gr(x−Nr
) is balanced;
(ii) for any i ∈ N , Xi is a nonempty convex compact subset of Rmi ;
(iii) for any Nr ∈ p and any S ∈ Nr, uS is continuous on XS × X−Nr
and
uS(·, x−Nr
) is quasiconcave on XS for any x−Nr
∈ X−Nr
.
Then there exists a hybrid solution of G at least.

3 The Concept of Consensus Games and Related Results
In this section, as applications of hybrid solutions, we shall introduce a new
concept called “Consensus Game” (in short, “CG”), which is used in consen-
sus economics to describe what kind of general consensus (through the real-
ization of mechanism design) will achieve incentive compatibility to fight non-
cooperative behaviors and the coalition of participants (agents) under the plat-
form of Blockchain in financial technology. Then we will discuss the existence
of general consensus games’ equilibria by using the concept of hybrid solutions.
For the related reference on Blockchain and related Nakamoto consensus [36],
please see Kroll et al. [31], Eyal and Sirer [19], Eyal [18], Bonnean et al. [10] (see
also Carlsten et al. [12]), Kiayias et al. [30], Sapirstein et al. [43], Biais et al. [9],
Nyumbayire [40], Narayanan [37] and related references wherein).
In the Fintech, in particular under the Nakamoto consensus protocol intro-
duced in Year 2008, one key issue is to find a set of rules (for consensus) to
encourage agents (miners from mining pools) to follow rules truthfully under
the corresponding (consensus) protocol which may be formulated as preference
mappings for abstract economy model (see Yannelis and Prabhakar [51], Yuan
[55] and references wherein), thus it is very important to study the stability of
Blockchain consensus in terms of equilibria for miners (from ming pools) to fol-
low the so-called “Mining LCR” (also see the discussion in Sect. 4 below) while
with or without occurring of forks for blockchain of Bitcoin ecosystems, the some
other issues needed to be considered are possible collusive equilibria and their
behavior related to smart contracts, or dynamic equilibria under blockchain dis-
ruption as initially discussed by Cong and He [15], and some other issues such
as emerging blockchain-based accounting and assurance outlined by Dai and
Varsarhelyi [17], discussed by Narayanan et al. [37] and so on.
Using the framework of the blockchain and associated consensus mechanism,
the stability for Blockchain can be formulated as the question to find a strategy
for all miners of pools (for Bitcoins) to follow up “LCR behaviors” respect to
either noncooperative or cooperative behaviors (see also the discussion given in
Sect. 4.3), which is exactly the notion for the concept of “hybrid solution” for
games given by Zhao [57]), we thus come to have the following definition for a
Consensus Game (in short, “CG”):
Given a consensus G (by consisting of a number of rules), let N =
{1, 2, · · · , n0} be the set of agents and p = {N1, · · · , Nk0} be a partition of
N (as defined above). For each i ∈ N , the mapping ui : X −→ R is the payoff
function of player i determined by the rules of the consensus G, we say that a
normal form of consensus game (CG) is just the following form:
CG := (G, N, p, (Xi, ui)i∈N )
We say the consensus game CG has a consensus equilibrium if the corre-
sponding formal form of the game (N, p, (Xi, ui)i∈N ) has a bybrid solution.
We note that by using the quorum function, Zappala et al. [56] used the
term (that is, consensus game) to measure agents’ degree of supporting for the
6 L. Di et al.
formulation of that coalition to study decision problem, which is different from
our motivation above.
Throughout the rest part of this paper, when mentioning the consensus game
(CG), we always assume it associated with the consensus G and omit it if no
confusion. We now have the defining consensus equilibria for the consensus games
with nonordered preferences.
A consensus game can be defined by
CG = (N, p, (X(t))t∈N , P ),
where p = {Nr|r ∈ R} is a partition of N , X(t) is the strategy space of player
t, and X =
∏
t∈N X(t),X(S) =
∏
t∈S X(t),X(−S) =
∏
t�∈S X(t),∀S ∈ N ,
P (t, ·) : X ⇒ X is the preference mapping of player t. A point x∗ ∈ X is a
consensus equilibrium of CG if for any Nr ∈ p and any S ∈ Nr, there exists no
y(S) ∈ X(S) such that
{y(S)} × X(Nr − S) × {x∗(−Nr)} ⊂ P (t, x∗), ∀t ∈ S.
We now recall results from Yang and Yuan [54]. The following result is the
consensus game’s version due to Theorem 3.1 of Yang and Yuan [54].
Theorem 3.1 (Yang and Yuan [54]). Suppose that a consensus game
CG = (N, p, (X(t))t∈N , P )
satisfies the following conditions:
(i) N is a finite set;
(ii) for each t ∈ N , X(t) is a nonempty convex compact subset of Rmt ;
(iii) for each t ∈ N , P (t, ·) is convex-valued with open graph in X × X, and
x �∈ P (t, x) for any x ∈ X.
Then there exists at least a consensus equilibrium of CG.
Yang and Yuan [54] next gave an infinite dimensional version of Theorem 3.1,
see Theorem 3.2 of [54]. Here we state it by using concept of consensus games.
Theorem 3.2 (Yang and Yuan [54]). Suppose that a consensus game
CG = (N, p, (X(t))t∈N , P )
satisfies the following conditions:
(i) N is a finite set;
(ii) for each t ∈ N , X(t) is a nonempty convex compact subset of a Hausdorff
topological vector space E(t);
(iii) for each t ∈ N , P (t, ·) is convex-valued with open graph in X × X and
x �∈ P (t, x) for any x ∈ X.
Then there exists at least a consensus equilibrium of CG.
The Consensus Games for Blockchain Economics in Fintech 7
As an application of Theorem3.2, we have the following corollary which is
indeed an extension of Theorem 2.1 into topological vector spaces.
Corollary 3.1 Suppose that a normal-form game with a partition
G = (N, p, (Xi, ui)i∈N )
satisfies the following conditions:
(i) for each i ∈ N , Xi is a nonempty convex compact subset of a Hausdorff
topological vector space Ei;
(ii) for each i ∈ N , ui is continuous and quasiconcave on X.
Then there exists at least a hybrid solution of G (thus the consensus equilib-
rium of consensus game G).
We next recall the result with infinitely many players from Yang and Yuan
[54]. Let N be a topological space. We define the set Ω by
Ω = {(Nr, S)|S ⊆ Nr, Nr ∈ p},
for a consensus game CG = (N, p, (X(t))t∈N , P ).
A member (Nr, S) of Ω consensus-blocks a strategy x ∈ X if there exists
y(S) ∈ X(S) such that
{y(S)} × X(Nr − S) × {x(−Nr)} ⊂ P (t, x), ∀t ∈ S.
A member (Nr, S) of Ω strongly consensus-blocks a strategy x ∈ X if there
exist y(S) ∈ X(S) and an open set V in N × X × X such that
S × {x} × {y(S)} × X(Nr − S) × {x(−Nr)} ⊂ V ⊂ clV ⊂ Graph(P ).
A strategy x∗ ∈ X is a (weak) consensus equilibrium of CG if every member of
Ω cannot (strongly) consensus-block x∗.
The proofs of the following result can be found in Lemmas 3.1–3.3 and The-
orem 3.4 of Yang and Yuan [54], and we state it as an existence result for weak
consensus equilibria of consensus games in a general form.
Theorem 3.3 (Yang and Yuan [54]). Suppose that a consensus game G =
(N, p, (X(t))t∈N , P ) satisfies:
(1) N is a nonempty compact Hausdorff topological space.
(2) For each t ∈ N , X(t) is a nonempty convex compact subset of a Hausdorff
topological vector space E(t).
(3) The correspondence P is convex-valued with open graph in N × X × X and
x �∈ P (t, x) for all (t, x) ∈ N × X.
Then there exists at least a weak consensus equilibrium.
8 L. Di et al.
In this section, the consensus games’ results are mainly based on the existence
results of theoretical models in game theory first established by Yang and Yuan
[54], we omit their proof in details by saving spaces here (for proof details, we
refer to Yang and Yuan [54]).
Next as applications, we will discuss the general stability problems of mining
pool-games for miners under the framework of Blockchain consensus for Bitcoin
economics through the illustration of the general mining pool games related
miners for Bitcoins as examples to show that the concept of consensus equilibria
could be used as a fundamental tool for the study of consensus economics in
Fintech.
4 The Consensus Games for Bitcoin Ecosystems
In this section, we first discuss the general stability problems related study from
a number of literatures for mining pool-games of miners for Bitcoins consensus
principle (due to Nakamoto introduced in year 2008) under the framework of
Blockchain consensus for Bitcoin economics. Then as applications of the exis-
tence of consensus equilibria (mainly Corollary 3.1) as an example, we will see
how general mining pool games related miners for Bitcoins can be easily illus-
trated by the concept of consensus equilibria, which could be used as a funda-
mental tool for the study of consensus economics in Fintech.
Bitcoin is by far the most successful decentralized digital currency after the
presentation of white paper by Nakamoto [36]. Its backbone is the blockchain
protocol which attempts to keep a consisted list of transactions in a peer-to-peer
network. The goal of blockchain protocol is to solve the real distributed prob-
lem of agreement, and has the potential to support innovation and applications
which require distributed computing across a network, and proving new forms
of assets such as “Digital Assets” and others associated business activities with
the “Blockchain” (a kind of new data structure) which can also be interpreted
acting as a “platform” in supporting digital assets’ trading, financing, and many
other kinds of business activities. All of these new forms of digital business,
digital services with the complex relationship that exists between them under
the environment of Bitcoin and blockchain are called “Bitcoin Ecosystems” in
general.
Bitcoin implements its incentive systems with a data structure called the
Blockchain as mentioned above by following “Blockchain Protocol.” The key
idea of Blockchain Protocol is a serialization of all Bitcoin transactions. It is
a single global ledger maintained by an open distributed system. Since anyone
can join the open system and participate in maintaining the blockchain, Bitcoin
uses a proof of work mechanism to deter attacks: participation requires exerting
significant compute resources. A participant that proves she or he has exerted
enough resources with a proof of work is allowed to take a step in the proto-
col by generating a block. Participants are compensated for their efforts with
newly minted Bitcoins. The process of creating a block is called mining, and the
participants, miners.
The Consensus Games for Blockchain Economics in Fintech 9
In order to win the reward, many miners try to generate blocks. The system
automatically adjusts the difficulty of block generation, such that one block is
added every 10 min to the blockchain. This means that each miner seldom gen-
erates a block. Although its revenue may be positive in expectation, a miner
may have to wait for an extended period to create a block and earn the actual
Bitcoins. Therefore, miners form mining pools, where all members mine concur-
rently and they share their revenue whenever one of them creates a block.
Pools are typically implemented as a pool manager and a cohort of miners.
The pool manager joins the Bitcoin system as a single miner. Instead of gener-
ating proof of work, it outsources the work to the miners. In order to evaluate
the miners efforts, the pool manager accepts partial proof of work and estimates
each miner’s power according to the rate with which it submits such partial proof
of work. When a miner generates a full proof of work, it is sent to the pool man-
ager which publishes this proof of work to the Bitcoin system. The pool manager
thus receives the full revenue of the block and distributes it fairly according to
its members’ power. Many of the pools are open by allowing any miner to join
them using a public Internet interface.
In fact Bitcoin’s blockchain protocol provides two incentives for miners:
“Block rewards” and “ransaction fees,” which are key drivers for Bitcoin ecosys-
tems. The former accounts for the vast majority of miner revenues at the begin-
ning of the system, but it is expected to transition to the latter as the block
rewards dwindle. There has been an implicit belief that whether miners are paid
by block rewards or transaction fees does not affect the security of the block
chain. But Carlsten et al. [12] (see also Kroll et al. [31], Eyal and Sirer [19],
Eyal [18], Bonneau et al. [10] and a number of related references wherein) show
that this is not the case, their key insight is that with only transaction fees, the
variance of the block reward is very high due to the exponentially distributed
block arrival time, and it becomes attractive to fork a “wealthy” block to “steal”
the rewards therein. They show that this results in an equilibrium with undesir-
able properties for Bitcoin’s security and performance, and even non-equilibria
in some circumstances. Moreover, They also study selfish mining and show that
it can be profitable for a miner with an arbitrarily low hash power share, who is
arbitrarily poorly connected within the network, or working by themselves (i.e.,
miners’ behavior in noncooperation game’s way, or saying “noncooperative min-
ing behavior”). Thus we need to consider the stability of Bitcoin ecosystems, in
particular, for the miners’ working behavior and strategy (also called “mining for
Bitcoin”) in different pools for the implementation of the most important parts
due to Nakamoto’s consensus being so-called the “proof of work” mechanism in
Bitcoin economics.
4.1 The Stability of Bitcoin Ecosystems
We know that Bitcoin is the first widely popular cryptocurrency with a broad
user base and a rich ecosystem, all hinging on the incentives in place to maintain
the critical Bitcoin blockchain. For blockchain which acts as a platform (or say-
ing, a new kind of data structures, or a tool) in supporting businesses under the
10 L. Di et al.
Bitcoin ecosystem, a natural process leads participants of such systems to form
pools where members aggregate their power and share the rewards. Experience
with Bitcoin shows that the largest pools are often open, allowing anyone to
join. On the other hand, it has long been known that a member can sabotage
an open pool by joining but never sharing proofs of work. The pool shares its
revenue with the attacker, and each of its participants earns less.
Thus open pools are susceptible to the classical block withholding attack
(e.g., see Rosenfeld [42]), where a miner sends only partial proof of work to the
pool manager and discards full proof of work. Due to the partial proof of work
sent to the pool by the miner, the miner is considered a regular pool member
and the pool can estimate its power. Therefore, the attacker shares the revenue
obtained by the other pool members, but does not contribute. It reduces the
revenue of the other members, but also its own.
By thinking of another case is that a game where pools use some of their
participants to infiltrate other pools and perform such an attack, one of the
special cases is where either two pools or any number of identical pools play
the game and the rest of the participants are uninvolved. In both of these cases,
one natural question to ask is: does there exist an situation (equilibrium) that
constitutes a tragedy of the commons where the participating pools attack one
another and earn less than they would have if none had attacked?
Moreover, by following Bonneau et al. [10], we face two opposing viewpoints
on Bitcoin in strawman form. The first is that “Bitcoin works in practice, but not
in theory.” A second viewpoint is that “Bitcoin’s stability relies on an unknown
combination of socioeconomic factors which is hopelessly intractable to model
with sufficient precision, failing to yield a convincing argument for the system’s
soundness.”
By putting above two opposing viewpoints on Bitcoin together, and incor-
porating Bitcoin’s three main (technical) components: “Transactions (including
scripts),” “Consensus protocol,” and “Communication network” as a whole, we
do think it is critical to study the Stability (with more details below) for Bitcoin
respect to its three main components in terms of complex ecosystem.
As shown from the comprehensive study on the stability discussed by Bon-
neau et al. [10], the “stability of the consensus protocol” should be one of the
most important concepts respect to following five issues (see also Garay et al.
[24], Kroll et al. [31], Miller and LaViola [35] and references wherein):
1 Eventual consensus: At any time, all compliant nodes will agree upon a
prefix of what will become the eventual valid blockchain. We cannot require that
the longest chain at any moment is entirely a prefix of the eventual blockchain,
as blocks may be discarded (become stale) due to temporary forks.
2 Exponential convergence: The probability of a fork of depth n is
O(2−n). This gives users high confidence that a simple “k confirmations” rule
will ensure their transactions are permanently included with high confidence.
3 Liveness: New blocks will continue to be added and valid transactions
with appropriate fees will be included in the blockchain within a reasonable
amount of time.
The Consensus Games for Blockchain Economics in Fintech 11
4 Correctness: All blocks in the longest chain will only include valid trans-
actions.
5 Fairness: On expectation, a miner with a proportion α (the computing
power) of the total computational power will mine a proportion ∝ α of blocks
(assuming they choose valid blocks).
If all of these properties hold we can say that the system is “stable,” but
it isn’t clear that all are necessarily required as asked by Bonneau et al. [10].
However, Nakamoto [36] originally argued that Bitcoin will remain stable as
long as all miners follow their own economic incentives (see also Nakamoto [36]
again), a property called “Incentive Compatibility.” But the concept “Incentive
Compatibility” has never been formally defined in the context of Bitcoin or cryp-
tocurrencies; its prevalence as a term likely stems from its intuitive appeal and
marketing value. We consider “Compliant Miners” whose strategies are the so-
called “default mining longest chain rules” (LCR) (see also discussion by Biais
et al. [9] and related references wherein). In game-theoretic terms, if universal
compliance were shown to be a Nash equilibrium, this would imply incentive
compatibility for Bitcoin as no miner would have any incentive to unilaterally
change strategy. This would imply a notion of (weak) stability if other equilibria
exist and strong stability if universal compliance were the sole equilibrium.
On the other hand non-compliant strategies dominate compliance, we must
ask whether the resulting strategy equilibrium leads to stability for the consensus
protocol, thus there are many issues and problems for which we are facing as
recalled below in three categories based on the existing literatures (e.g., see
mainly from Bonneau et al. [10]):
(1) Stability with bitcoin-denominated utility: We need to ask if simple
majority compliance may not ensure fairness? by an interesting non-compliant
mining strategy which is temporary block withholding as discussed by Bahackm
[8], Eyal and Sirer [19], Garay et al. [24]; if majority compliance is an equilibrium
with perfect information as shown by Kroll et al. [31]; if majority compliance may
imply convergence and consensus as discussed by Miller and LaViola [35] and
Garay et al. [24].
Secondly, one of the most important situations is that with a majority miner,
if stability is not guaranteed: indeed, it is well known that a single non-compliant
miner who controls a majority of computational power could undermine fairness
by collecting all of the mining rewards simply by ignoring blocks found by others
and building their own chain which by assumption would grow to become the
longest chain. The majority miner could separately choose to undermine liveness
by arbitrarily censoring transactions by refusing to include them and forking if
they appear in any other block. Finally, the majority miner could undermine
both convergence and eventual consensus by introducing arbitrarily long forks
in the block chain, potentially to reverse and double-spend transactions for profit.
All of these strategies would result in nominal profits, but since these behaviors
are detectable, they may not be in a rational miner’s long-term interest.
We like to mention that for the stability in terms of issue “if mining longest
chain rules” (LCR) was also discussed by Biais et al. [9] through the Markov
12 L. Di et al.
chain method under the situation with, or without mining a fork at the same
time (i.e., the weak stability). Thus it is very important to discuss if it is possible
among miners (in terms of either coordination (cooperation) or noncooperation
behavior) for Bitcoin blockchain on mining LCR (while, with, or without occur-
ring forking) as indeed a fork can also occur even when some miners adopt a
new version of the mining software that is incompatible with the current version
(if miners fail to coordinate on the same software, this triggers a fork).
Furthermore, in line with Nakamoto [36], it is said that the Bitcoin blockchain
protocols are prone to multiple equilibria with forks due to the strategic com-
plementarities of miner’s actions, is it true? We would ask, is the stability there
if miners collude?, and the question, is stability there if mining rewards decline?
(2) Stability with externally-denominated utility: Results in the bitcoin-
denominated utility model do not provide convincing justification of Bitcoin’s
observed stability in practice as we may face the issues such as (a) Liquidity
limits: Currently, exchanges which trade Bitcoin for external currencies typically
have low liquidity. Thus, an attacker may obtain a large number of bitcoins
but be unable to convert them all into external value, or can only do so at a
greatly reduced exchange rate; (b) Exchange rates in the face of attack:
Some non-compliant strategies, particularly those that would affect stability in
a visible way, might undermine public confidence and hence weaken demand
for bitcoins in the short run; (c) Long-term stake in bitcoin-denominated
mining rewards: Most large miners have an additional interest in maintaining
Bitcoin’s exchange rate over time because they have significant capital tied up in
non-liquid mining hard ware which will lose value if the exchange rate declines. If
miners expect they will maintain their share of mining power far into the future
with low marginal costs, then they may avoid strategies which earn them more
bitcoins but decrease the expected value of their future mining rewards.
(3) Stability with incentives other than mining income: At least two
strategies have been analyzed which may be advantageous for a miner whose
utility is not purely derived from mining rewards, they are Goldfinger attacks
(see also Kroll et al. [31]); Feather-forking proposed by Miller [34].
One of the key issues for the miners in the ming pool needs to consider is what
could go wrong for the situation called “Mining Gap” which means if without a
block reward immediately after a block is found if there is zero expected reward
for mining but nonzero electricity cost, then it would be unprofitable for any
miner to mine?
Indeed as discussed by Carlsteb et al. [12], we know that effects of a mining
gap lead to miners mining for a smaller and smaller fraction of the time between
the arrival of blocks (with the difficulty dropping to compensate). Clearly, this
would have a negative impact for Bitcoin security, as the effective hash power
in the network would drop, and it would become easier for a malicious miner to
fork. Of course, turning a rig on and off every ten minutes may be practically
infeasible. Nevertheless, this analysis illustrates that strategic miners might look
for ways to deviate when the default protocol would have them wasting electricity
to mine a near-valueless block.
The Consensus Games for Blockchain Economics in Fintech 13
The goal of this part is to establish an outline of the question on the stability
of Bitcoin system on Blockchain can be formulated as the existence problem of
consensus equilibria under the framework of consensus games with focus on the
consensus associated with Bitcoin ecosystem, we give a brief recalling for the
description of basic mining economics by following “three types of consen-
suses” below.
4.2 The Basic Mining Economics
Success of the Bitcoin economy requires that Bitcoin’s distributed protocols oper-
ate and remain stable. In this section we consider the stability of these protocols,
under the assumption that players behave according to their incentives. The suc-
cess of Bitcoin relies on “three types of consensuses”:
1 Consensus about Rules: Players must agree on criteria to determine
which transactions are valid. Only valid transactions will be memorialized in the
Bitcoin log, but this requires agreement on how to determine validity.
2 Consensus about State: Players must agree on which transactions have
actually occurred, that is, they must agree on the history of the Bitcoin economy,
so that there is a common understanding of who owns which coin at any given
time.
3 Consensus that Bitcoins are Valuable: Players must agree that Bit-
coins have value so that players will be willing to accept Bitcoins in payment.
Each of these forms of consensus depends mutually on the other two. For
example, it is hard to agree on the history without agreeing on the rules, and it
is hard to believe in the value of a Bitcoin if participants cannot even agree on
who owns which Bitcoin.
Consensus about the rules is a social process. Participants must come to a
common understanding of what is allowed, so that the rules can be encoded into
the software that each participant uses. In Bitcoin, small groups and individuals
can exert outsized power.
Consensus about state is a technological problem in distributed systems
design. Each player can see part of the state and the players need to coop-
erate, in large numbers and across a potentially unreliable network, to achieve
a consistent understanding of the global state. Technological consensus must be
achieved despite the possibility that some players will deviate from the published
rules. In the distributed systems literature, devious behavior (“Byzantine fail-
ures”) can often be tolerated if a sufficient majority of players are honest and
cooperate. However, in Bitcoin, we explicitly assume that players will behave
according to their incentives (assuming cooperation despite incentives to the
contrary would make the design much simpler, though unrealistic.)
Game-theoretic issues are very important for the correct execution of
the blockchain protocol. This was realized at its inception when its creator,
Nakamoto [36] analyzed incentives in a simple, albeit insufficient, model. Under-
standing these issues is essential for the survival of bitcoin and the development
of the blockchain protocol. In practice it can help understand their strengths
14 L. Di et al.
and vulnerabilities and, in economic and algorithmic theory, it can provide an
excellent example for studying how rational (“selfish miners”) players can play
games in a distributed way and map out their possibilities and difficulties.
Distilling the essential game-theoretic properties of blockchain maintenance is
far from trivial; some “attacks” and vulnerabilities have been proposed but there
seems to exist no systematic way to discover them. In this work, we will study
two models’ stutaions of mining pool-games as applications of our consensus
games below in which the miners (the nodes of the distributed network that
run the protocol and are paid for it) play a complete-information (may or may
not be “stochastic”) games. Although the miners in the actual blockchain game
do not have complete information, our games aim to capture two important
questions that selfish miners ask (see also Kiayias et al. [30], Carlsten et al. [12],
Badertscher etal. [7] and related references wherein):
(a) What to compute next (more precisely, which block to mine);
(b) When to release the results of computation (more precisely, when to release
a mined block).
Ideally, the blockchain would be a simple chain of blocks implying precedence
between the corresponding transactions, i.e., a serialization of valid transactions
between the clients of the Bitcoin protocol. This would be the case if miners
always started mining at the last announced block and propagated each block
creation immediately to the network of the remaining miners. However, the self-
ish nature of the miners who try to receive the rewards of as many blocks as
possible (or even the inherent delay of block propagation in the distributed net-
work) can result in temporary forks in the blockchain. The protocol suggests
to the miners to always start mining at the end of the branch which needed
the largest amount of computational effort so far, i.e., the end of the longest
fork. This strategy is called “frontier” and we will call the miners that follow it
“honest miners.”
The reward structure of the protocol guarantees that the honest miners rev-
enue is proportional to their computational power. However, understanding when
it is profitable for the miners to deviate from the honest strategy is a central
question and has attracted a lot of attention. The original assumption was that
no miner has an incentive to deviate from the honest strategy if the majority
of the miners are honest. However, this is not true as shown by Eyal and Sirer
[19]. They gave a specific strategy which, when followed by a miner with compu-
tational power at least 33% of the total power, provides rewards strictly better
than the honest strategy (assuming that every other miner is honest). This was
extended computationally by Sapirstein et al. [43].
Bitcoin is the first widely popular cryptocurrency with a broad user base
and a rich ecosystem, all hinging on the incentives in place to maintain the
critical Bitcoin blockchain. But Eyal and Sirer [19] show that Bitcoin’s mining
protocol is not “incentive-compatible”: which means there exist a “selfish-miner”,
a mining strategy that enables pools of colluding miners that adopt it to earn
revenues in excess of their mining power. As a result, higher revenues can lead
new miners to join a selfish miner pool, a dangerous dynamic that enables the
The Consensus Games for Blockchain Economics in Fintech 15
selfish mining pool to grow towards a majority. The Bitcoin system would be
much more robust if it were to adopt an automated mechanism that can thwart
selfish miners. Eyal and Sirer [19] suggest a backwards-compatible modification
to Bitcoin that ensures that pools smaller than 1
4 of the total mining power
cannot profitably engage selfish mining, and they also show that at least 2
3 of
the network needs to be honest to thwart selfish mining, which concludes that
“a simple majority is not enough”, thus we need to study in which way the
existence of equilibria for mining economics in “Mining LCR”, while, with or
without occurring “mining fork” from miners of the mining-pools.
4.3 The Stability of Mining Pool Games Under the Framework
by Concepts of Consensus Games
Recently, there are a number of informal and/or ad hoc attempts to address
the security of Bitcoin, an exciting recent line of work has focused on devis-
ing a rigorous cryptographic analysis of the system [e.g., see Garay et al. [23],
Garay et al. [26], Pass et al. [41], Badertscher et al. [6]). At a high level, these
works start by describing an appropriate model of execution, and, within it, an
abstraction of the original Bitcoin protocol of Nakamoto (2008) along with a
specification of its security goals in terms of a set of intuitive desirable proper-
ties (see Garay [25], Garay [26], Pass [41]), or in terms of a functionality in a
simulation-based composable framework (see Badertscher [6]). They then prove
that the Bitcoin protocol meets the proposed specification under the assump-
tion that the majority of the computing power invested in mining bitcoins is by
devices which mine according to the Bitcoin protocol, i.e., honestly. This assump-
tion of honest majority of computing power which had been a folklore within
the Bitcoin community for years underlying the system’s security is captured by
considering the parties who are not mining honestly as controlled by a central
adversary who coordinates them trying to disrupt the protocol’s outcome.
Meanwhile, a number of works have focused on a rational analysis of the
system (see Rosenfeld [42], Carlsten [12], Eyal and Sirer [19] and references
wherein). In a nutshell, these works treat Bitcoin as a game between the (com-
peting) rational miners, trying to maximize a set of utilities that are postulated
as a natural incentive structure for the system. The goal of such an analysis
is to investigate whether or not, or under which assumptions on the incentives
and/or the level of collaboration of the parties, Bitcoin achieves a stable state,
i.e., a game-theoretic equilibrium. However, despite several enlightening conclu-
sions, more often than not the prediction of such analyses is rather pessimistic.
Indeed, these results typically conclude that, unless assumptions on the amount
of honest computing powersometimes even stronger than just majority-are made,
the induced incentives result in plausibility of an attack to the Bitcoin mining
protocol, which yields undesired outcomes such as forks on the blockchain, or a
considerable slowdown.
To our knowledge, no fork or substantial slowdown that is attributed to ratio-
nal attacks has been observed to date, and the Bitcoin network keeps performing
according to its specification, even though mining pools would, in principle, be
16 L. Di et al.
able to launch collaborative attacks given the power they control. In the game-
theoretic setting, this mismatch between the predicted and observed behavior
would be typically interpreted as an indication that the underlying assumptions
about the utility of miners in existing analysis do not accurately capture the min-
ers rationale. With motivation of Badertscher et al. [7], we concern the following
two situations with focus on the so-called “Consensus Economics” (which means
the ecosystems based on the framework of Bitcoin consensuses in general):
Q1 Is Bitcoin possibly broken under different kinds of attacks (or, saying differ-
ently, why does Bitcoin ecosystem work and why do majorities not collude
to break it)?
Q2 Why do honest miners keep mining given the plausibility of such attacks?
Indeed we may interpret the “attackers” as miners playing noncooperative
games by taking different kinds of attack strategies, and “honest miners” playing
cooperative games by following the “default compliant mining rule” of Bitcoin
consensus. By putting Q1 and Q2 together, the existence of the Bitcoin ecosys-
tem is equivalent to the existence of (hybrid) equilibrium which is the so-called
“consensus equilibrium” of the “consensus game” defined above in this paper.
Therefore the existence of consensus equilibrium for consensus games under
the general framework of Bitcoin consensus means there always exists a group
of people working on the “Longest Chain Rule” (LCR) which assures the
Blockchain under the Bitcoin consensus is properly maintained (though some
miners working on forks, other miners do not, e.g., see also Biais et al. [9] from a
different way to address the issue in terms of Markov perfect equilibrium). Thus
the study for the existence of consensus equilibrium for consensus games provide
the fundamental base for consensus economics in general. In this way, we can
study the stability of mining games for Bitcoin as applications of the general
existence results established for consensus games above in this paper as shown
below.
4.4 The Miner’s Dilemma and General Pool Game
By using the concept of consensus games established in this paper, we will discuss
Miner’s Dilemma for Two Pools Game and the general existence of stability for
Multi-Pools Games which was first discussed by Eyal [18] in a different way.
As applications of our new concept called “Consensus Games”, we wish our
discussion for the illustration of “Miner’s Dilemma and General Pool Game”
on the stability of mining pool-games for miners by applying consensus games
provide an example that the concept of consensus equilibria could be used as
a fundamental tool for the study of consensus economics under the framework
of Blockchain economy in Fintech, e.g., see Yuan et al. [50] for the work on
the existence of conesnsus equilibria for data trading under the framework of
Internet of Things (IoT) with Blockchain Ecosystems as applications of our new
notion of Consensus Games.
The Consensus Games for Blockchain Economics in Fintech 17
An open distributed system can be secured by requiring participants to
present proof of work and rewarding them for participation. The Bitcoin dig-
ital currency introduced this mechanism, which has been adopted by almost
all contemporary digital currencies and related services. A natural process leads
participants of such systems to form pools, where members aggregate their power
and share the rewards. Experience with Bitcoin shows that the largest pools are
often open, allowing anyone to join. It has long been known that a member can
sabotage an open pool by seemingly joining it but never sharing proofs of work.
The pool shares its revenue with the attacker, and so each of its participants
earns less.
As discussed by Eyal [18], we define and analyze a game where pools use
some of their participants to infiltrate other pools and perform such an attack.
With any number of pools, no-pool-attacks is not a Nash equilibrium. We study
the special cases where either two pools or any number of identical pools play
the game and the rest of the participants are uninvolved. In both of these cases
there exists an equilibrium that constitutes a tragedy of the commons where the
participating pools attack one another and earn less than they would have if
none had attacked.
For a two-pools game, the decision whether or not to attack is called the
“Miner’s Dilemma”, an instance of the iterative prisoner’s dilemma. The game
is played daily by the active Bitcoin pools, which apparently choose not to attack.
If this balance breaks, the revenue of open pools might diminish, making them
unattractive to participants.
The General Model
By following Eyal [18], we assume the Bitcoin system is comprised of the
Bitcoin network and nodes with unique IDs, and progresses in steps. A node i
generates tasks which are associated with its ID i. Denote the number of pools
with p, the total number of mining power in the system with m and the miners
participating in pool i, where 1 ≤ i, j ≤ p with mi, and m = ∪p
i=1mi, and
mi ∩ mj = ∅ for each i �= j.
A node can work on a task for the duration of a step. The result of this work
is a set of partial proofs of work and a set of full proofs of work. The number of
proofs in each set has a Poisson distribution, partial proofs with a large mean
and full proofs with a small mean. Nodes that work on tasks are called a miners,
miners have identical power, and hence identical probabilities to generate proofs
of work.
The Bitcoin network pays for full proofs of work. To acquire this payoff an
entity publishes a task and its corresponding proof of work to the network.
The payoff goes to the ID associated with task. The Bitcoin protocol normalizes
revenue such that the average total revenue distributed in each step is a constant
throughout the execution of the system. Any node can transact Bitcoins to
another node by issuing a Bitcoin transaction. Nodes that generate tasks but
outsource the work are called pools. Pools send tasks to miners over the network,
the miners receive the tasks, perform the work, and send the partial and full
proofs of work to the pool.
18 L. Di et al.
We follow the same assumption used by Eyal [18], apart from working on
tasks, we assume that all local operations, payments, message sending, propa-
gation, and receipt are instantaneous, and we also assume that the number of
miners is large enough such that mining power can be split arbitrarily without
resolution constraints. We now recall two definitions as follows.
Definition 1 (A solo miner). A solo miner is a node that generates its own
tasks. In every step it generates a task, works on it for the duration of the step
and if it finds a full proof of work, it publishes this proof of work to earn the
payoff.
Definition 2 (Revenue density). The revenue density of a pool is the ratio
between the average revenue a pool member earns and the average revenue it
would have earned as a solo miner.
We note that for a solo miner, its revenue density, and that of a miner working
with an unattacked pool are one. If a pool is attacked with block withholding,
its revenue density decreases.
The Pool Block Withholding Attack
Just as a miner can perform block withholding on a pool j, a pool i can use
some of its mining power to infiltrate a pool j and perform a block withholding
attack on j. Denote the amount of such infiltrating mining power at step t by
xi,j(t). Miners working for pool i, either mining honestly or used for infiltrating
pool j, are loyal to pool i. At the end of a round, pool i aggregates its revenue
from mining in the current round and from its infiltration in the previous round.
It distributes the revenue evenly among all its loyal miners according to their
partial proofs of work. The pool’s miners are oblivious to their role and they
operate as regular honest miners, working on tasks.
The Pool Game
In the pool game, pools try to optimize their infiltration rates of other pools
to maximize their revenue. The overall number of miners and the number of
miners loyal to each pool remain constant throughout the game.
The Revenue Density Analysis of the Pool Game
Recall that mi is the number of miners loyal to pool i. and xi,j(t) is the
number of miners used by pool i to infiltrate pool j at step t. The mining rate
of pool i is therefore the number of its loyal miners minus the miners it uses
for infiltration. This effective mining rate is divided by the total mining rate
in the system, namely the number of all miners that do not engage in block
withholding. Denote the direct mining rate Ri of pool i at step t by
Ri =
mi − Σp
j=1xi,j
m − Σp
j=1Σ
p
k=1xj,k
.
The revenue density ri(t) of pool i at the end of step t is its revenue from
direct mining together with its revenue from infiltrated pools, divided by the
The Consensus Games for Blockchain Economics in Fintech 19
number of its loyal miners together with block-withholding infiltrators that
attack it:
ri(t) =
Ri(t) + Σp
j=1xi,j(t)rj(t)
mi + Σp
j=1xj,i(t)
.
Hereinafter we move to a static state analysis and omit the t argument in
the expressions.
It is clear that if no pool engages in block withholding, for any i ∈ mi and
j ∈ mj , we have
xi,j = 0 and we also have that ri =
1
m
that is, each miner’s revenue is proportional to its power, be it in a pool or
working solo.
The Case for One Attacker
Now by considering a simplified game of two pools, 1 and 2, where pool 1
can infiltrate pool 2, but pool 2 cannot infiltrates pool 1. The m − m1 = m2
miners outside both pools mine solo (or with closed pools that do not attack
and cannot be attacked). The dashed red arrow indicates that x1,2 of pool 1s
mining power infiltrates pool 2 with a block withholding attack.
Since Pool 2 does not engage in block withholding, all of its m2 loyal min-
ers work on its behalf. Pool 1, on the other hand does not employ x1,2 of its
loyal miners, and its direct mining power is only m1 − x1,2 The Bitcoin system
normalizes these rates by the total number of miners that publish full proofs,
namely all miners but x1,2. The pools direct revenues are therefore
R1 =
m1 − x1,2
m − x1,2
R2 =
m2
m − x1,2
.
The revenue density r2 of pool 2 is
r2 =
R2
m2 + x1,2
and the revenue r1 of loyal Pool 1 miner is
r1 =
R1 + x1,2r2
m1
thus we have that
r1 =
m1(m2 + x1,2) − x2
1,2
m1(m − x1,2)(m2 + x1,2)
.
The Case for Two Pools Game
We proceed to analyze the case where two pools may attack each other and
the other miners mine solo. Again we have pool 1 of size m1 and pool 2 of
20 L. Di et al.
size m2; pool 1 controls its infiltration rate x1,2 of pool 2, but now pool 2 also
controls its infiltration rate x2,1 of pool 1. Thus total mining power in the system
is m − x1,2 − x2,1. The direct revenues R1 and R2 of the pools from mining are
their effective mining rates, without infiltrating mining power, divided by the
total mining rate:
R1 =
m1 − x1,2
m − x1,2 − x2,1
R2 =
m1 − x2,1
m − x1,2 − x2,1
.
Then we have the revenues r1 and r2 in terms of x1,2 and x2,1 by the following
formula:
r1(x1,2, x2,1) =
m2R1 + x1,2(R1 + R2)
m1m2 + m1x1,2 + m2x2,1
r2(x2,1, x1,2) =
m1R2 + x2,1(R1 + R2)
m1m2 + m1x1,2 + m2x2,1
.
Now we have the following general existence result for Two-Pools games as an
application of Theorem 3.1 by applying consensus games, this result was first
given by Eyal [18].
Theorem 4.1 (Eyal [18]). For a two-pools game, an equilibrium exists where
neither pool 1 nor pool 2 can improve its revenue by changing its infiltration
rate.
Proof. For i = 1, 2, by the definition of ri, we can verify that it is concave respect
to x1,2 and x2,1. Then by Corollary 3.1, it follows that there exists a consensus
equilibrium point for Two Pools game. The proof is complete.
For the Two Pools game, we remak that like what said by Eyal [18], no-attack
is not an equilibrium point for the Two Pools game as each pool can increase
its revenue by choosing a strictly positive infiltration rate. Thus x1,2 = x2,1 = 0
is not a solution for a Two Pools game. Secondly, it is easy to see that a pool
improves its revenue compared to the no-pool-attacks scenario only when it
controls a strict majority of the total mining power. This fact is also confirmed
by the numerical results given by Eyal [18], and the corresponding numerical
results show that in extreme cases a pool does not attack its counterpart, which
means at equilibrium a pool will refrain from attacking only if the other pool is
larger than about 80% of the total mining power.
As a consequence of Theorem 4.1, we have the following result called “Miner’s
Dilemma of Two Pools Game” (see also discussion by Eyal [18]).
Theorem 4.2 (Miner’s Dilemma of Two Pools Game). For Two Pools game,
it exists “Miner’s Dilemma” which means the revenue density of each pool is
determined by the decision of both pools whether to attack or not. The dominant
strategy of each player is to attack, however the payoff of both would be larger if
they both refrain from attacking.
The Consensus Games for Blockchain Economics in Fintech 21
Proof. Indeed by the fact that for the Two Pools game and i = 1, 2, when x1,2 =
x2,1 = 0, the revenue densities are r1 = r2 = 1, but this is not an equilibrium
point as shown by Theorem 4.1 (or by a simply fact that each pool can increase its
revenue ri by choosing a strictly positive infiltration rate x1,2 or x2,1).
By following the same argument by Eyal [18], without loss of generality by
considering pool 1, as we know that if pool 2 does not attack, pool 1 can increase
its revenue above 1 (i.e., r1 > 1) by attacking. If pool 2 does attack but pool 1
does not, we denote the revenue of pool 1 by r̂1. The exact value of r̂1 depends
on the values of m1 and m2, but it is always smaller than one. As we have seen
above, if pool 1 does choose to attack, its revenue increases, but does not surpass
one. This completes our claim.
Miner’s Dilemma for two pools tell us that the revenue density of each pool is
determined by the decision of both pools whether to attack or not. The dominant
strategy of each player is to attack, however the payoff of both would be larger
if they both refrain from attacking. We also have that in a Two Pools (scenario)
game, the revenue at the symmetric equilibrium is inferior to the no-one-attacks
non-equilibrium strategy.
Next we can establish the general existence in terms of consensus games
for the general case of multi-pools games (which was called “q Indentical Pool
Games” by Eyal [18]).
The General Multi-Pools Games
Let there be q pools of (identical) size mi (for i.j = 1, 2, · · · q, m = ∪q
i=1mi)
(and mi ∩ mj = ∅ for each i �= j) that engage in block withholding strategies
against one another. Other miners neither attack nor are being attacked, this is
the general multi-pools game.
For a general multi-pools game, we would expect that there exists a symmet-
ric equilibrium. Now by considering without loss of generality, a step of pool 1.
It controls its attack rates each of the other pools, and due to symmetry they
are all the same. We denote by x1,−1, the attack rate of pool 1 against any other
pool. Each of the other pools can attack its peers as well. Due to symmetry, all
attack rates by all attackers are identical. Denote by x−1,∗ the attack rate of any
pool other than 1 against any other pool, including pool 1.
We denote by R1 the direct revenue (from mining) of pool 1 and by R−1 the
direct revenue of each of the other pools. Similarly we denote by r1 and r−1 the
revenue densities of pool 1 and other pools, respectively. Then by following the
similar ide used abovem we have the following
R1 =
mi − (q − 1)x1,−1
m − (q − 1)(q − 1)x−1,∗ − (q − 1)x1,−1
R−1 =
mi − (q − 1)x−1,∗
m − (q − 1)(q − 1)x−1,∗ − (q − 1)x1,−1
and
r1 =
R1 + (q − 1)x1,−1r−1
mi + (q − 1)x−1,1
22 L. Di et al.
r−1 =
R−1 + (q − 2)x−1,∗r−1 + x−1,∗r1
mi + (q − 2)x−1,∗ + x1,−1
.
We note that in the symmetric case for general multi-pool game, it follows that
r1 = r−1, and indeed like the two-pool game scenario, the revenue at the sym-
metric equilibrium is inferior to the no-one-attacks non-equilibrium strategy.
Now we have the following general existence consensus games for multi-pools
games below.
Theorem 4.3. (General Multi-Pools Games). For a given general multi-pools
game, its consensus equilibrium always exists.
Proof. For a given multi-pools games (assuming q pools with total number (of
miners) being m = ∪q
i=1mi, and mi ∩ mj = ∅ for each i �= j, while i, j =
1, 2, · · · , q), then by the definition of ri and its formula above, it follows that
ri is continuous (differentiable) and concave in x1,−1. Thus by an application of
Corollary 3.1, it follows that exists at least one consensus equilibrium for the
general multi-pools games. This completes the proof.
Before we close this part, what we like to share with readers is that the con-
cept of consensus games introduced in this paper is very useful for the study
of Bitcoin ecosystem for its stability in terms of the existence for the consensus
equilibria. By the fact that the success of the Bitcoin economy requires that
Bitcoins distributed protocols operate and remain stable under the stability of
these protocols associated with behaviors of players (miners) through pools rely-
ing on the incentives derived by the consensuses in general, thus we do think
the theory of consensus games should provide the base for consensus Economics
under the framework of the Blockchain ecosystems in Fintech (in particular for
Bitcoin economics).
Finally, we like to mention that the stability of gap games formulated by
Tsabary and Eyal [47] can also be studied under the framework of our consensus
games in a natural way by using the partition of miners from different mining
pools, and we plan to conduct this research in our next project soon.
5 The Concluding Remarks
Inspired by the hybrid solution concept of Zhao [57] and the mechanism design
for the blockchain in financial technology, we introduce the model of the consen-
sus game. Although Zappala et al. [56] used the term “consensus game” for the
study of multiagent systems on autonomous agents, which is different from the
outlined model and related concepts we introduced and discussed here in this
paper. The key point of our model is to analyze the choice of strategies in which
there exist cooperative and noncooperative behaviors at the same time and the
preference of each agent is nonordered. Finally, we shall end this paper with the
following remarks.
Our consensus game and consensus equilibrium can be regarded as an appli-
cation of hybrid solutions introduced by Zhao [57]. The main model and result of
The Consensus Games for Blockchain Economics in Fintech 23
consensus games have been given by Yang and Yuan [54]. In [54], the consensus
equilibrium was called by hybrid solution since the viewpoint of [54] bases the
game theory and the purpose of [54] is to study the existence of hybrid solutions
with nonordered preferences and infinitely many players. In this paper, our pur-
pose is to analyze the consensus economy under the framework of blockchain in
Fintech. The result of Yang and Yuan [54] becomes a good technique to model
the framework of blockchain in Fintech. Thus, in Sect. 3, we recall the work of
[54] and call the concepts of [54] by consensus games and consensus equilibria.
Finally, we conclude that the existence results of consensus equilibria for con-
sensus games defined in this paper are useful and should provide the base for
the study of consensus economics under the framework of Blockchain in fintech
as shown by the discussion above. Furthering the study on different situations
related to smart contracts for different kinds of digital business activities under
the Blackchain with associated consensus’ incentives (called “blackchain econ-
omy”) should be one of the most important things in era of big data. We also
note that recently some issue and problems related to topics in fintech have
been studied by a number of scholars, for example, the dynamic equilibria under
blockchain disruption was initially discussed by Cong and He [15], topics sur-
rounding blockchain-based accounting and assurance was outlined by Dai and
Varsarhelyi [17], and other related areas of interest issues were discussed by
Narayanan et al. [37]. Moreover a number of issues and problems in Finteh have
been recently addressed by Goldstein et al. [27], Chiu and Koeppl [14]. Foley
et al. [21], Fuster et al. [22], Tang [46], Vallée and Zeng [49], D’Acunto et al.
[16], Zhu [59], Chen et al. [13] and references wherein. By using the new con-
sensus games, Yuan et al. [50] recently conducted some work on the existence of
consensus equilibria for data trading under the framework of Internet of Things
(IoT) with Blockchain Ecosystems.
Finally, our thinks also go to Miss Susan Bin for her editing service which
led to the present version of the paper.
