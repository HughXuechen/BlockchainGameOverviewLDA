Fairness by Design: The Fair Game and the Fair Price on a Blockchain-Based Marketplace
Fairness by Design: The Fair Game
and the Fair Price on a Blockchain-Based
Marketplace
Alesha Serada
Abstract It is often believed that blockchain technologies can ensure fairness in
online transactions and interactions. What does ‘fair game’ mean in a blockchain-
based game, which rules cannot be broken by design, and how does this relate to
the concept of a ‘fair price’? In this chapter, I use the example of the best known
blockchain-based game CryptoKitties (2017) to explore the idea of a ‘fair price’ both
in theory and in practice, and to connect it to the concept of fairness in games. I turn
to the essential works on fairness and cheating in game studies and check whether
game ethics is applicable to so-called ‘money games’ on blockchain. Theoretically,
decentralization of blockchain technology supports the idea of fairness; however, in
practice, the game follows the same grey moral code as the preceding online games
and virtual worlds. I suggest that the applicable understanding of fairness can be
found in the ‘code is law’ principle that underlines both normative game studies and
the ideology of blockchain.

1 Introduction. Why CryptoKitties?
CryptoKitties [46] is one of the longest-running games that utilize blockchain tech-
nology. Initially, the game was built on the first version of the Ethereum platform
[4], although it exists in a transitional state between different blockchains since
the Ethereum network was clogged in 2020 [20]. According to the original game
design, its players could trade game tokens—‘kitties’—for the cryptocurrency Ether,
and then exchange it for other cryptocurrencies, real world money and goods [10].
Unsurprisingly, the possibility to cash out earnings afforded ethically questionable
behaviour such as speculation [26], in the form of seeking “the maximum benefits

frommarket fluctuations” [26], while, potentially, manipulating the prices [43], often
at the expense of less experienced participants. The game itself, however, attracted
its share of devoted players; to distinguish between economic and playful activities
in the game, Lee et al. suggest separating item-selling, which is most often driven by
speculative motives, from item purchasing, gifting, and breeding, which constitute
the entertaining communal aspect of the game [26].
Initially, the developers of the game pursued educational goals: namely, they
aspired to make blockchain technologies accessible to general public [10, 36]. How-
ever, broad audiences initially became aware of CryptoKitties because of the ridicu-
lously expensive purchases that happened in the first month of its existence [7].
Some suggested that some of these purchases could be connected to money laun-
dering, pointing at the infamous “Cat named Dragon”, which was sold for 600 ETH
(US $170,000 at the time) [11]. Is it a fair price for this token? Is this kitty worth the
money? In the remainder of this paper, I will explore the origins of the playful ethics
that exist in blockchain-based games.
Not long after their introduction, digital ‘kitties’ entered less playful markets
of crypto assets such as Uniswap [44]—I suggest this was the moment when the
economic component of CryptoKitties eventually overshadowed it as a game. Still,
as long as the game was consensual and financially profitable for at least some of its
most economically-mindedplayers, is it possible to call it unfair?After all, the authors
who speculate about the possible future of blockchain suggest that this technology
can enable algorithmic fairness and nurture pro-social behaviour [8, 24, 31, 32] due
to decentralization and wider participation. Still, blockchain-based games remain
a niche entertainment, not least, due to high participation costs that, in the case of
most popular games, require several hundreds of US dollars to even start playing
actively (e.g. [39]; this was also author’s experience with CryptoKitties). It is true
that blockchain technologies grant everyone equal access to ‘crypto games’—which
is considered fair in the design philosophy of blockchain [24]. However, as LaPointe
and Fishbane describe in their ethical framework for blockchains, fairness of such
design is not the same as equity of opportunities for different categories of users [24].
2 Artificial Scarcity on Blockchain
Can blockchain technology make a virtual marketplace fair? Generally speaking,
unfair advantage can be gained through misinformation or concealment of crucial
information about the trade by one side (which is often the case in CryptoKitties,
see [34]). Blockchain platforms address this problem by offering transparency of all
transactions across the blockchain (unless a specialized ‘mixing’ service is applied,
which is effective but also costly). To achieve this, blockchain platforms utilize
cryptographically protected immutable ledgers of all transactions kept on each node
of the network and updated in a decentralized way (e.g. by reaching consensus
between a particular set of nodes). To add another level of fairness, the Ethereum
platform, which was launched in 2015, introduced so-called ‘smart contracts’ that
Fairness by Design: The Fair Game and the Fair … 65
automate transactions based on the pre-defined rule sets (some of such contracts
can still be changed or terminated by the developers) [4]. Due to these features,
blockchain is widely imagined as a technological enabler of trust [29] and even
democracy [4] in the future.
In public blockchains, ethical behavior is further enforced by the proof-of-work
architecture that incentivizes so-called ‘miners’ to verify only the rightful trans-
actions. This architecture ensures trust between the parties that do not trust each
otherwise—at least, this was the goal of Satoshi Nakamoto, the mythical creator of
Bitcoin. Initially, Nakamoto designed a limited supply of Bitcoin, thus introducing
the idea of value based on scarcity to the Bitcoin community; in his project, he hoped
“to pick something that would make prices similar to existing currencies” [29]. This
idea remains an integral part of a widely shared imaginary of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’
[33], inspired by the cryptolibertarian agenda of the community, albeit not without
emancipatory potential, as also seen from the left [1].
In short, the idea of scarcity-based value had been already established in cryp-
tocurrencies, at least, on the semiotic level [28], long before cryptocurrency-based
games. When the latter first appeared, their game designed incorporated ‘artificial
scarcity’ as a seemingly natural basis for value, which can be seen from the white
paper that described CryptoKitties’ design. According to the creators of this game,
the aim of their product was to explore digital scarcity and digital collectibles within
the innovative space of blockchain technologies. An elaborate system of attributes
and traits, ‘genes’, mutations and generations would ensure relative rarity, or, at least,
highly uneven distribution, if not actual scarcity, of certain tokens in the game. How-
ever, the effective sales prices of tokens with different attributes were rarely aligned
with their actual scarcity [37, 38]. Logically, if scarcity was the key to fair prices, it
would be only reasonable to create a calculator of relative value based on scarcity.
Nevertheless, despite several attempts in the community, this was never fully real-
ized. The most commonly used calculator, KittyHelper, only shows ‘the price floor’,
which the lowest price on the market for tokens with different traits and attributes.
As of 2021, the average price for different categories of tokens is not present in its
interface, because it appears to mean very little in the game. Same as on markets of
real-life collectibles, big buyers are mostly concerned about the rarest and most valu-
able tokens, and such tokens are evaluated case by case, quite similarly to antiques
or art works in the real world.
Rarity and uniqueness seem to be more productive, even if almost unpredictable,
criteria to construct potential value of a ‘cryptokitty’ than scarcity. Uniqueness is
literally in the name of a non-fungible Ethereum token (NFT), which each ‘kitty’
represents. Meanwhile, unpredictability is in the core logic of the game, which chal-
lenges luck, rather than skills, of its players. When the developers state that every
blockchain token is unique, they suggest that there is always the chance that it will
acquire higher value in the future—which is exactly the case of the Cat named
Dragon. Paradoxically, it should be worthless according to the rules of the game, as
it does not have any special attributes that would make it scarce. To the experienced
player of the game, it is remarkable for its lack of any marketable traits that would
allow it to sell it for any reasonable price. Still, the 600 Ether transaction is real and
66 A. Serada
registered on blockchain with no possibility to revert it, be it a mistake. We may say
that it is the immutable record of this trade that actually assigns the declared value
to the otherwise worthless kitty. Since the historical event of its purchase, the Cat
named Dragon has been holding the unique title of the most expensive ‘kitty’ in the
world, and if its owner decides to resell it, there will be enough competing buyers to
raise its price even higher.
Scarcity was not the only economical concept for the developers of the game
to play around: they also introduced mechanisms to evaluate demand for particular
tokens. While the open market was set up to determine the prices of ‘second hand’
tokens, the fair price of the ‘first hand’ tokens was decided by the reverse auction
[10]. The ‘smart contract’ established the initial price of these so-called Generation
0 ‘kitties’ based on the state of the market; the price slowly decreased with time, and
players would buy the token when its price matched their assumption of its value.
This would be fair enough to establish the price equilibrium, at least, on the first-
hand market; however, as soon as the game was exposed to human players, its initial
logic was immediately subverted in many speculative practices. Most economically-
thinking players immediately took to ‘flipping’, which means reselling tokens for
profit, typically short term [37]. In order to fetch the rarest or the cheapest kitties,
most technically savvy players immediately started creating trading bots—a practice
that appeared to be unfair to the players who could not afford a bot or did not know
programming. This created a new form of information asymmetry that allowed most
wealthy and educated players to win the game consistently in the economic terms
[34]. However, when asked directly, these players still consider the game general fair.
Gradually, the community deciphered the complete ‘genome’ of CryptoKitties,
built ‘breeding calculators’ and even ‘autobreeders’ based on it [12], which some-
times made human participation in the game rather inefficient. Still, all this was
considered a meaningful part of the game—playful practices that were commonly
accepted by the core player base as ‘fair’. When I started my research of pricing
in CryptoKitties, my goal was to find a meaningful distinction between ‘fair’ and
‘unfair’ price. It took me a long time to realize that my subjective ethics do not apply
in the virtual world. For instance, many players set the prices far above the expected
price on the market, and novice players sometimes buy into this—their loss! I first
saw it as unfair, but it appears to be a universally accepted way to play—same as
negotiating at a bazaar. When I asked the players about what they consider fair in
the game, some of them suggested that an inflated price is not unfair, as this is also
a part of play. Later, I asked the developer of another successful blockchain-based
game in a private conversation, how they differentiate between honest players and
speculators, and he replied: “All players are speculators! This is the essence of the
game”. The same can be said about CryptoKitties, which demonstrates once again
that the concept of a ‘fair price’ appears to have a playful dimension that complicates
any economic description of it, as well as ethical evaluation.
To sum it up, neither reverse auction nor calculation of relative scarcity would
be sufficient to establish what is considered a ‘fair price’ in CryptoKitties. Same
as at oriental bazaars [18], also used for video game trading [13], the pricing is
always performative and relational. In the end, the idea of a ‘fair price’ seems to
Fairness by Design: The Fair Game and the Fair … 67
emerge fromdynamic tradingpractices and social relations: generally, the community
has some kind of a shared idea about what is fair in the game at each particular
point of it. Although this question of ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ prices has always baffled
the community of blockchain gamers, the inevitable information asymmetry and
completely puzzling unpredictability of prices never ‘spoilt the game’ for its core
players.
3 Why Are Games not Always Fair?
The question of (un-)fairness appears to be much more complicated in game studies,
as well. A game is considered fair when everyone has an equal and fair chance to win
the prize that is proportional to their input [5]. Cheating creates the unfair advantage
for the cheater [9], although this unfairness is often perceived rather than calculated.
In mainstream game studies, a fair game is often understood more broadly as an
ethical game [40]. All its players not just get even or fairly proportional chances to
win, they also have an equal right to enjoy the game in general. This right comes
with the responsibility of being a ‘virtuous player’who cooperateswith other players,
avoids cheating and confrontation other than in a rule-driven combat or competition.
This is the desired norm in several foundational works of game studies [6, 21, 40],
as well as many later developments of video game ethics.
Edward Castronova, a game economist, was one of the first to study fairness in
virtual worlds. He developed his vision based on early multiplayer games such as
Ultima Online and Second Life. Castronova is also one of the most consistently
neoliberal scholars: he sees the purpose of play in accumulation of ‘gaming capital’
based on meritocracy. To comply with this purpose, virtual worlds must have pre-
designed conditions and rules set by the ‘coding authority’; these rules are deemed
fair if the player accepts them. For instance, if a game world reproduces gender
inequality, a player is free to leave this world for a different one with different rules
“in which both genders are equally skilled and equally objectified”, supposedly built
by a nongovernmental organization to prove their point [6, p. 142]. Such ethical code
is based on a set pre-defined external rules that do not account for internal conflicts
of a social systems. Theoretical ‘fairness’ is easily distorted to sanction unfair and
antisocial behaviour towards less privileged or simply less lucky members of the
gaming community. The rules of such community are still negotiable, even if not
always ‘virtuous’: for instance, the members of a particular online game to be unfair
to female players, but punish cheating, deception and antisocial behaviour in other
situations [41].
The question of practical game ethics has been reframed by Mia Consalvo in
her empirical study Cheating. Gaining Advantage in Videogames [9]. Her studies
of ‘gaming capital’ reveal that it does not always correspond to the rational ideal
of ‘meritocracy’, but is rather a construct within the existing economic and social
relations that arise in and aroundgaming cultures.Gaining and especiallymaintaining
and acknowledging symbolic capital in games implies that the gamer shall not cheat.
68 A. Serada
Gaming communities usually have some kind of a shared vision of fairness, as well
as communal agreements that support pro-social interactions and enable joyous and
relatively conflict-free collective play.
Let us take a closer look at some of the multiple understandings of cheating that
Consalvo’s research reveals. For instance, in the eyes of some players, unfairness
comes from gaining an advantage from the external information that does not belong
to the space where the game challenge is taking place. From this viewpoint, cheating
is use of any other sources of information apart from the affordances of the game
itself [9]. Meanwhile, if we apply this understanding to the game of CryptoKitties,
we will find it unfair by design. It seems to have run on informational asymmetries
from the start: for example, unequal opportunities between the players who can and
cannot code, and, of course, the privileged position of thosewho already had a history
of owning cryptocurrencies. Finally, it would be impossible to play the game without
referring to external sources of information in the first year of its existence: the game
mechanics were obscure, and it did not even have a complete player guide [12].
Players had to leave the ‘magic circle’ of the game and ask the community how
various features of CryptoKitties worked. Even though there was very little drama
in the community as compared to an average server of a multiplayer game, there was
always the risk that the early adopters would play a trick or two on the newcomers,
which would typically cost them certain amounts of the cryptocurrency Ether. In the
end, limiting the access to the external sources of information would make it almost
impossible to play the game, as its very point was exploration of the novel blockchain
technology.
Unsurprisingly, the inherent informational asymmetry between seasoned players
and newcomers have not resulted in a particularly healthymarket. Due to it, the prices
on the marketplace were often intentionally inflated far above the generally agreed
benchmark with the hope to catch a clueless newbie or an ignorant ‘crypto whale’,
or generally to manipulate the price level for certain tokens. All this is nothing new
in multiplayer games: Consalvo mentions similar fraudulent transactions, aimed to
inflate prices of in-game objects, in the early digital children’s game Whyville in
2006 [9, p. 117]. Allegedly, the same techniques has been consequently used on the
emerging markets of NFTs in 2021.
Yet another conceptualization of fairness, according to Consalvo, states that the
game is fair when it is played truthfully to the game code and design. Consalvo
connects this idea to the ‘code is law’ principle, which she finds in Lawrence Lessig
[9, p. 90]. This is where we discover the genetic link between the understanding of
‘fairness’ in video games and on cryptocurrency markets. Many blockchain adopters
reproduce the same belief as Lessig, which originated from the early cyber-anarchism
[16]. To them, ‘code writers’ of the internet are also its ‘lawmakers’. To ‘play fair’ is
to act according to the affordances of the code, allegedly designed in an ‘algorithmi-
cally fair’ way. This may seem redundant, as the rules set in smart contracts cannot
be broken by design [4]; however, interests of other players or market participants are
not a part of this rule-based technocentric ethical system. According to its adopters,
exploitation of weaknesses of other players is fair as long as the pre-established rules
are followed and the original code of the game is not corrupted. It must be noted,
Fairness by Design: The Fair Game and the Fair … 69
though, that communities of blockchain adopters have their own ethical code that pro-
hibits openly anti-social behaviour such as stealing another person’s cryptocurrency
or ‘mining’ it on someone else’s property without permission [3, p. 96]. Speaking of
CryptoKitties, there have always been ambiguous cases that tested even this, rather
straightforward ‘law is code’ principle, such as trading bots or exploits that allowed
gaining Ether by force-executing the ‘birthing contract’. However, there are no coded
rules in the game that would discourage speculation. The code of the game puts no
limits on the price one might want to value their property for sale, so they are free
to name any price (such as, 600 Ether for the Cat named Dragon), and other players
are free to pay the price if they have the money. It is the responsibility of players
to reduce information asymmetry and ‘do their own research’ before conducting a
trade.
4 Designing Fair Competition
According to the normative game ethics, players become moral beings by following
the rules of the game. This remains true if the rules of the game violate personal
ethical code of players in real life, e.g. in violent games. From the perspective, as
presented by Miguel Sicart, the player-subject is defined by the rules of the game,
and her main virtue is fidelity: “The fidelity of the player is present as long as her
actions are coherent with the game rules and the game world, and do not contradict
a rule” [40, p. 74]. When we study games as ludic systems that consist of rules, we
have to accept that in-game rules override extraludic ethics—which, by the way, can
also be used in productive and positive ways to create ethically interesting games, as
Sicart later describes in more detail.
Following the rules is particularly important in multiplayer games. Sicart stresses
that cheating breaks the game experience: it is detrimental not only for the cheater,
but for other players as well. By prioritising the rule system of the game, its ethics
appeal to the broader technocratic “code is law” principle. Such rule-based game
ethics rightfully dominate in highly competitive games: most of such games are not
about reaching the consensus between the participants and certainly not about the
situation when everybody wins. To the contrary, competitive games always include
an element of justifiable suffering, such as the risk to lose, to feel frustrated and
humiliated. The ethical threshold for the potential harm is decided by the community,
and, just as any social rules, it is always highly contextual and constantly negotiated.
Nguyen and Zagal come up with two criteria for ethical competition: “It depends,
first, on consent and second, on the motivational set-up of the players” [30], namely,
their willingness to endure a certain degree of violence. As a result, there is no ethical
problem in spoiling the game for the disadvantaged (i.e. less experienced) members
in manymultiplayer games, as long as everybody follows the rules of the game itself.
This leaves designers of multiplayer games with the almost impossible challenge
to make the competition as fair as possible, at least, at the level of the game system,
which some players will inevitable try to exploit, while others will complain and
70 A. Serada
threaten the developers. Skewed chances in the game are the usual source of discon-
tent (the second one being game developers, personal and professional qualities). As
early as in “Synthetic Worlds” [6], Castronova observes early gaming communities
trying to negotiate with developers about a fairer and more balanced game—a scene
familiar to anyone who has ever participated in any multiplayer game, from Destiny
2 to FarmVille 2. Mia Consalvo provides a similar description of the world of Final
Fantasy XI. Speaking of virtual economies, players may even require developers to
prevent other players from gaining an unfair advantage by financial means [22].
Is fair competition even possible? It appears that Roger Caillois disputed the
possibility of fair competition in games long before digital games even came into
being [5]. As long as players of a game originate from different social stratas, they
will always have advantages and disadvantages predefined by their access to wealth,
education and training, before the game has even begun. The only case of absolutely
fair competition appears to be gambling, and exactly this mechanics lies at the core of
CryptoKitties [35]. Gambling, however, is unethical when it becomes an addiction,
and this side of blockchain-based games also needs urgent research.
In summary, the rule-based approach to game ethics, which prioritises games
as systems, is not without its merit: it provides novel creative opportunities and
relative simplicity of designing and running games. Still, we might wonder how
following external rules makes us a ‘virtuous player’: these rules could have been set
by a potentially immoral subject or a corporate entity such as a business firm, who
produce almost all popular games. Besides, this type of game ethics does not protect
the underprivileged, such as the playerswho do not have enough symbolic or financial
capital to participate in a game to the fullest degree—or just those who have entered
the game at a later stage. In the end, CryptoKitties was not designed as a competitive
game—it was envisioned as creative exploration of blockchain technologies that
everyone could try for themselves. Unfortunately, this Utopian project ended up in
much frustration for casual and not particularly wealthy players.
5 Second Morality?
Literature on cheating suggests that buying in-game wealth and power on external
markets for real money is often considered an unfair advantage [9, 22]. Interestingly,
‘crypto game’ developers are very eager to give the players the right to buy and
sell their in-game rewards for real money, which contrasts with the traditional ethics
of early MMO games, where buying and selling items violated implicit and even
explicit rules of the game[9, p. 164]. Today the ability to buy and sell in-game
upgrades, power-ups and particularlymightyweapons became the basis for extensive
monetization [27], especially in the free-to-play games that are sometimes criticized
as ‘pay to win’. Upon closer inspection, almost all blockchain-based games are ‘pay
to win’ by design, but this is the topic for another time.
As for now, almost all online games have internal virtual economies and markets
for various digital commodities. Prices are usually set by developers, publishers,
Fairness by Design: The Fair Game and the Fair … 71
or game marketing specialists—in other words, some kind of a ‘coding authority’.
Some multiplayer games (for instance, Team Fortress 2 (2007) and Counter Strike:
Global Offensive (2012) published by Valve) and virtual worlds, such as Second Life
(2003), have peer-to-peer markets where players can trade in-game objects and set
their own prices. As soon as the prices get out of control of the ‘coding authority’,
speculation with digital commodities flourishes, sometimes despite all technological
limitations and preventive measures, on which honest and virtuous players insist. An
early case of such speculation in massive multiplayer online games has been first
thoroughly described in an autoethnographic study by Julian Dibbell, later published
as a personal narrative [14].
For the most part, the spirit of CryptoKitties is reminiscent of these ‘grey’ mar-
kets of virtual goods sprawling around the Steam game platform and even external
‘black’ markets of game items and characters in multiplayer games such as World
of Warcraft. These game markets of the not quite forgotten past are notorious for
cheating, speculation and legal disputes [2, 15, 17, 19, 42]. On the other hand, lib-
ertarian economists, such as Castronova and his like-minded colleagues Lastowka
and Hunter, tend to conceptualize in-game speculation in mostly positive economic
terms [25], with the hope that the equilibrium of prices is achievable, and virtual
economies will eventually mature into the state of efficient self-regulation. This is
also the goal of blockchain-based games, although the most long-living one seems
to demonstrate stagnation rather than maturation in economic terms.
Interestingly, the same game may be found ethical or unethical when seen from
either a normative (rule-based) or a descriptive (player-centric) approach in game
studies. From the cyberlibertarian perspective, SecondLife is an ethical virtualworld,
because its rules allow players to gain wealth proportionally to their time and input
[6]. However, such claims should not be taken by face value, as many similar virtual
economies, such as EVE Online, also allow players to gain wealth much faster by
piracy and grey market trade. To Sicart, EVE Online is an ethical game because
everybody has equal chances in it. He is aware of piracy, but he suggests that the
informal pirate code is at least as important as the official rules of the game (refusing to
be a pirate in Eve Online may disrupt gaming experience of other players). Learning
to be a cosmic pirate is such an important part of the game that players lose their
‘virtual subjectivity’ if they do not engage into it to the degree required by the
community [40, p. 72]. This is in line with the idea of different subjectivities that an
individual wears ‘inside’ and ‘outside’ of virtual worlds.
An interesting question here is at which point the ‘inside subjectivity’ becomes
responsible for their deeds according to the jurisdiction that their physical body
belongs to. This is inevitable when the players who have lost their virtual property
seek justice at a real life court [15, 22]—and it becomes even clearer when real-life
financial crimes are conducted by the use of the affordances of virtual worlds. It
has been noted many times that design of Second Life affords financial crimes in
the real world [42]. The same, to a much greater degree, is true for the affordances
of blockchain technologies [22, 42], which calls for more research in its highly
speculative markets.
72 A. Serada
In this light, the final point to consider is the double morality of game own-
ers and publishers. Initially, developers of CryptoKitties criticized the practice of
manipulating scarcity on virtual markets as unfair [10] (see also [27] on its nega-
tive impact on virtual economies). Blockchain technology provided an antidote: the
code of CryptoKitties should prevent even the developers themselves from creating
new ‘scarcities’. However, Dapper Lab started doing exactly that later the same year.
Since 2018, developers have been regularly introducing new limited edition ‘fancies’
to keep the game alive. These new categories of tokens have always had higher value
than regular ‘kitties’ on the inflated market. This is very different from projects like
CryptoPunks [23], which have a limited amount of tokens that cannot be exceeded,
and these tokens are in fact only getting more expensive. Their actual scarcity has
led to a curious project that creates a digital double for an existing CryptoPunk on
Ethereum, so another layer of value is developed on the crypto market, which offers
financial rewards in the form of bounties, lending and depositing particularly rare
tokens that may not even change hands in the process [45], also somewhat similarly
to the real world art market. While developers of CryptoKitties pointed at CryptoP-
unks as an example of a fizzled-out project in 2018, the latter are still highly valued
in 2021, and they still deliver the initial agenda of their creators, as any piece of
‘crypto art’ should aspire to do.
6 Conclusion. Ethics of Blockchain Versus Ethics
of Its Adopters
Can fairness be reinforced by immutable ledgers, ‘smart contracts’ and finan-
cial incentives, as the latest projects of blockchain-based governance suggest? A
‘fair price’ on a crypto market does not have a fixed transparent value secured in
blockchain, and is acquired in a process akin to bargaining on an oriental market
[18]. In this paper, I hope to have demonstrated that such price is established in a
playful collective action, as a part of supposedly ‘fair game’. This playful attitude
may be characteristic to blockchain-based markets in general.
In technocentric communities of ‘crypto gamers’, game ethics is mostly derived
from the same ‘code is law’ principle that is so important for the blockchain com-
munity. In game studies, the ‘code is law’ principle corresponds to the rule-based
(normative) perspective that places game rules above real life ethics and laws. Ide-
ally, a fair game encourages all its participants to play in an honest and rational way,
and this encouragement is not limited to game rewards: it includes, for example,
the sense of belonging to a certain community and acquiring symbolic capital. In
practice, when game ethics is externalized as a system of rules set in code in an
‘unreal’ virtual world, nothing—not even one’s moral compass—can prevent the
player from cheating and abusing others, as soon as there is space for free play in the
codified game system. This is also noticeable in CryptoKitties. In theory, the game
was designed in accordance with the principles of ‘ethical games’ [40]: blockchain
is expected to ensure transparency of transactions, and its ‘smart contracts’ are set
Fairness by Design: The Fair Game and the Fair … 73
up to produce artificial scarcity. In practice, we can observe ubiquitous speculation,
cheating and other deviations from prescribed prosocial behaviour. Still, this does
not spoil the game for the most faithful players.
Longbefore blockchain-basedgames, empirical studies have consistently revealed
the anti-social side of multiplayer game worlds. In fact, the in-game morality of its
players does not seem to differ much from their general ethical disposition [17];
cheating and speculation inevitably emerge in collective play and flourish in some
communities that tolerate or even encourage such behaviour as a part of the game.
Virtual worlds apply ‘double morality’ to the actions of in-game and out-of-game
subjects, whichmay afford offensive behaviour in the game and even financial crimes
in the real world. Still, researchers believe that game communities can, and will, rule
themselves in a democratic way to prevent cheating and abuse. This is one of the
contributions that blockchain-based games can possibly offer to more generalized
game research. Almost every blockchain-based game in 2018–2019 demonstrated
very active collective decision making among players and developers, even though,
probably, it was due to the community rather than the technology. I suggest that
this can be a potentially valuable tendency to follow in game development—as long
as reliance on community does not become a tool to extract free labour from its
members, which would be a different kind of unfairness.
In gaming, blockchain is suggested to provide ‘trustlessness’ by removing inter-
mediaries, such as game publishers, from interactions between players. However, it
does not prevent neither players nor developers from exploiting each other’s trust
and creating new information asymmetries. In this regard, blockchain-based games
do not differ from early online multiplayer games. The ethics of blockchain-based
games is not defined its ‘smart contracts’ and immutable ledgers. Instead, it is the
collective responsibility of their developers and users. There is nothing special about
blockchain that could prevent its unethical application—in fact, some of its prop-
erties, such as decentralization and anonymity, actively invite cheating, speculation
and gambling. In the end, game publishers are responsible for their product regard-
less of technology they use, and they have to comply with legal regulations when
playful unfairness bleeds into the real world. Not all players are ‘virtuous’, neither
all of them want to be, and the same is true for game developers. If the rules of a ‘fair
game’ allow speculation, then any price is ‘fair’, but this also means that, much like
in gambling, the only safe strategy to avoid losses is to avoid the game altogether.
