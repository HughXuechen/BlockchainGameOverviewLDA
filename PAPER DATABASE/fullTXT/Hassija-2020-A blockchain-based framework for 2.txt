ABSTRACT
The rapidly increasing mobile traffic across the globe has prolifer-
ated the deployment of cellular base stations, which has, in turn, led
to an increase in the power consumption and carbon footprint of the
telecommunications industry. In recent times, solar-powered base
stations (SPBSs) have gained much popularity in the telecom sector
due to their ability to make operations more sustainable. However,
some potential energy benefits rendered by the SPBSs have not yet
been realized. In areas with dense base station deployment or low
mobile traffic, SPBSs store surplus energy, which, in most instances,
gets lost due to limited charge storage capacity of the batteries. To
limit the wastage of energy, an appropriate mechanism enabling
the utilization of excess energy produced by these base stations can
be adopted. To this end, we model a Base Station-to-Grid (BS2G)
network in which the grid can utilize surplus energy spared by
the SPBSs. To overcome challenges in regards to scalability, ro-
bustness, and cost-optimization, we propose using the blockchain
technology to create the BS2G network. Blockchain is a distributed
ledger designed to record transactions in a transparent, lightweight,
and tamper-proof manner. To make energy trade between base
stations and the grid cost-effective, a game-theoretical approach
has also been adopted in this paper. The proposed model simplifies
the process of energy trading while also making it cost-optimal.

1 INTRODUCTION
Owing to the rapid increase in the number of cellular users, and
consequently, the number of cellular base stations, the strain on
the environment has been massive. This is primarily due to the
heavy reliance of the majority of off-grid and bad-grid cellular base
stations on diesel generators for their power requirements. The
impact of the wide-scale use of diesel generators been twofold: 1)
an increase in the operating cost and 2) an increase in the carbon
footprint. In recent times, multiple solutions have been proposed
to reduce the dependency of the base stations on diesel generators.
Among them, the use of solar-powered base stations (SPBSs) has
emerged as a promising one [5]. SPBSs have made telecom oper-
ations smart, sustainable, and green by reducing the reliance of
off-grid BSs on diesel generators for their energy requirements.
SPBSs have made an extensive contribution towards energy ef-
ficiency in the telecommunications industry. However, in remote
areas, particularly in low mobile-traffic areas, solar power utilized
by the SPBSs is often less than the solar power generated. Some
of the excess energy is stored locally by the SPBSs for emergency
purposes, but most of it is wasted. In this work, the smart grid tech-
nology is envisioned as a solution to solve this issue and maximize
energy efficiency. Smart grids are expected to be a cutting-edge
power grid technology with the potential to facilitate energy trade
between SPBSs and the grid. To allow SPBSs to trade their excess
amount of energy with the grid, we introduce the concept of Base
Station-to-Grid (BS2G) networks. BS2G is a framework that enables
an SPBS to trade its excess energy with the electric grid in exchange
for some monetary benefit. The primary advantage of such a net-
work is that it can enable an SPBS to sell or purchase energy from
the grid subject to its requirements. Via this network, surplus en-
ergy generated by the SPBSs can be transferred to the smart grids
and stored in the Electric Storage Units (ESUs) [8]. This energy can
later be used to meet the local neighborhood’s energy requirements.
In recent times, several energy-trading frameworks in the domain

Figure 1: Proposed BS2G Framework
of smart grid energy trading have come to the forefront [16], [20],
[22]. The game-theoretic frameworks adopted in the literature are,
however, based primarily on classical game theory. Although such
frameworks provide a suitable approach to resolve games involving
multiple players with each player looking to maximize its gain, they
are constrained by classical theory’s inherent assumption that every
player has knowledge of all sets of strategies and payoff functions.
In real-life interactions, however, this assumption seldom holds.
The evolutionary game theory (EGT) allows for a model that does
not penalize the participants for having precise information about
their own strategies only. In an evolutionary game, players can
still change their strategies by comparing their current behavior
strategy with the chosen alternative. Furthermore, the success of a
classical game theory model depends on the ability of players to
make rational choices. However, in the case of evolutionary theory,
rational decision making is not a prerequisite.
In terms of network architecture, one significant drawback of
existing frameworks is their dependence on centralized servers that
may act as a single point of failure. Moreover, the energy exchange
between the grids and the SPBSs would require a large number
of financial transactions. For such a large number of transactions,
the traditional method of storing every single energy transaction
on a centralized database is not plausible [19]. Another significant
issue with centralized frameworks is their lack of transparency and
vulnerability to several kinds of malicious attacks. The security,
scalability, and transparency concerns associated with centralized
frameworks impede their reliability drastically.
To this end, the use of a distributed ledger technology (DLT),
such as blockchain, is a promising option to register each energy
or data transaction. Being immutable by design, blockchain can
ensure that no entity can alter the transaction records or dispute
its authenticity in the future. Another added advantage of using
blockchain is that it can facilitate the adoption of cryptocurrency in
such transactions [7]. The use of cryptocurrency, combined with the
deployment of a game-theoretic smart contract on the blockchain
network, can automate the process of energy trading between SPBSs
and grids. By effectively modeling the dynamics of the energy
exchange, adoption of an EGT in the smart contract further ensures:
1) optimality in terms of the price of energy, 2) efficiency in terms of
the time taken to reach an evolutionary stable strategy, 3) fairness
in the interactions between all the parties, and 4) compliance of all
exchanges with a predefined set of rules.
1.1 Our Contributions
The major contributions of this work are as follows:
(1) This paper proposes a Base Station-to-Grid (BS2G) frame-
work to limit the wastage of energy generated by the SPBSs.
(2) A blockchain-enabled energy tradingmodel has been adopted
to overcome the scalability, transparency, and security con-
cerns associated with centralized architectures.
(3) A smart contract that facilitates the automation of peer-to-
peer (P2P) energy trading has also been deployed on our
blockchain-based BS2G network. These P2P energy trades
help reduce the cost of energy to the grid as they do not
require any third party involvement.
(4) The implementation of an Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT)
in the smart contract further ensures cost-optimization in
the energy trading environment. As opposed to other game-
theoretic approaches, an EGT is more focused on the chang-
ing dynamics of the strategy adopted by the players, in this
case, the SPBSs. This makes an EGT a suitable approach for
our model that involves a multi-iteration competition among
the SPBSs to win the energy trading task.
1.2 Organization
The rest of the work is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss
the relevant works in the direction of sustainable base stations
and game-theoretic energy trading frameworks for smart grids.
Section 3 and Section 4 discuss the fundamental infrastructure
of our proposed BS2G model and the implementation of a game-
theoretic smart contract, respectively. Section 5 includes the results
from our simulations, while Section 6 finally concludes this work.
2 RELATEDWORK
The rapid increase in cellular traffic has made the need for energy-
efficient and self-reliant BSs very evident. Presently, much research
316
A Blockchain-based Framework for Energy Trading between Solar Powered Base Stations and Grid BlockNet ’20, October 11–14, 2020, Boston, MA, USA
is being conducted to power BSs using renewable energy sources
(RES) such as solar and wind energy [2].
The authors of [21] have proposed the use of an integrated pho-
tovoltaic (PV) system as a power source for BSs located in regions
where the electricity from the grid is unavailable. As per their
results, the PV system is capable of meeting the electrical load re-
quirement of the base station. The authors have also carried out a
financial analysis of the PV system and asserted it to be an affordable
solution for off-grid base stations to meet their load requirements.
To determine the feasibility of using PV panels, the authors of
[14] thoroughly study the power consumption and traffic profiles
of several base stations that rely solely on renewable energy. In the
paper, the authors focus on the dimensioning of PV panels in base
stations located in remote locations. The paper also investigates
the efficacy of using wind turbines in tandem with the PV panels.
In [18], Daniela Renga et al. have proposed a power supply sys-
tem that consists of small units composed of solar renewable energy
(RE) generators to power individual Base Stations (BSs). These gen-
erators are combined with energy storage units (ESUs) to sustain
the BS operation during the night or other low production periods.
To simulate their power supply system, the authors have developed
a simple stochastic model of the daily RE production. Their simula-
tions show that the mean production values help to differentiate an
insufficient production system from a sufficient one, while the vari-
ance in production helps in estimating the system’s performance.
In the domain of smart grids, various game-theoretic energy
trading frameworks have come forward in recent years [16]. For
example, the authors of [20] have proposed a novel game-theoretic
framework to model the energy trading interactions of several
storage units such as hybrid electric vehicles. The framework es-
tablishes a non-cooperative game between storage units and smart
grid elements, where each storage unit’s owner aims to maximize
his/her utility by deciding the maximum amount of energy to sell.
The framework further leverages an auction mechanism to de-
termine the energy trading price. As per the simulation results
presented in the paper, the proposed framework renders substantial
performance enhancements over the conventional greedy approach.
The game-theoretic approach adopted in [22] makes use of a
modified regret matching procedure to enable energy trading be-
tween users. This approach enables users with an energy-surplus
to sell their remnant energy gathered from renewable sources at a
profit while allowing users with an energy-deficit to get energy at
a discounted price.
Although most of the works in the domain of energy trading
rely on centralized architectures, some researchers have also shown
interest in developing a blockchain-based decentralized network
for P2P energy trading [9]. Jiawen Kang et al. [10] have put forth
a P2P electricity trading system for EVs based on a consortium
blockchain. Esther Mengelkamp et al. [15] have discussed the bene-
fits and drawbacks of incorporating blockchain in energy trading
techniques by simulating a blockchain-based local energy market
(LEM). The authors of [12] analyze the feasibility of a decentral-
ized approach to the energy trading market by evaluating their
proposed blockchain-based electricity exchange market comprising
of multiple electric vehicles and a grid. Blockchain has been used
in their model to ensure scalability in the grid system and facilitate
autonomy in the trading environment.
Although a few decentralized energy trading frameworks have
surfaced in recent years, none of them have been implemented in
the domain of BS2G energy trading. In this paper, we present a novel
game-theoretic BS2G energy trading model based on blockchain.
Blockchain has been used in our model since it is a decentralized,
peer-to-peer (P2P) network that provides a secure transaction plat-
form with no central or controlling authority [1], [17]. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first time blockchain has been used to
model energy trading between SPBSs and smart grids.
3 SYSTEM MODEL
In the proposed system model, we consider a network that com-
prises of multiple SPBSs and smart grids. In the proposed model,
each SPBS and grid alike, will act as both a producer and a con-
sumer, i.e., as a prosumer [4], [6]. The user functions as a customer
when the amount of energy it requires exceeds the amount of en-
ergy it generates. Moreover, the user may function as the seller if
it holds a surplus amount of energy, i.e., the amount of energy it
produces exceeds its energy requirement. Expenses may vary with
the generation and consumption of energy owing to:
1. Climatic conditions: In comparison to the cold weather,
the PhotoVoltaic (PV) panels generate more energy in the
summer, which implies that there is a higher likelihood of
surplus energy being generated during the summers. In ad-
dition, the load on the grid is higher during the summers
due to higher energy requirements.
2. Time of the day: The demand for electricity, as well as
the output from PV panels, varies with the time of the day.
For instance, the presence of multiple users at home in the
mornings leads to an increased demand for electricity, and
consequently, an increased load on the grid.
3. Balanced electricity grid: The costs incurred for energy
consumption should vary with time and season, i.e., the cost
for energy should be higher during peak times as compared
to the off-peak time.
3.1 BS2G Network Architecture
Let P = {1, 2, . . . , 𝑖, . . . , 𝑁 } with 𝑖 ∈ P represent the set of SPBSs
and Q = {1, 2, . . . , 𝑗, . . . , 𝑀} with 𝑗 ∈ Q represent the set of smart
grids. All the 𝑁 SPBSs and 𝑀 smart grids are considered to be the
part of an ethereum network, which stores all the data associated
with energy transactions between SPBSs and the grid on its own.
Furthermore, an unbiased node, not controlled by any party, known
as a smart contract, is deployed across the network. A smart contract
is executed whenever any node requests for some data or shares
energy.
If𝑇 = {1, 2, . . . , 𝑡, . . . , 24} denotes the set of 1-hour time-intervals
in a day, then the amount of power generated during these timeslots
by an SPBS 𝑖 and a grid 𝑗 can be represented as follows:
𝑆𝑖 =
{
𝑆1𝑖 , 𝑆

𝐺 𝑗 =

The consumption profile of an SPBS 𝑖 and a grid 𝑗 can be represented
in a similar fashion:
𝑆 ′𝑖 =
{

}
, 𝑗 ∈ Q (4)
To ensure the availability of power during periods of solar power
unavailability, such as the night time, we assume that the SPBSs
store a fraction of the surplus energy generated by them inside the
batteries. Similarly, we assume that all smart grids are equipped
with an ESU that enable the storage of electricity during times of
peak production, i.e., when the production exceeds the consump-
tion, and the release of energy when the consumption exceeds the
production.
3.2 Classifying Buyers and Sellers
In this work, we model the BS2G exchange only, i.e., SPBSs are
considered to be the sellers while the grids are considered to be the
buyers. However, the SPBS may supply energy to the grid only if
the amount of excess energy it holds exceeds the minimum storage
threshold. The minimum storage threshold is the minimum amount
of energy that an SPBS should store in its batteries for emergency
purposes. If \𝑡
𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑖
denotes the minimum storage threshold of an
SPBS 𝑖 ∈ P, then the amount of energy that the SPBS can deliver,
\𝑡
𝑖
during the 𝑡𝑡ℎ timeslot is calculated as follows:
\𝑡𝑖 = 𝑆𝑡𝑖 −
(
𝑆𝑡
′
𝑖 + \𝑡𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑖
)
(5)
Furthermore, the amount of energy required by the grid 𝑗 ,Z𝑡
𝑗
at
time 𝑡 can be calculated as follows:
Z𝑡
𝑗 = 𝐺𝑡 ′
𝑗 + `𝑡𝑗 −𝐺𝑡
𝑗 (6)
where `𝑡
𝑗
represents the amount of energy available in the ESU
connected to the 𝑗𝑡ℎ grid during the 𝑡𝑡ℎ timeslot.
4 GAME THEORY IN BS2G NETWORK
In our model, we use an evolutionary game theory (EGT) based
smart contract to optimize the costs associated with energy trading
between the smart grids and the SPBSs. Evolutionary game mod-
els provide a natural approach to problems in which the strategy
adopted by the players changes over time, and the outcome for each
player depends on the actions of others as well as its own. Since our
network involves a competition between multiple SPBSs wherein
each SPBS continuously changes its strategy to win the energy
trading task, an EGT provides a promising model to ensure nash
equilibrium among the players of our network. In our framework,
smart grids employ the use of the EGT model to select the most ben-
eficial SPBS from which to buy energy. Once the SPBSs reveal their
energy prices, each grid selects an SPBS from which to purchase
energy. Each grid’s selection procedure is adjusted gradually, and
an SPBS is chosen independently by the grids during the selection
process. The probability of SPBS 𝑖 being chosen by the grid 𝑗 in 𝑡𝑡ℎ
hour, 𝜋𝑡
𝑖, 𝑗
is randomly initialised ∀𝑖 ∈ P and ∀𝑗 ∈ Q. The overall
demand for energy coming to the SPBS 𝑖 at time period 𝑡 , 𝛾𝑡
𝑖
can be
mathematically formulated as follows,
𝛾𝑡𝑖 =
M∑

The ratio of supply and the overall demand for SPBS 𝑖 at 𝑡𝑡ℎ hour
can be given by:

5 NUMERICAL ANALYSIS
5.1 Simulation Settings
The solar power generation profile of an 8 kW peak power photo-
voltaic (PV) base station has been taken from [14] while the power
load profile for a remote telecom base station has been taken from
[11]. It is important to note that the hourly power generation profile
of the PV base station has been averaged over the month that ca-
pacitates the least power generation. In the months of peak power
production, power generation values will be much higher.
The model that we use is built upon the generic ethereum frame-
work that provides a public blockchain network based on proof
of work consensus algorithm. In the future part of this work, we
would consider a private network enabled with other consensus
algorithms that are more effective in terms of computation. For sim-
ulating our game-theoretic smart contract, we consider an ethereum
test network - Rinkeby, consisting of 4 SPBSs and 2 grids. Every
SPBS can trade energy with any one of the grids in exchange for
ethers (cryptocurrency). Since SPBSs can generate energy during
day time only, we assume that our BS2G model is operational only
during the day. To verify the scalability of the proposed solution,
we have used the Titan XP GPU to run the model.
5.2 Performance Evaluation
Figure 2 plots the hourly power consumption profile of a remote
telecom base station as well as the solar power production profile
of an SPBS. It can be inferred from the graph that even though
solar power is available for a limited number of hours, the amount
of solar power generated in those hours is more than sufficient
to account for the power unavailability during the rest of the day.
Since an SPBS cannot generate power in the early part of the day,
initially, the net power generation of an SPBS is negative. Later, as
the day progresses and the SPBS harnesses solar energy to generate
power, the net power generation becomes positive. Even though
the energy stored inside the battery depletes towards the latter half
of the day, the SPBS remains energy surplus at the end of the day.
To further demonstrate the need for a BS2G framework, we con-
sider the following case. An 8 kW peak production solar-powered
base station can, on average, produce 5 kW of solar power ev-
ery hour. Taking into account its immediate power requirements,
around 4 kW of solar power of excess power is generated by a
remote SPBS every hour. If we consider a pack of 12V 200Ah lead-
acid batteries to store energy for emergency purposes, we need
12*200 = 2400Wh energy to recharge a single battery completely.
However, assuming that the batteries have 70% depth-of-discharge
(DoD), the energy requirement falls to 2400*0.70 = 1680Wh. Taking
into account the losses associated with charging and discharging
of a battery, we assume that the battery’s efficiency is 80%. An
80% efficiency corresponds to an energy requirement of 1680/0.80
= 2100Wh to recharge a single battery. If we consider a battery
pack comprising of 8 batteries, as is common with telecom base
stations, then the energy requirement becomes 8*2100 = 16800Wh.
For an SPBS with a 4 kW rating, this corresponds to a charge time
of 16800Wh/4000W = 4.2 hours. These calculations demonstrate
that an SPBS with access to six hours of sunlight could lose as much
as two hours worth of solar power in a single day. It is important
to note that these calculations have been carried out, keeping in
mind the values for a low-traffic remote base station.
Figure 3 shows the variation in probabilities of a particular SPBS
getting selected by the grid for energy exchange over multiple
iterations. The variations in probabilities for grid 1 and grid 2 are
shown separately in fig. 2(a) and 2(b) respectively. Initially, i.e., for
iteration 0, the selection probabilities are random. However, over
multiple iterations, the selection probabilities converge to their
optimal value. The graphs show that as the iterations increase,
the selection probabilities of both the grids continue to change.
This change is attributed to the fact that all SPBSs update their
energy trading price after each iteration in order to win the energy
trading task. The algorithm assigns a higher selection probability to
the SPBS whose energy prices are more favorable to the grid. The
optimal values of probabilities are achieved when the grids achieve
a stable state where they no longer change their selection strategy.
Such a stable condition is referred to as an evolutionary stable
strategy (ESS). For grid 1, the optimal probabilities were achieved
in the 10𝑡ℎ iteration, i.e., the terminating value of 𝑥 for grid 1 is 10.
Similarly, it can be inferred from figure 2(b) that the terminating
value of iteration number 𝑥 for grid 2 is 8.
6 CONCLUSION
In this work, we propose a blockchain-based framework for se-
cure and lightweight energy trading in a BS2G network. We have
adopted the blockchain data structure in our model to overcome the
limitations of traditional centralized architectures. These limitations
include high response time, security risks, and high transaction

fees. Furthermore, we propose the use of an EGT, which iteratively
calculates every grid’s selection probabilities corresponding to all
the SPBSs before converging to the optimal selection probabilities.
An ethereum smart contract is used to ensure that the energy trans-
actions between the grids and the SPBSs are secure and transparent.
Although we have modeled only the BS2G exchange, the work can
further be extended to model BS2BS, G2BS, and G2G networks.
